The costs of the Second Respondent (H's brother ("MCL")) amount to about &#163;21,000. The costs of the Third Respondent (H's father ("CL")) amount to &#163;34,032.

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">On 8 February 2005 Singer J described this case as a "power struggle" between the two families. I agree. These families have preferred to spend nearly half a million pounds in legal fees in pursuit of their respective grievances rather than to enter into a peaceable compromise. That is their undoubted right. But I wonder whether at the end of the day anyone (apart from the lawyers) will have really profited from that expenditure. </p>

This was followed by an Orthodox religious marriage in Vienna in May 1998. On 9 May 2001 their second child Alexander was born. He is now 4 years old. During their marriage the parties lived in London. They separated on 27 March 2004, and so their relationship lasted about 7 years. In August 2005, with the permission of Wilson J (as he then was), W and the children returned to live in Vienna. </p>

Since 1990 legal title has been registered in the name of H's brother MCL. It has been in H's family for a long time. According to H, MCL, CL and Mary it was purchased in 1965 with money from H's paternal grandmother and put into the name of H's parents. They moved out in 1972 leaving the paternal grandmother in occupation. At her request it was transferred into MCL's name in 1990. She had a particular affection for him as he bore the same Christian name as her husband who had been killed during the Second World War. In 1997 the paternal grandmother died and the flat was unoccupied. It was offered to H and W following their marriage. After they took up occupation a substantial sum of about &#163;50,000 was spent on renovation; this was supplied in part by H's family and in part (US$30,000) by W's father. W claims that 24 AL beneficially belongs to H. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">It is clear that during the marriage the parties enjoyed a high standard of living although the evidence is not sufficiently clear for me to assess with precision the annual monetary rate. Mr Cusworth says that was at the rate (including the discharge of school fees) of about &#163;100,000 - &#163;120,000 p.a. This lifestyle was in large measure funded by payments made through the bank accounts at Alpha Bank of a Panamanian company which I shall call SMCFSA. This is one of a number of off-shore companies that have featured in this case. Another is a Liberian company which I shall call GE, which owns a building in Central London which I shall designate 104 WS. W claims that both SMCFSA and GE are beneficially owned by H. </p>

It was clear that W was referring to Frances Hughes.

The evidence clearly establishes that the money in it has been used by H's parents to support themselves, H and their other children. </p>

His resources included the family home valued at &#163;250,000 which secured a mortgage to the bank of &#163;78,000, a bank guarantee covering contingent liabilities to Lloyds of up to &#163;100,000 and a Lloyds losses loan of &#163;43,000. His pension fund was valued at &#163;394,000 and his 25.2% shareholding in the company at &#163;600,000. His net assets, ignoring the contingent Lloyds losses were &#163;1.24m. His income from the company was &#163;2791 per month, it being company policy to pay relatively low salaries to the directors and plough back the profits. He had additional income of &#163;172 per month. Mrs Thomas had no capital and no independent source of income. At the hearing of her application for financial relief the judge held that the husband had failed to satisfy him that it was beyond his power to free the primary equity in the family home by providing the bank with alternative security. He accordingly ordered the sale of the family home and payment to the wife of &#163;158,000, which was to extinguish all capital claims, payment to the wife of periodic payments for the benefit of the children at the rate of &#163;1500 per month, and payment by the husband of the boys' school fees (&#163;12,000 p.a.). He expressed the view that the deficiency of income thus arising was one that the husband would make good by procuring changes in the company's policy towards the payment of dividends and/or the remuneration of management. It is not clear from the report whether the wife's claims for periodical payments for herself were dismissed. </p>

The availability of unidentified resources may, for example, be inferred from a spouse's expenditure or style of living, or from his inability or unwillingness to allow the complexity of his affairs to be penetrated with the precision necessary to ascertain his actual wealth or the degree of liquidity of his assets. Another is that where a spouse enjoys access to wealth but no absolute entitlement to it (as in the case, for example, of a beneficiary under a discretionary trust or someone who is dependent on the generosity of a relative), the court will not act in direct invasion of the rights of, or usurp the discretion exercisable by, a third party. Nor will it put upon a third party undue pressure to act in a way which will enhance the means of the maintaining spouse. This does not, however, mean that the court acts in total disregard of the potential availability of wealth from sources owned or administered by others. There will be occasions when it becomes permissible for a judge deliberately to frame his orders in a form which affords judicious encouragement to third parties to provide the maintaining spouse with the means to comply with the court's view of the justice of the case. There are bound to be instances where the boundary between improper pressure and judicious encouragement proves to be a fine one, and it will require attention to the particular circumstances of each case to see whether it has been crossed.'</p>

From these authorities I derive the following principles: (a) Where a husband can only raise further capital, or additional income, as the result of a decision made at the discretion of trustees, the court should not put improper pressure on the trustees to exercise that discretion for the benefit of the wife. (b) The court should not, however, be 'misled by appearances'; it should 'look at the reality of the situation'. (c) If on the balance of probability the evidence shows that, if trustees exercised their discretion to release more capital or income to a husband, the interests of the trust or of other beneficiaries would not be appreciably damaged, the court can assume that a genuine request for the exercise of such discretion would probably be met by a favourable response. In that situation if the court decides that it would be reasonable for a husband to seek to persuade trustees to release more capital or income to him to enable him to make proper financial provision for his children and his former wife, the court would not in so deciding be putting improper pressure on the trustees. In relation to the facts of the present case, I would apply these principles to the family company as if it were a trust, and the shareholders (the husband, his mother and brother) the trustees.' </p>

What happens if and when it is not? How is the court supposed to enforce its order? It could hardly be said that the payer is in wilful default justifying a penalty under the Debtors Act 1869.

The important point is that save to the extent permitted by the trust deed (e.g. remuneration) the trustee may not benefit from the assets; they are held entirely for the benefit of the beneficiaries.

	  <paragraph>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ind">In other words, trustees have no interest of their own in the trust property; their sole purpose is to deal with the trust assets for the benefit of the beneficiaries. All the powers of the trustees may be exercised only in the interests of the beneficiaries and in accordance with the terms of the trust deed. [164] What the exercise of such powers will involve will, of course, vary considerably according to the nature of the trust the number of beneficiaries, the underlying purposes behind the establishment of the trust the nature of the assets and many other factors&#8230; [165] Furthermore, it is important that the relationship between trustee and beneficiary should be harmonious. Indeed, lack of harmony may be of itself a good reason for a trustee to resign or be dismissed (see <span style="font-style:italic">Letterstedt</span> at 386). This is not surprising because the trustee's sole duty is to act for the benefit of the beneficiaries. In our judgment there is nothing untoward in beneficiaries making requests of a trustee as to the investment of the trust fund, the acquisition of properties for them to live in or for the refurbishment of properties in which they already live. In our judgment many decisions of this nature are likely to arise because of a request by a beneficiary rather than because of an independent originating action on the part of a trustee. The approach that a trustee should adopt to a request will depend upon the nature of the request, the interests of other beneficiaries and all the surrounding circumstances. Certainly, if he is to be exercising his fiduciary powers in good faith, the trustee must be willing to reject a request if he thinks that this is the right course. But when a trustee concludes that the request is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case and is in the interests of the beneficiary concerned, he should certainly not refuse the request simply in order to assert or prove his independence. His duty remains at all times to act in good faith in the interests of his beneficiaries, not to act against those interests for improper reasons. [166] In our judgment, where the requests made of trustees are reasonable in the context of all the circumstances, it would be the exception rather than the rule for trustees to refuse such requests. Indeed, as Mr Joumeaux accepted, one would expect to find that in the majority of trusts, there had not been a refusal by the trustees of a request by a settlor. This would no doubt be because, in the majority of cases, a settlor would be acting reasonably in the interests of himself and his family. This would particularly be so where there was a small close-knit family and where the settlor could be expected to be fully aware of what was in the interests of his family. Indeed, in almost all discretionary trusts, the settlor provides a letter of wishes which expresses informally his desires in relation to the administration of the settlement. Furthermore he may change his wishes from time to time. In our judgment it is perfectly clear that trustees are entitled (see <span style="font-style:italic">Abacus Trust Company (Isle of Man) Ltd v Barr</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 All ER 763" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 All ER 763</ref>) to take account of such wishes as the settlor may from time to time express provided, of course, that the trustees are not in any way bound by them. The trustees must reach their own independent conclusion having taken account of such wishes. [167] On numerous occasions during the course of the hearing Mr Journeaux was driven to repeat that Abacus had not rejected any request of Sheikh Fahad. A lack of any refusal may of course be indicative of the fact that trustees have abdicated their fiduciary duties and are simply following the wishes of the settlor without further consideration. But, as mentioned above, a lack of any refusal may be equally consistent with a properly administered trust where the trustees have in good faith considered each request of the settlor, concluded that it is reasonable and concluded that it is proper to accede to such requests in the interests of one or more of the beneficiaries of the trust. But one does not start, as at times seems to have been the plaintiffs' case, with an attitude that it is very surprising and worthy of criticism that the trustee acceded to all Sheikh Fahad's requests. On the contrary, as the Privy Council said in <span style="font-style:italic">Letterstedt</span>, trustees exist for the benefit of beneficiaries and it is in our judgment very common that trustees will have perfectly properly acceded to all the requests of a settlor without in any way abdicating their fiduciary duties and responsibilities.' </p>

If the court makes a reasonable request of trustees to make funds available to meet an ancillary relief award then it can assume that ordinarily the trustees will accede to such a request. The same cannot be assumed of a request of a mere donor, for it is his prerogative to be unreasonable, if that is his inclination. </p>

The husband worked in a pharmaceutical business acquired by the wife's family. The shares of the business were held equally by the husband and the wife. From 1966 the husband worked for a well-known public company. He had a good salary and prospects and would receive a pension at the age of 60, but he had no capital assets. The wife was a member of a wealthy family and the pattern of the married life was that out of her large resources, she provided the home. The wife was a beneficiary under two settlements. Under the first, made by her father in 1951, the trustees had power in their absolute discretion to vest the whole or any part of the trust capital in the wife absolutely. Under the second, made in 1965, of which she herself was the settlor, she was permitted to withdraw all or any part of the trust-fund with the consent of the trustees, although evidence was given by one trustee that their policy was not to consent to the withdrawal of funds from the settlement; but that trustee was the wife's solicitor. The values of the settlements in October 1981 were &#163;78,000 and &#163;212,000 respectively. In addition the wife had substantial free assets consisting of her home, jewellery, a stamp collection, and the proceeds of sale of a house, together worth from &#163;110,000 to &#163;120,000. The wife had suffered for many years from multiple sclerosis leading to increasing disability and consequently increasing expenditure. The children had been amply provided for by the settlement on them of the husband's and wife's shares in the pharmaceutical company and by other family settlements. In addition they were to receive the capital of the trust-funds on the wife's death. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The husband applied for financial relief in the form of a lump sum sufficient for him to buy a house appropriate to his position. Booth J ordered the wife to pay him &#163;50,000 in full and final settlement of his claim. On appeal the wife contended that the effect of the order had been to put improper pressure on her trustee. The appeal was dismissed. Ormrod LJ held: </p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">'The first question is whether the wife's interests under the settlements are 'other financial resources', e.g. of a capital nature. Under the 1951 settlement the trustees have power to vest the trust-fund, or part of it, in the wife 'in their absolute discretion'; under the 1965 settlement the wife, with the consent of the trustees, can revoke it in whole or in part. Both settlements are potential sources of capital for the wife and are, therefore 'other financial resources', though not under her absolute control. Some assessment must be made of the worth of these potential sources of capital to her, not necessarily in valuers' terms, but in terms of the practical realities of life, or in terms of reasonable expectations. As Lord Merrivale said in <span style="font-style:italic">N v N</span> (1928) 44 TLR 324, p. 327, the ecclesiastical courts 'showed a degree of practical wisdom. . . . They were not misled by appearances . . . they looked at realities.' Much the same was said by this court in <span style="font-style:italic">O'D v O'D</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1976] Fam. 83" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1976">[1976] Fam. 83</ref>, p. 90. Looked at in this way the potential of the 1951 settlement may be small, but that of the 1965 settlement is great. The wife herself was the settlor, settling her own money on herself for life, for her own purposes, and retaining a power of revocation subject only to the consent of the trustees. It is not to be supposed that the trustees would withhold their consent if the wife wished to free capital for any reasonable purpose, more especially when the other beneficiaries are already amply provided for. Balancing the financial resources of each party and their respective needs, giving full weight to the wife's exceptional needs, particularly in the future, it is impossible to regard a lump sum of &#163;50,000 as an unreasonable sum for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss. 23</ref> and 25 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>. The next question, and it is often the crucial question in these cases, is practicability. It is at this stage that the court has to consider such problems as liquidity, the cost of raising money on mortgage or overdraft, the effect on a business of withdrawing a substantial capital sum and so on. These are practical matters and must be approached realistically, 'penetrating to the underlying realities' (O'D v O'D (above)), and 'not being misled by appearances' (N v N (above)). In this case the question is, 'Is it practicable for the wife to raise the sum of &#163;50,000?' To start with she has &#163;28,300, plus accumulated interest, from the sale of 9 Clumber Crescent North on deposit or in cash. There remains a balance of &#163;21,000. In a case such as this it is distasteful, and ought to be unnecessary, to look at the wife's personal possessions, but the attitude of her trustees make it unavoidable. She could, undoubtedly, but painfully, raise such a lump sum from her stamps (which in this case are real assets, if not investments) and her jewellery, or she could borrow it (at great and unnecessary expense) by way of mortgage. Alternatively, she could withdraw a relatively small part of the 1965 settlement fund with the consent of her trustees. The consequent loss of income would not be significant, and could be made good by reinvesting part of the fund which will, or may, involve some capital gains tax. The judge concluded that the trustees would, reluctantly no doubt, give their consent to enable her to comply with the order, but it is pointed out by Mr Jackson that one of the trustees gave evidence before the judge which indicated that the trustee's policy was not to consent to the withdrawal of any more funds from the settlement. This produces a somewhat invidious situation which becomes positively embarrassing when the trustee in question is also acting as the wife's solicitor in bitterly contested matrimonial proceedings. It makes it difficult to know what weight to attach to his expression of intention. One might expect that the trustees would wait to see the outcome of the proceedings before exercising their discretion under the settlement. </p>

The husband had no substantial means whereas the wife was the daughter and granddaughter of women with substantial assets, most of them out of the country. The wife had an interest in two trusts, one of them set up in Jersey, and both of them as a result of the assets of her mother. On the imminent death of her mother the Jersey trust was set up to redistribute the assets in such a way that they would not attract taxation in this country. Her interest was as the sole beneficiary worth something in the region, according to the judge's order, of &#163;430,000. In addition, there was a further trust set up in Switzerland, taking effect in Liechtenstein, which was worth, again according to the figures presented to Wood J, a sum between &#163;100,000 and &#163;145,000. It was not entirely clear whether she was the sole beneficiary of the Liechtenstein trust, but nothing had been said to lead the court to believe that there was any other beneficiary. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">They separated in 1983. In February 1986 Wood J made an order for the wife to pay a lump sum of &#163;175,000 to the husband and costs. Upon the wife failing to pay within the proper time two applications for committal were granted, both suspended on terms. The wife then made applications for leave to appeal and to extend time for appealing against the order of February 1986 and for leave to appeal and an extension of time for appealing against the suspended committal orders. By the time of the appeal hearing the capital sum of &#163;175,000 had been paid. Nevertheless, the wife contended that the judge had been wrong, first, in finding that she exercised effective control over two trust funds, which had been set up outside the jurisdiction, and of which she was the beneficiary; and secondly, in making an order which would exert pressure upon discretionary trustees. Butler Sloss LJ held </p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">'In considering whether or not, as the judge found, she had effective control over these trusts, it is of some relevance to note that, prior to the divorce and parting of the husband and wife, every application by the wife for funds for herself and for her husband for any of the pursuits that they wished to engage in, pleasure as well as the buying of property, was met and the sums asked for were advanced at the request of the wife. Although, perhaps, the phrase 'effective control' might more appropriately be expressed as 'immediate access to the funds', in my judgment, the judge was entirely justified in coming to the conclusion as at 6 February that every request had been granted and that she was in a position to ask for money and to have it paid, and there was nothing to show that the trustees would not do so. The second point that Mr Connell makes is that the subsequent events have shown that the trustees have acted totally independently of the wife, that they are not doing what she wishes them to do and that she has no access to the funds at this stage because they choose not to help her out in the situation in which she now finds herself. But, again, it is of some interest to note that this wife was not at all anxious at many stages of this prolonged litigation that the trustees should pay out. The wife had undoubtedly indicated, both in publicity and in what she had said to the trustees, that she held a very poor opinion of the husband, and the views expressed by the trustees in correspondence which has been shown to this court leads one to see that their view of the husband must undoubtedly be coloured by the way in which she had expressed her views of him. </p>

	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">&#8230; This is not, in my judgment, a case of improper pressure upon the trustees by the court or by the husband's side. Looking at reality, she is the sole beneficiary of some &#163;430,000 in Jersey and a lesser sum in Switzerland. The amount of money that was due to be paid by the wife over and above assets in this country at the time of the judge's judgment was some &#163;60,000 at most. That money was perfectly able to have been paid and the judge was entitled, in my judgment, in February to believe that it would be paid. I, for my part, believe that it would be paid today if the trustees were absolutely satisfied that the wife had to have the money.' </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">What is important to deduce from this decision is that it was found as a matter of fact that the wife had effective control over the trusts in that the trustees had historically always been responsive to her wishes. It can therefore be seen that this was not, in reality, a case of judicious encouragement at all, but rather a case of determining the true extent of the wife's resources. When that is understood it can be seen that the award was modest in its scope and entirely unassailable. But even absent the finding of control the award was justified, as the provision of the money to meet it represented a proper discharge of the trustees' fiduciary obligations towards their beneficiary. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">X v X</span> was a very different case to this. The husband and wife were both practising Jews. On the breakdown of the 5-year marriage, the wife's family entered into detailed negotiations with the husband to ensure that the husband did not issue divorce proceedings based on the wife's adultery, and that the husband would grant the wife a get, permitting her to remarry under Jewish religious law. An agreement was eventually reached under which the husband would be paid &#163;500,000 provided that (1) the get had been given, (2) a decree nisi had been obtained on suitable terms, and (3) a financial order had been made. Although the wife herself apparently had no resources, she came from an extremely wealthy family, and the &#163;500,000 was to be provided by the wife's brother. The brother's solicitors gave both the wife's and the husband's solicitors an undertaking that &#163;500,000 was being held in their client's account and would be paid under the terms of the agreement, provided those terms had been met by a certain date. The get was duly granted by the husband and a decree nisi was eventually granted on the basis of the wife's undefended petition alleging unreasonable behaviour by the husband. There was a delay in obtaining the decree, because the particulars had to be amended to satisfy the district judge that a sufficient case of unreasonable behaviour had been disclosed. The major problem arose when the terms of the agreed financial order were presented to the court for approval, as the district judge refused to approve a settlement in which the wife, apparently without any means whatever, paid a lump sum of &#163;500,000 to the husband, who had assets of over &#163;600,000 and a net income of &#163;75,000 per year. The wife's solicitors refused to take any further action to obtain a financial order and the brother's solicitors refused to pay over the money before the financial order was made. The husband's application asking the wife to show cause why the minutes of the agreement should not be made an order of the court was not heard until after the time-limit on the undertaking had expired. However, the husband was able to obtain a freezing order preventing the brother's solicitors from dealing with the &#163;500,000 until after the hearing. </p>

	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in">'[52] The wife's evidence is that, apart from some jewellery, worth less than the husband believes, and one car, a Mercedes, she has no assets of her own. She accepts that she is provided with credit cards which are settled for her by her family. The other cars of which she has the use and the house in which she lives (and its contents) all belong, she says, to her family. She denies that she has any bank account in Switzerland. Her bank account in this country is funded, she says, by her family and any money in it is theirs. Nor, she says, does she have any interest in any family funds, not even as a discretionary beneficiary. She has never worked and claims always to have been supported - plainly at a very high level - by her family's generosity, both before and even during her marriage. She describes her family as having been 'extremely generous towards us as a couple'. [53] There are some specific indications of the extent of that generosity. The wife says that she spent about &#163;250,000 (provided by her family) in completely refurbishing and redecorating the first matrimonial home in which she and her husband lived. It is common ground that in 1998 the wife's father provided her with a fund of either $500,000 (her figure) or &#163;500,000 (the husband's figure) to enable her to trade as a hobby on NASDAQ. She is now living in what is plainly a very valuable house, according to the husband - and not denied by her, though she makes no admissions - worth 'many millions of pounds'. It is owned, she thinks, by her brother, who pays all the running costs, though the contents, she says, belong to her parents. On top of that, of course, on her own case her brother has been prepared to fund the &#163;500,000 agreed to be paid to the husband. </p>

He says that the true scale of what resources are available to the wife is unknown and will probably never be known. But, he submits, were it necessary for me to come to such a finding, I could, consistently with <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas v Thomas</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 668" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 668</ref>, properly conclude on the evidence that the wife's resources are more than sufficiently substantial as to justify an order in favour of the husband in the sum of &#163;500,000. [60] But, says Mr Pointer, that does not really matter for present purposes. The husband, he says, was entitled to take the view that he will never get to the bottom of what the wife's resources are and, in those circumstances, to settle on the available terms. Indeed, says Mr Pointer, this is a case in which, although each party's position is that the other has failed to make full and frank disclosure (see paras [51], [54] and [55] above), neither spouse has thought it necessary to investigate the other's finances in detail before reaching agreement. Both, he says, were content to reach agreement on the basis of what they knew. This was in the circumstances an entirely appropriate and sensible approach. And, he submits, the court should not impede such an approach. [61] I agree. I am considering a <span style="font-style:italic">Dean v Dean</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1978] Fam 161" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1978">[1978] Fam 161</ref> application. In that context, as it seems to me, it is not at the end of the day vital for me to determine what her family is actually worth or to reach a concluded view as to the scale of the wife's financial resources. What is important, as it seems to me, is that (i) the husband believed his wife to have access to very substantial resources and her family to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds, (ii) the wife and her family saw no reason to seek to persuade him otherwise, (iii) both parties were prepared to strike a deal on a basis which, if properly analysed, assumed that the wife did indeed have available to her substantial resources, and (iv) both parties were content to reach agreement on the basis of what they knew, or thought they knew, of the other's resources and without any detailed investigation of each other's finances. [62] I should add that, were it necessary for me to come to such a finding, I would, applying the principles in <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas v Thomas</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 668" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 668</ref>, be prepared to conclude on the evidence before me that the wife does indeed have available to her very substantial resources and that her resources, whatever they may be, are more than sufficiently substantial as in principle to justify an order in favour of the husband in the sum of &#163;500,000.' </p>

I will make such orders for contact as are in the children's best interests. Whether or not it extends to what CL and Mary want remains to be seen. I would like to think that they will accept my decision, whatever it is, and that the condition about contact will fall away. We will have to see. </p>

I am sorry to say that his affidavit was very misleading so far as his means were concerned. He presented himself as a mere employee of a building firm and possessing no stocks or shares. He omitted to say that his wife owned a controlling shareholding in one building company and that he himself had a 50% shareholding in another. The scale of that building firm's business is obviously extensive. I have no doubt whatever that he could easily raise &#8364;200,000 to put into the trust if he wanted to. The refusal to do so is all about face. </p>

In construing <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22</ref> as embracing the applicant's need for cash to finance the continuing litigation, and at least implicitly approving that practice, Mr Aderemi has quite rightly said that my observations in <span style="font-style:italic">McFarlane</span> were, strictly speaking, obiter. I accept that that is the correct classification. Nonetheless, the passage is a pretty clear indication of where I stand on this issue. In short, it seems to me that the progressive construction that the judges have adopted in the Family Division is both pragmatic and sensible. I accept that at the date of the advent of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/45" uk:canonical="1970 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970</ref> (1 January 1971) no judge of the Division would have so construed <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22</ref>, particularly because one of the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/45" uk:canonical="1970 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1970 Act</ref> was to remove the wife's agency of necessity and with it her opportunity to seek security for the costs of future litigation. But times have moved on. In the 1970s a petitioner who had no assets and whose only prospect of affluence lay in the outcome of her application for ancillary relief could easily find specialist solicitors who would pursue her claim on legal aid. That world has long since gone. In those days a number of the leading specialist ancillary relief firms could, as a matter of public duty, take on an admittedly small number of legally-aided cases. Leading firms that would not take legally-aided clients invariably had an arrangement to pass such cases to highly competent firms that would do legal aid. All those support systems have disappeared. The modern reality is that the highly specialist solicitors and counsel necessary for the conduct of big money cases will no longer do publicly-funded work. So if the applicant has no assets, can give no security for borrowings, cannot guarantee an outcome that would enable her to enter into an arrangement such as that which was upheld in <span style="font-style:italic">Sears Tooth v Payne Hicks Beach</span>, then there is no source of funding of the litigation other than the approach to the court for a maintenance pending suit that will include a substantial element to fund the cost of the litigation. Obviously in all these cases the dominant safeguard against injustice is the discretion of the trial judge, and it will only be in cases that are demonstrated to be exceptional that the court will consider exercising the jurisdiction. But I am in no doubt that in such exceptional cases <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22</ref> can in modern times be construed to extend that far.

It is clear that a costs allowance is not a costs order. It is a maintenance order that enables a party to fund the costs of her case. So, if and when the proposed reforms to the costs rules ever come into force, the general principle in those draft rules of "no order as to costs" will not apply to inhibit a court from awarding a costs allowance if it is otherwise appropriate to do so. </p>

A simple statement from her solicitors stating that they were not prepared to enter into a <span style="font-style:italic">Sears Tooth v Payne Hicks Beach</span> charge should ordinarily deal with the third requirement. </p>

In every case I would expect that a fairly detailed estimate of the costs expected to be incurred up to the FDR should be produced. If the FDR fails then the judge in the subsequent directions phase can consider whether to extend the allowance up to trial and, if so, in what amount. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">One of the problems with a costs allowance is the conceptual difficulty of reckoning the payments at final trial. Does one pretend that the payments have not been made and notionally add back the sums to the payer's side of the ledger, while simultaneously increasing the amount of unpaid costs on the payee's? Or does one present the figures as they are, in which event it could be said that the court's ultimate discretion over costs has to some extent been pre-empted? It is on account of these difficulties that I think that, generally speaking, an applicant should be required to give an undertaking (1) only to apply the costs allowance to the payment of costs and (2) to repay such part of the costs allowance at trial if, and to the extent that, the court is of the opinion, when considering costs, that she ought to do so. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">A solution to these problems would be for the Government to bring into force the provisions in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> that enable the Court to award an interim lump sum. Sadly, there seems little prospect of that happening. But it may be sensible in cases where the question of costs' funding arises, where it is common ground that the applicant will recover a lump sum, for the respondent to offer an interim lump sum on terms that (1) it is used only for costs funding and (2) credit is given against the ultimate lump sum in respect of the payment. In this way the conceptual difficulties disappear as well as the irritant of having to make the monthly payments. If such an offer were to be made then ex hypothesi the applicant would have "assets" which would prevent her, under the first requirement, from being able to seek a costs allowance. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">In this case there was no detailed estimate of the costs that W expected to incur. She merely asked for &#163;10,000 per month to cover not only her ancillary relief costs but also her costs in relation to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> proceedings. It was not stated for how long it was being asked that the payments should continue - implicitly up to final trial. W advanced no evidence that she could not obtain funding from other sources, and of course, when H did not pay, her father paid the costs. The District Judge considered the figure too high and awarded &#163;5,000 per month. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">I therefore dismiss the appeal in respect of the general maintenance, school fees and rent, and allow it in respect of the costs allowance. This would give rise to a sum of arrears, which I have not computed. I shall remit those arrears. If they were to be calculated and paid then W's asset base would be that much higher, and her lump sum need that much lower. It is therefore a pointless exercise. </p>
