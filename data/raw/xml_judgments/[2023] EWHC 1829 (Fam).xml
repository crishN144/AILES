	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Because of the delay which has troubled this case, in December 2022 I contacted counsel for the husband and for the wife to ascertain whether they would like to have my decision in advance of delivery of the full Judgment.  Having been informed by counsel for H and W that they did indeed want to know the outcome, with reasons to follow, on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December I informed the parties that it was my clear decision that I was going to accede to the wife&#8217;s application and set aside the consent order. I had reached this decision after a thorough re-read of the evidence and the comprehensive written submissions.  I had the benefit of Livenote transcription.  I had hoped that this information would enable the parties to re-commence the unfortunate process of filing new information, presumably starting with the filing of a fresh Form E and then, in the usual way, exchanging questionnaires and requests for information and documents. Regrettably, although not unreasonably complaining about the delay, the husband has declined to engage in this process.  Although I did not feel it appropriate to insist that it was a condition of my delivering the outcome in advance of the detailed Judgment, I am bound to say that I regarded it as an implied understanding, otherwise there was little point in doing as the parties had requested.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The gist of the wife&#8217;s case, analysed in detail below, is that, contrary to the husband&#8217;s evidence, his ability to spend from his directors&#8217; loan account was not restricted to &#163;1 million as he had represented.  Instead, the wife asserts, between January 2018 and December 2019, the husband was able to draw down &#163;9.9 million. Furthermore, the wife asserts that the husband had an undisclosed ability to borrow &#163;3 million from his brother. Further, it is alleged that the husband had, at the time of the hearing of the set aside application, made an offer to purchase a property for &#163;5 million, that he was under a clear duty to disclose this, and that he failed to disclose it.  Mr Howard KC and Ms Chapman assert on behalf of the wife that:</p>

If the court had known the true financial position, it would not have made the order it did. W would have pressed for a higher lump sum, far sooner, and in default of H being able so to provide, would have pursued the case for a sale of the business and the receipt of 50% of the net proceeds.</span>&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband is described by his counsel in the set aside proceedings, Mr Todd KC and Mr Kenny, as someone who &#8220;achieves liquidity through relationships with all manner of lenders including his brother&#8221; and that, &#8220;she always knew that H&#8217;s financial affairs were like the proverbial Greek gift for keeping plates spinning in the air&#8221;. The gist of the husband&#8217;s case is that he is an experienced &#8220;wheeler and dealer&#8221; and that it should come as no surprise to the wife that he has managed to arrange his affairs in the way that he has since the conclusion of the proceedings in 2018. The forceful complaint made on behalf of the husband is that the wife has adopted a &#8220;scattergun approach to this litigation&#8221;. It is said on his behalf that there is no undisclosed asset of any kind and there is no undisclosed intention of any material kind. It is said that the husband was always going to go on trading, buying and selling property, and that was how he would make his money. Mr Todd asserts that:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">This is a classic case of a wife suffering from buyer&#8217;s remorse; then scrabbling around to find a justification for her revisiting her bargain. She has sought to make up for a lack of a &#8216;killer blow&#8217; (which would enable the order to be set aside) with an attempt at a death by a thousand cuts. But as each one of these fails, then Medusa -like, a new one appears.</span>&#8221;</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An application to set aside on the basis of fraudulent non-disclosure will always be &#8220;high-stakes litigation&#8221;. Whilst, of course, the judge will always have an open mind on the question of costs, both parties know that it is overwhelmingly likely that, in an application such as this, the unsuccessful party is likely to be ordered to pay the costs. I also bear in mind that if a litigant succeeds in setting aside a court order, then the whole process is likely to start again.  Sometimes the applicant may have unearthed a single undisclosed asset (the &#8220;killer blow&#8221; as Mr Todd would have it put).  In other cases, such as here, the non-disclosure may be regarded as having undermined the entire negotiation process.  Of course, circumstances may very well have changed, offering no certainty that the &#8220;winner&#8221; in the set-aside application will succeed in securing a higher award.  I purposely said in court that, even if I were to set aside the consent order, it would not automatically result in a higher award for the wife, particularly in circumstances where, as here, the world has undergone such colossal, unprecedented and unexpected changes that have been brought about by the global pandemic and the war in Ukraine. That, of course, is an issue for another day, but I would have expected the husband to volunteer his current financial circumstances without waiting for a court order, in an attempt to persuade the wife that the possibility referred to by me above could be the reality. Instead, the husband has chosen, as is his right, to say nothing more about his current financial circumstances. However, whilst the husband not unreasonably complains about the delay in the receipt of this Judgment, at the same time he adds to the delay by declining to engage in the discovery process that inevitably follows a set-aside order.</p>

The agreement itself had been approved by me in late February 2018 and so, as was accepted by all, it became a <span style="font-style:italic">Rose</span> order on that day in February, in other words an unperfected but binding agreement. Given the experience and quality of the respective legal teams, neither party could have been in any doubt that they had entered into a binding agreement. Moreover, when approving the agreement, I made it absolutely clear that this was a binding agreement. I indicated to the parties that, whilst of course I had not made any final decision because I had not yet heard all of the evidence, nor of course the closing submissions, the agreement which they had entered into was very much along the lines of what I thought was an appropriate resolution of the case. In saying this, I was not just acting as a &#8220;rubber stamp&#8221;, it was a genuine statement that I approved the agreement that had been so painstakingly negotiated.  Counsel would have known, as of course anyone practising in this field of law knows, that valuing a business is an uncertain art and that an outcome that provided the wife with the property that she wanted plus more cash than she could ever need was an outcome with complete certainty and security for her.</p>

So, in approving it as I do now, neither of you can get out of it, unless something completely unforeseeable happens&#8230; This deal is this deal whatever happens in the overseas litigation, you are not in any way making it contingent upon that, so whether it does well or badly, that is the deal you have got&#8230; I unhesitatingly endorse and approve of this agreement.</span>&#8221;</p>

For the avoidance of doubt, the trustees have always maintained that they leave the running of the businesses entirely to the husband.

Because of the large difference between the respective company valuations and, as the wife put it, her distrust of the husband, the wife was seeking an orderly sale of the business.  The wife had contended through her counsel that there was a considerable advantage in a sale, it being the only manner of discovering the true value of the company, &#8220;rather than any outcome predicated on the accepted fragility of expert opinion (especially such a gloomy one as H seeks to rely on)&#8221;. The wife had asserted that a 50% share in the business (assuming sold in December 2020) was &#163;46.3 million. This figure was predicated on the basis of her own expert, Kellie Gread of PwC. Mr Lane, on behalf of the husband, had valued the business at 15.6 million which, suggested Ms Gread, was a &#8220;fire sale&#8221; valuation.</p>

As I analyse below, the husband has had good fortune in two areas in particular of his business life, one being the sale of a real property asset and the other being the resolution of some highly expensive overseas litigation. The husband asserts, as was plainly the case, that the wife took a view in respect of both of these assets, and he says that she should not be allowed to &#8220;have a second bite of the cherry&#8221;.

The Supreme Court went on to say that a party who had practised deception with a view to a particular end, which had been achieved by it, could not be allowed to deny its materiality; that the victim of the misrepresentation which had led her to compromise her claim to financial remedies in a matrimonial case should not be in a worse position than the victim of fraudulent misrepresentation in an ordinary contract case, including a contract to settle a civil claim; and that, only if the perpetrator of the fraud satisfied the court that, at the time it had made the consent order, the fraud would not have influenced a reasonable person to agree to it and that, had it known then what it knew now, the court would not have made a significantly different order, would the court not set aside the consent order in those circumstances.</p>

The general principle that &#8220;fraud unravelled all&#8221; was applicable to court orders and the wife was entitled to reopen the case, when she could seek to negotiate a new settlement or a rehearing of her claims when all the relevant facts were known; that, therefore, the wife had been deprived of a full and fair hearing of her claims.</p>

If there had been such non-disclosure, but it had been accidental or negligent, the wife would also have had to establish that the effect of the non-disclosure was such that the 2004 order was substantially different from the order which would have been made (or agreed) if the husband had afforded proper disclosure &#8211; see per Lord Brandon of Oakbrook in Livesey (formerly Jenkins) v Jenkins <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1985] AC 424" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1985">[1985] AC 424</ref> at 445. However, as the non-disclosure alleged by the wife in this case is said to be intentional, then, if there was such non-disclosure, the 2004 order should be set aside, unless the husband could satisfy the court that the 2004 order would have been agreed and made in any event &#8211; see per Lady Hale in Sharland v Sharland <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2015/60" uk:canonical="[2015] UKSC 60" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] UKSC 60</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] 2 FLR 1367" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] 2 FLR 1367</ref>, at [29]-[33]. In other words, where a party&#8217;s non-disclosure was inadvertent, there is no presumption that it was material and the onus is on the other party to show that proper disclosure would, on the balance of probabilities, have led to a different order; whereas where a party&#8217;s non-disclosure was intentional, it is deemed to be material, so that it is presumed that proper disclosure would have led to a different order, unless that party can show, on the balance of probabilities, that it would not have done so.</span>&#8221;</p>

It is clear from Dietz and from Livesey that the misrepresentation or non-disclosure must be material to the decision that the court made at the time. But this is a case of fraud. It would be extraordinary if the victim of a fraudulent misrepresentation, which had led her to compromise a claim to financial remedies in a matrimonial case, were in a worse position than the victim of a fraudulent misrepresentation in an ordinary contract case, including a contract to settle a civil claim. As was held in Smith v Kay (1859) 7HL Cas 750, a party who has practised deception with a view to a particular end, which had been obtained by it, cannot be allowed to deny its materiality. Furthermore, the court is in no position to protect the victim from the deception, or to conduct its statutory duties properly, because the court too has been deceived.</span></p>

But in my view, the burden of satisfying the court of that must lie with the perpetrator of the fraud.

It is said that the wife refused to explain her case. The wife answered that she really did not know how her husband was going to raise the money, but that was a matter for him. Mr Todd submits that the wife refused to answer this question because she was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">on the horns of a dilemma; she knew the moment she confessed that she knew so, instead, she played ignorant; she simply ignored the issue.</span>&#8221;<marker name="tab"/><br/>Mr Todd submits that the wife was being dishonest, that she was supported by a large and experienced legal team and that they must have intensely examined and discussed how the husband was likely to meet his obligations. He says that the wife refused to accept the obvious, which is that the husband was going to pay her from his ongoing business dealings. Broadly, I agree with the submission that the wife must have accepted that the husband was going to fund the settlement from his ongoing business dealings. However, there of course is a vast difference between &#8220;ongoing business dealings&#8221; and undisclosed assets or deals.  Sometimes people settle cases without knowing where the money is going to come from but they believe that the paying party will, somehow, get hold of the money; or even that the paying party is being less than honest. But it can never be a defence to a claim to set aside a consent order on the basis of non-disclosure for the alleged non-discloser to say, &#8220;well, they always knew I was dishonest so what&#8217;s the problem?&#8221; Although this is not the case being put forward by the husband, at times it does seem to me that he was getting close to asserting this.</p>

EK&#8217;s case at the final hearing was that her housing needs would be met by a large, brand new and vastly expensive property, which was being marketed for sale at just under &#163;5m. She was very clear that this was the property she wanted. It was always anticipated that I would also need to have a house to live in. There was no reason why my home should be inferior to hers. I am not aware of there being any suggestion that our housing needs would not be comparable (certainly, I cannot think of any realistic arguments one could deploy to say this would be the case).</span>&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">I regret that I find it impossible to reconcile this passage of his statement where he quotes his own oral evidence about his housing with what was, surreptitiously, actually going on later regarding the purchase of the new property. The truth is that when he was giving this evidence, he was deeply involved in negotiating the purchase of the new property.  I do not for a moment suggest that the husband was not entitled to a substantial property, and I do not dissent from his proposition that there was no reason for his property to be inferior to the one that was being purchased for the wife.  However, this was about timing and liquidity.  I ask myself this question: if the husband had told the court that he that day was making &#8220;a final bid&#8221; of &#163;Xm for the new property, would it have made a difference to the way that the court and the wife regarded the case? The answer is obvious, as is the reason why the husband withheld this information.</p>

As the judge, of course I was anxious to see that both parties would have appropriate housing and I was troubled about ordering the husband to buy a property for the wife if he had nowhere to live himself.  The husband quite properly asked me for my understanding in relation to his dyslexia which he said made managing documents and written material difficult for him and of course I always ensured that he had as much time as he asked for to deal with the documents. However, his business acumen is demonstrated by his conspicuous success over decades, and it is impossible for me to find that he simply &#8220;forgot&#8221; to tell the wife or the court about the new property or that he thought that it was immaterial to the evidence that he was giving. In my judgment it was important information that he deliberately withheld from the court. </p>

At the time that the parties entered into their agreement, the issue was not only about value but liquidity. It is obvious that the wife and her legal team would have been more than just interested in the fact that the husband could afford to buy a property for &#163;X million, given the evidence that he had just given. However, and I suggest of equal importance, as the judge I certainly would have been extremely interested in this fact and it would certainly have affected the way that I was looking at the case. The timing of this agreement, albeit that it was subject to contract, makes it impossible for the husband to say that this immensely significant event, namely the agreement to purchase the new property, was unimportant.  Given the timing of the offer, of the memorandum of sale, it is obvious that this was not just on his mind, but of central importance to him.  He knew that he had to withhold the information from the wife and from the court and I find that he did so deliberately and that this amounts to a lie by omission.</p>

The husband complains that this unfairly means that his post marital success in resolving the overseas litigation and in selling the real property asset and, doubtless other issues, will now unfairly be able to be taken into account. What happens at the next hearing is, of course, a matter for the next hearing, but the husband must accept that his deliberate concealment of important information has consequences. I make it clear that nothing that I have said in this Judgment will prevent the husband from arguing, if he so chooses, that post separation events should be taken into account in his favour and that he has made an unmatched contribution since the separation. That is not a matter for me at this stage.</p>

In my judgement it does not make any material difference to the decision that I presently have to make. The important factor, for me, is that the husband gave the evidence that he did about lack of liquidity, yet had found it possible on the very day of the consent order being approved, to confirm an offer of &#163;X million on the new property. This offer, of course, was accepted and the purchase went ahead. The husband said in his evidence that he was regularly notified about properties. That may very well be true and is, in my judgement, of little help to him in the context of the new property. As Mr Howard has demonstrated, the documents in the bundle show that the husband had shown persistent interest in the new property since at least late January 2018. This gives the lie to the husband&#8217;s suggestion that the new property arose at short notice. However, I am clear that whether the possibility of purchasing this property came at short notice or late January, he still had a clear duty to disclose the intended purchase to the court and to the wife.</p>

On the basis of what I have set out above I find that this is a clear lie. So, I find that he not only lied by omission in 2018, but he also lied to the court at the hearing of the set-aside application. The husband also asserted that he was not in a position to contemplate such opportunities until after the hearing concluded. Plainly he was contemplating such opportunities and, again, I find that he was lying about this. I do accept, however, that he could not commit to such an opportunity until the proceedings were over. As I have set out above, the offer was conveyed by him within, literally, minutes of the conclusion of the final draft order being approved.</p>

The husband&#8217;s solicitors, of course acting on the husband&#8217;s instructions, declined to deal with the steps that the husband had taken in relation to the new property before the final draft order was approved. In his witness statement the husband tried to deal with relevant assertions made in the wife&#8217;s witness statement, for example when she asserted that the husband must already have had an offer accepted on the property purchase. The husband declined to answer some of the wife&#8217;s pertinent questions about the property purchase.</p>

The SDLT that was paid was the personal rate not the higher company rate. The loan document from the husband&#8217;s brother dated April 2018 states that the purpose of the loan is to assist the borrower in the purchase of a home. It does not make any reference to company investment. Furthermore, the husband was clear in his evidence that he would not be paying any capital gains tax on any increase in value of the property because he would be claiming it as his principal private residence.</p>

As Mr Howard points out, he even spent &#163;100,000 on mirrors for the property. This is again relevant to the issue of the husband&#8217;s liquidity.  Thus, whilst I recognise that the husband had business successes after this date, I note that the &#163;750,000 expenditure on the property was mostly incurred prior to the overseas litigation issue being resolved.</p>

Had the husband disclosed the fact that he was intending to purchase the new property during the course of his oral evidence, I suspect that it is likely that the wife&#8217;s legal team would have applied for a great deal more documentary evidence and the wife was deprived of having her legal team ask any questions or seeking any documentary evidence in relation to the purchase of the new property and where the money was coming from.</p>

In my judgement it is unnecessary for me to find specifically whether the husband was purchasing the property as a home for himself or as an investment.  Indeed, it could very well have been both, with the husband having the added advantage of being able to persuade HMRC that any profit was not taxable because it was the husband&#8217;s principal private residence.  As Mr Todd&#8217;s analysis shows, there were all sorts of fiscal considerations at play as to whether the property was purchased through a company or by the husband as an individual.</p>

It is not to be forgotten that the husband had agreed to a simultaneous exchange of contracts and completion of the new property within six weeks of the formal offer. Whilst the husband may be strictly correct in telling the court that he could not then be sure that he would have been able to raise the money, and I accept that the offer was of course subject to contract, it was obviously relevant for the wife and the court to know that this offer had been made; but the husband deliberately concealed it. I am also prepared to accept that the brother&#8217;s offer to lend money to the husband may have been contingent upon the case being resolved. Indeed, I can well understand that the brother would not have been willing to make money available only for the husband have to pass it straight onto the wife. That is obvious common sense. However, if the husband knew that he was able to afford to buy this property moments after the case was settled, he had a clear duty to share that knowledge with the wife and with the court.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the husband, Mr Todd has forcefully suggested that the wife was not honest in her evidence about the husband&#8217;s brother. Mr Todd complains that the wife suggested in her evidence that the husband was being repaid money that had been &#8220;parked with him by DK&#8221;.  I accept that the wife has not, at least at this stage, sought to establish that case and of course therefore I ignore her suggestion, which is no more than speculation until otherwise established.  I do not find it at all surprising, however, that the wife may have wondered whether the husband&#8217;s brother was sheltering money for the husband, given the fact that the husband said nothing about it and then the money appeared straight after the court order was made. I also do not blame her in suggesting to the court, as Mr Todd complains that she did, that the loan was a soft loan. Nothing that I say here should be in any way interpreted as a finding, or even a suspicion, by me that the husband&#8217;s brother was returning to the husband the husband&#8217;s own money; nor that it was &#8220;a soft loan&#8221;.  There is no evidence placed before the court to support such a finding.  However, clearly the wife&#8217;s legal team were entitled to ask about the origins of that money, had they known about it.  I regard it as unfair for the husband to complain about what the wife has said in reaction to information that she received after the event, which she should have received before the event (the event, of course, being the parties&#8217; agreement).</p>

Mr Todd says that the wife&#8217;s claim that the husband must have had the funding in place is incorrect. He says that, &#8220;as H impressively explained, these offers are put out and then the cash is gathered. If the cash is not gathered, the deal does not proceed&#8221;.  He points out that, in any event, we know that the financing was not in place because the funding did not come in until much later.  In my judgement this contention of Mr Todd&#8217;s is impossible to sustain.  The fact is that the husband had been in serious negotiations to acquire the new property and had met with funders. The memorandum of sale to which I have already referred was contiguous with the consent order being approved by me. I am not in any doubt that the husband deliberately concealed the possibility of purchasing the new property. Whether or not the funding was in place may indeed go to the husband&#8217;s value and liquidity, that is of course a matter for the re-hearing. The fact is that the wife and her legal team and, indeed, the court, were all entitled to know that the husband had been busy making offers and seeking funding in relation to this property. The fact that the husband chose to withhold information from his lawyers and from the court speaks volumes. He must have known, when he was giving evidence, particularly when giving evidence about his own re-housing, that the information that he chose to conceal was of central importance to the decision that I had to make as the judge.   It is obvious that this information would have been important to the wife and her legal team when they were advising her about the offer which led to eventual settlement. </span></p>

This, and his liquidity, were central to the judicial determination and was central to the understanding of the wife&#8217;s legal team so that they could advise whether or not to accept his offer.

As I have already noted, I might well have gone out of my way to ensure that the husband was able to preserve the company and it seemed to me that the agreement that the parties reached managed, on the one hand, to ensure that the company was retained and, on the other, ensure that the wife had a substantial lump sum and the property that she desired.  I am not saying that the wife will necessarily receive any more in due course when the case is reheard; that is a decision for another time.

But, as I have already said, I do not find it necessary to resolve this issue because the existence of the bid, the funding and the dealings in relation to this property for some weeks prior to the hearing should all have been disclosed to the wife and to the court. It may be that, in reality, what the husband was doing was trying to make a profit from the new property and avoid tax on it by claiming principal private residence relief. In saying that, I am not in any way finding, because it is unnecessary for me to do so, that the husband was behaving inappropriately as regards HMRC.

X had sued in a bid to recover alleged overpaid rent; the business had counter-claimed.  It is unnecessary, for the purposes of this Judgment, for me to go into the complex issues surrounding the litigation. Suffice to say that a dispute had arisen concerning the quantification of the rental payable pursuant to a rent indexation clause contained in the lease. X unilaterally withheld a proportion of the rental payment whilst at the same time starting legal proceedings asserting that agreed indexation mechanisms specified in the lease contravened foreign mandatory law (the main law applicable to the lease). </span></p>

The husband&#8217;s valuer, Mr Lane, had deducted the value of X&#8217;s claim having liaised with those who advise the husband and the business. Mr Lane&#8217;s contention was that if the property were to be valued today [by which, of course, he meant at the time of the original hearing] it would be reasonable to assume that it would be purchased with the purchaser deducting the potential exposure to the overseas litigation from the purchase price. The exposure was &#163;11.3 million. Ms Greade, on behalf of the wife, said that she was reluctant to arrive at a value given the uncertainty surrounding the litigation. The overseas litigation point was, correctly, identified by Mr Todd at the original hearing as being one of the two major valuation issues that divided the accountants. It was very clear to me, as advocated by both sides, that the overseas litigation was of central importance to my computation exercise.</span></p>

Mr Lane had deducted approximately &#163;10 million (i.e., almost all of the &#163;11.3m exposure) from his valuation to reflect the risk. Furthermore, the husband contended that this was only &#8220;part of the story&#8221; because if X were successful in the litigation, there would also be a loss of rent going forward. There would also be less capital expenditure by X and this would mean that the renewal would be at a lower rent. It is self-evident that the combination of a possible capital hit of c&#163;10m, a substantial rent reduction and a reduction in capital expenditure by X would have immense valuation ramifications.</span></p>

He also said, &#8220;if I have a 10% chance of winning the case it could go either way&#8221;.  Making all possible allowances for his dyslexia, I find that the husband, with his successful business life, knows only too well the difference between &#8220;50/50&#8221; and &#8220;a 10% chance&#8221;.  Yes, both &#8220;could go either way&#8221;, but the husband knows that a 50% chance has a far better prospect of going his way than a 10% chance and it does him little credit to suggest otherwise.</p>

Since those proceedings were compromised, the wife&#8217;s legal team discovered that the proceedings were declared closed in late February 2018 and the result was released in early April 2018.   At page E 53 of the bundle is a document dated early November 2019 from a partner at the overseas firm of lawyers.  After giving some brief background about the litigation, it reveals that in mid 2017, the overseas court made a ruling against X finding that the overseas courts did not have jurisdiction to decide the dispute as there was a valid arbitration clause.  The document confirms that X&#8217;s claims were defeated due to lack of jurisdiction. The document then confirms that in early April 2018, the sole arbitrator issued the final award in the arbitration proceedings and found in favour of the business.</p>

First of all, he omitted to tell the court in his evidence that he had received oral advice that the prospects of success were &#8220;50/50&#8221;.

I am afraid that I cannot reconcile the above quoted evidence with the pleading in paragraph 26(iii) of the Points of Defence.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The significant, possibly extravagant, expenditure following the hearing certainly shows that the husband had liquidity and confidence which is inconsistent with his written and oral presentation at the 2018 hearing.  However, there is no doubt that the success in the overseas litigation brought substantial riches and liquidity to the business.  Furthermore, as discussed below, monies were introduced into the DLA in respect of the issue relating to the yacht.  Having found, as I have, that the husband was dishonest in relation to the overseas litigation issue, I am not sure that the schedules of expenditure take me much further than being able to say that the husband had many millions more than he had led the court to believe and that success in the overseas litigation was probably one of the significant reasons for this. The other, of course, was the loans made to him by his brother. I accept the criticism made on behalf of the wife that this expenditure was all taking place at a time when the wife was still waiting for her lump sum which, as set out above, was to be received in stage payments over time.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the husband, Mr Todd and Mr Kenny robustly defend the allegations which are being put.  In my judgement, whilst it is clear that the amount that the husband spent following the hearing was inconsistent with his oral and written evidence, the combined effect of the confidence that flowed from the success of the overseas litigation, the loan from the husband&#8217;s brother and the influx of money that followed in relation to the yacht issue may, to a significant extent, explain the liquidity. My task in this hearing has been to determine whether, as alleged, the husband lied about his resources during the 2018 proceedings. The expenditure is remarkable and reflects an extraordinary confidence on behalf of a husband who had been complaining about absence of liquidity. Moreover, I take the points made on behalf of the wife that all of this expenditure continued whilst she was being kept out of her money. Against that, of course, it was part of the deal that she had to wait for her money and, in any event, she was receiving periodical payments in lieu of receipt of outstanding lump sums.</p>

Complaint is made on behalf of the wife that with the first replies to questionnaire, the husband had produced a copy of his DLA covering the period to March 2018 until 2 March 2019. There is no reference in that schedule to receipt of approximately &#163;3 million from the net proceeds of sale of the yacht in September 2018. In his second replies to the wife&#8217;s questionnaire, the husband had produced a further copy of the DLA covering the period 13 December 2017 to 31 December 2019. On this occasion the credit which did not appear on the first schedule now appeared. When asked in a schedule of deficiencies to explain why the husband was entitled to the proceeds (or part thereof) of the sale of the yacht, the husband replied:</p>

However, Mr Todd is correct in complaining that the matter was not thereafter pleaded. Having heard debate about this on the second day of the 2021 hearing, I gave permission to the wife&#8217;s legal team to produce a pleading in relation to the yacht and Mr Todd and his team then produced points of defence in response.  I have decided, in deference to the complaint made on behalf of the husband, that it would be inappropriate for me to make findings in relation to the yacht issue at this stage. Furthermore, and in any event, it is unnecessary for me to do so given my clear findings in relation to the other issues set out above and my clear decision that the husband has been guilty of misrepresentation such as to justify the setting aside, in its entirety, of the consent order. </p>

Accordingly, it is asserted on behalf of the husband that, as such, no &#8220;cash&#8221; was introduced into the business which the husband could then draw down on.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">The husband admitted that the net value of his personal 10% interest in the LLP was taken as &#163;200,000.  This, he asserts, represented the original sum of money paid by him towards the acquisition of the yacht. It also very approximately coincided with his net value on the basis of the joint accountant&#8217;s valuation of this asset (once costs of sale (but not the borrowing) are deducted).  He asserts that the entire value of the yacht was taken into account in the financial remedy proceedings. The balance of the value, he says, was taken into account as part of the business, which of course formed part of the Court&#8217;s consideration. The Joint Statement of Jason Lane and Kelly Gread put the value of the yacht as &#8220;NAV &#163;2.5 million&#8221;. That was the gross value less the then mortgage and costs of sale. It did not include tax on receipt by the husband.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, says Mr Todd on behalf of the husband, the net asset value of &#163;2.5 million represented the gross value of the yacht less the maritime mortgage but did not include the borrowing in favour of the second limited company. (That borrowing was not deducted as it would otherwise have resulted in a double count when considering the value of the business).  Instead, the value was taken as per the mid-point of the appraisal of the 4 July 2016 which was &#8364;4,550,000 (&#163;3,967,900). If the total borrowing (including that to the second limited company) had been applied against the value of the yacht, says the husband, then the net value would have shown negative equity. Moreover, the husband had provided a personal guarantee in respect of the maritime mortgage, so his potential personal liability was considerably greater than his then 10% interest.</p>

One always has to be extremely careful about conducting an <span style="font-style:italic">ex post facto</span> analysis.  However, what is clear to me is that the events that immediately followed the 2018 proceedings were inconsistent with the evidence that had been presented by the husband in those proceedings and which led the wife to reach the agreement that she did, and which led me to approve that agreement.  In the light of my findings about the husband&#8217;s non-disclosure and dishonesty, that agreement can no longer stand.</p>

I strongly urge them now to engage in a process of disclosure and then negotiation so that they can move forward with their lives rather than being chained any longer with the shackles of litigation.</p>
