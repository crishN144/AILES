This order is the subject of an appeal brought by her father (the Appellant). The order was made on an application by the child&#8217;s guardian in respect of applications by both parents for child arrangement orders (CAO) that the child should have direct contact with her mother (the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent), supervised by the guardian, after a break of almost 2 years following the child&#8217;s abduction to Israel by the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent in late August 2015. This is an unusually fraught and difficult case with a distressing and unhappy history. It is necessary to set that history out in some detail so that the both the order of the court and this appeal can be seen in context.</p>

B had originally lived with the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent after her parents finally separated (having previously separated temporarily within days of the birth) in September 2013 some five months after she was born on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2013.  B spent time with her father but the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent made persistent and unsubstantiated allegations that B had been sexually abused by her father, taking her to be medically examined on numerous occasions. The 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent involved the police and local authority social services. No evidence was found to support the repeated allegations of the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent; the police took no further action and social services concluded in their s47 Children Act (CA )1989 report that there was no role for social services.</p>

Notwithstanding the conclusions of the police and social services, that there was no evidence of abuse, the Appellant offered to have the nanny present during contact and a nurse to change B&#8217;s nappies to avoid further allegations being made.  </p>

The case first came before a district judge on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2014; by this time the Appellant had decided to have a nanny present at all times to avoid further allegations. Nonetheless the case came back before the district judge on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2014 as the Appellant restored the matter as 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent was not complying with the earlier directions of the court.

The 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent would not accept F's proposal that any court order should include a recital that B is safe and happy in her father's care. In July 2014, prior to the trial, the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent emailed the nanny employed by the Appellant to set up a meeting without the Appellant being present so that the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent could impart &#8220;the truth so you can protect B" and denigrating the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent. </p>

On 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2014 the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent, again, took B to a doctor for an intimate physical examination.

A letter from one of the doctors [Dr B] dated 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2014 reported very mild redness and normal behaviour. B had not been with her father since 21st July 2014.  B was referred for blood test. On 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2014, the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent called social services and made allegations of sexual abuse against the Appellant. A social worker contacted Dr B on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2014 and recorded that the doctor did not find anything suspicious on examination and that the doctor&#8217;s concerns were based solely on what she had been told by the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent.  The other doctor [Dr E] emailed social services on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2014 setting out that there had been no objective signs of sexual abuse and that what had been observed were <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a type of lesion that is frequently found in infants, and cannot be a formal argument of sexual abuse...".</span></p>

The judge required that the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent did not take the child for any further intimate examinations except in an emergency. She then started to take B to A &amp; E; it was recorded on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2014 that by that occasion there had been nine previous attendances. The 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent complained of rashes on B; none were recorded. In the meanwhile, the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent continued to take B to the GP with numerous other complaints. The infant child was tested for STD; the results were negative. B, who was now 19 months old, was found to be deficient in iron and not gaining weight because she was not adequately weaned and was still primarily fed on breast milk. The judge later found in her judgment of 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015 that the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent had use breast-feeding as an argument against contact taking place. </p>

She emailed the Health Visitor complaining that B had returned from contact with a strange rash on her vagina.

The trial took place before Her Honour Judge Harris on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015; judgement was given on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February in which the judge concluded that there was no evidence that the Appellant had abused B and that he was able to meet B&#8217;s emotional and physical need. The judge found that the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent was a very manipulative, possessive, over-anxious and over-protective parent who had irrational and distorted perceptions of the Appellant as a father. The judge accepted the professional evidence that the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent was B&#8217;s primary carer and should remain in her mother&#8217;s care. There was PSO forbidding the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent from removing B from the jurisdiction (for anticipated holidays in France) and from taking the child for any medical appointment that was not agreed by both parents. The 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> Respondent was warned that if the contact regime ordered did not take place B could be moved to live with her father. Breast feeding was to cease overnight by September to allow overnight contact to take place.</p>

The judge stayed the order for direct contact until 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August to allow for the application for permission to appeal to go before the High Court.

When viewed as a whole the harm caused to this child by her mother was significant. Not only was she found to have repeatedly subjected to intimate examinations, solely at the behest of her mother, she was prevented from having uninhibited relationship with her father as an infant. On any view, the repeated invasive intimate examination, as found by the judge and set out in her judgment, were in themselves abusive and any long-term effects on B, along with any emotional trauma that may have been at the time, has never been investigated or assessed. </p>

Nor should they consider experimenting or trying out with contact for the child or children concerned against a background of previous harmful behaviour and abduction; in this case the guardian even accepted that contact may prove to be unsuccessful and be terminated or suspended again.
