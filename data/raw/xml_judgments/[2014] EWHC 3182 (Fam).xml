	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 19th August 2014, I heard an application by Kirklees Council for various declarations in relation to a young baby boy, SE, who was desperately ill in hospital.   In essence, Kirklees applied for a declaration that it was not in SE&#8217;s interests to receive further life sustaining treatment.  By the time the case was heard, the Local Authority applied for a further declaration, namely that it was lawful for his treating clinicians to provide him with palliative care only.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">SE had been an inpatient in hospital since he was born prematurely in April 2014.  He had multiple medical difficulties.  He suffered from chronic lung disease (an over inflated left lung and an under inflated right lung).  He had multiple cardiac abnormalities (ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus), right duplex kidney and absent left kidney, Hemi vertebrae, fused ribs and heart failure impacting on his ability to gain weight.  </p>

SE had been transferred to the neo-natal unit at one of their hospitals, Leeds General Infirmary.  Indeed, I heard oral evidence from two of their consultants, namely Dr Hannah Shore, a consultant neonatologist and Dr Philip Chetcuti, a consultant paediatrician.  I also heard oral evidence from a third expert, Dr Martin Ward Platt, who had been instructed jointly by all parties to give an independent further opinion.  The experts were all in agreement that the declarations sought were in the best interests of SE as the treatment he had been receiving was very distressing to him and was ultimately futile as there was no chance of recovery and no purpose to the treatment being continued.  Dr Ward Platt added that he felt there was an element of it being an &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">unbearable situation</span>&#8221; for SE.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Given the importance of the case, I decided to provide a full judgment that would be made public, albeit fully anonymised to protect SE&#8217;s identity.  Nevertheless, the order had been made on 19th August 2014.  The treating clinicians met on the morning of 20th August to discuss the de-escalation of treatment for SE.  It was agreed that he would be taken off his Bi-PAP breathing support that afternoon.  I am told that he was quite agitated whilst still on the breathing support.  The Mother asked for him to be baptised and this happened.  In fact, it appears that the Mother and SA left before the baptism took place.  I assume they found the situation too distressing.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I agree with counsel for Kirklees that it would be quite wrong for a Local Authority to follow this guidance, regardless of whether or not the Local Authority holds an interim care order or a final care order.  If there is parental opposition, parental equivocation or doubt as to parental capacity to decide, an application must be made to the court.  In such circumstances, a Guardian will then be appointed.  I further take the view that, if there is an interim care order and therefore a Guardian already in place, the Guardian should always be involved before such a serious decision is taken.  If the Guardian considers that an application should be made, the Local Authority or the NHS Trust must do so.   </p>

She said that SE was suffering from a degree of heart failure and very serious lung problems.   He needed a procedure to repair what was in effect a hole in his heart.  Unfortunately, his weight was too low to enable the operation to proceed but it was a vicious circle as the problem was impacting on his ability to gain weight.  He was on the verge of requiring re-ventilation.   The doctor considered that he should not be re-ventilated if he required it again.  Equally, chest compressions should not be performed to re-start his heart.  She considered that ongoing treatments would be painful and distressing and would merely prolong his death in circumstances where there was no chance of recovery.  Indeed, even if treated, she considered there was a very high chance he would succumb at some point to a further respiratory infection.  There was, therefore, no purpose to the treatment either.  </p>

He had met SE&#8217;s foster carers who took the view SE had regressed in recent weeks.  They had noted his increasing distress.  On examination of SE, the doctor found a constellation of grave health problems.  He considered the most serious to be neuro-developmental impairment. SE needed cardiac surgery but it was far from certain he would survive long enough to be able to have the surgery.  He considered SE&#8217;s chance of recovery was sufficiently low and the price of striving to keep him alive in terms of pain and distress was sufficiently high for it to be wrong to attempt to do so.  Indeed, he thought it was perhaps cruel to subject him to such treatments.  The doctor agreed that SE fell under the headings of both no chance and no purpose.  Indeed, he felt there might also be an element of the unbearable situation.  There were, he said, two alternatives.  The first was to continue the status quo but with no re-ventilation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  The second was an immediate palliative care pathway with the removal of his current respiratory support.  He favoured the latter.  </p>

Dr Chetcuti said that the position was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">unsustainable&#8221; </span>as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he hates the machines&#8221;.  </span>Dr Ward Platt told me that SE was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;distressed all the way through my examination&#8221; </span>and that it was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">just a case of degree&#8221; </span>with him displaying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a constant demeanour of distress&#8221;.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the issue of future prognosis, Dr Ward Platt said that the outlook was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">very dark indeed&#8221;. </span>There was a continuing pattern of deterioration, even from the time of his examination the previous week.  He considered that the attacks requiring ventilation would come more frequently until he could not be resuscitated.  If the status quo remained as it was, SE would undoubtedly require ventilation again within a short period along with large amounts of sedation.  He would lose the ability to interact with those around him and there would be no exit strategy.  It was a downward spiral. Even if one period of ventilation worked, this would only be a precursor to another subsequent collapse.  It was only a case of how long it took before he died.   The other doctors agreed.   </p>

I accepted that the individual human instinct and the desire to survive is strong.  I assumed it was strong in SE.  He had the support of his devoted foster carers.  At times, he had settled periods.  If I declined the declarations, he might live for a further period.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Regrettably, however, every other consideration pointed strongly the other way.  It was clear that SE had no quality of life.  There was virtually no pleasure, merely pain and suffering.  The burdens of the continuing treatment were, for this little boy, huge.  He was in significant and very regular distress.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It was quite clear that he should not be put through the unpleasant and painful procedure of further ventilation or chest compressions as and when they became necessary, as I was sure they would.  There was no point in doing so.  Any such treatment would merely prolong SE&#8217;s death and, even if initially successful, would inevitably lead in due course to the need for further such treatment.  Eventually, the treatment would not work and he would die, possibly in distress.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It was, by the conclusion of the oral evidence, equally clear that the appropriate way to proceed was to provide SE with palliative care only, provided the measures and treatments adopted were the most compatible with maintaining his comfort and dignity.  I was very impressed by the careful way in which all three doctors approached the matter.  SE has had the very best care but, sadly, it has not been possible to make progress.  Regrettably, there has been significant deterioration in his health rather than improvement.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I accept the evidence of all three doctors.  I had a clear and firm prognosis that further treatment would be futile and would in due course end in his death.  I considered that, very unfortunately, this was a case where there was both &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">no chance</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">no purpose</span>&#8221; in continuing treatment.  So far as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">no chance</span>&#8221; was concerned, the treatment was merely delaying death.  Not only was it not alleviating suffering, it was actually causing distress and pain to SE.  The treatment was neither improving his life quality nor his potential.  It was futile, burdensome and not in his best interests.  </p>

Moreover, the Mother did not want SE to suffer further.  Although only a very young and ill baby, I particularly noted the evidence of Dr Chetcuti that SE himself &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">hated the machines</span>&#8221; and Dr Shore that SE needed to be kept in a darkened room.  </p>

He had a very poor quality of life and would, I concluded, soon have come to the point where he had no breaks from the distress.  </p>

At the very least, he deserved to end his short life with comfort, dignity and no distress.  Fortunately, this was achieved.  </p>
