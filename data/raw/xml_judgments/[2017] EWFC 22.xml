I will however identify his maternal grandmother because it is she that is before the Court today.  She is Alison Moutiq.  The Applicants are Bedford Borough Council with care proceedings concerning the child who is now three years of age.  The child, a boy, has a Children's Guardian; the Local Authority is represented by counsel; the Guardian by her solicitor, and Miss Moutiq, as I will call the grandmother, is represented by Mr Michael Edwards of counsel, who stepped in yesterday at very short notice to advise and represent her.  </span></p>

That Order was served on the grandmother on Sunday morning and because it seemed to the police executing the Order that she did not comply with it she was arrested and brought before the Court yesterday afternoon, that being the earliest opportunity when she could appear with legal representation.  The hearing took place over the course of some two hours or more yesterday afternoon.  It was not completed and now comes back before the Court today, the grandmother having been in custody since Sunday morning.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The Order made last Friday required any person served with it to inform the Tipstaff of the whereabouts of the child and of the place where he resides within England and Wales if they knew it.  That was para. (a).  It also by para. (b) required such persons to inform the Tipstaff of all matters within their knowledge or understanding that might reasonably assist him in locating the child.  At the hearing yesterday I was taken to the evidence filed by the Local Authority through its Social Worker which I will describe in a moment.  None of it was disputed and so the Social Worker was not questioned on it.  The grandmother was advised as to her rights, which include the right to remain silent and not to incriminate herself.  She chose to give evidence and did so.  She was questioned by counsel for the Local Authority and briefly by the Guardian&#8217;s solicitor.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The background is that the child&#8217;s mother, the daughter of the grandmother, is 21 years old; the father is 29 years old.  He is a former serving soldier.  The Local Authority has for a considerable time had concerns about the child&#8217;s welfare because of serious domestic abuse within the household and indeed the grandmother herself has on occasions had cause to notify the authorities about that.  The Local Authority&#8217;s concerns increased because from around August 2016 they were unable to locate the child or his parents.  They made a number of efforts to find the child which were unsuccessful; in particular they were in contact on a number of occasions with the grandmother and with her partner Mr Mark Hobbs, who they rightly believed were closely in touch with the parents and child.  </span></p>

It is a feature of the case that the relationship between the grandmother and the Local Authority is a very poor one because they have been in conflict including through Tribunal proceedings about arrangements for the 18-year old son.</span></p>

She refused to provide information and said that the Social Services were a waste of space before hanging up.  A message was then left expressing concern for the child&#8217;s safety and saying that the Local Authority intended to apply to the Court for an Interim Care Order and a Recovery Order.  The grandmother replied, accusing the Local Authority of harassment, saying that she would not provide any details of the child&#8217;s whereabouts; that she was in regular contact with them and that they were safe and well.  She said that she would rather go to prison than provide her daughter&#8217;s address before again hanging up.</span></p>

The Recovery Order was drawn up in such a way as to miss-spell the grandmother&#8217;s surname Montique rather than Moutiq.  It also gave an address 15 The Treet (Street with the S missing).  That Order was presented by the police to the grandmother later that evening, the police being accompanied by the Social Workers.  The grandmother refused to give any information or to confirm whether 15 The Street was the address.  Subsequent visit to that address established that it was not.</span></p>

However, it alleges that there has been a breach of the obligation to inform the Tipstaff of all matters within the grandmother&#8217;s knowledge or understanding which might reasonably assist in locating the child.  In that, the Local Authority points to the consistent admitted failure to cooperate throughout.  It invites the Court to infer that the grandmother and mother are likely to have planned the detailed escape route; that on Sunday the grandmother referred to Cyprus and only to Ireland when challenged; that the account given in relation to the four phone messages and the switching of the phones and the new phone should be considered; and that the account of a conversation consisting only of &#8216;Get out!&#8217; followed by a scream is implausible. </span></p>

Her stupidity has led directly to the current situation.  If she had played the part of a responsible grandparent this situation would never have arisen.  The Social Workers would have been able to speak to the mother and the father and assessed whether the child was at risk or not, and to form an independent judgment of whether the child was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;exceedingly well.&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">  Instead the grandmother has chosen to put her grandson&#8217;s welfare behind her own selfish and ill-informed views about Social Services.  She would no doubt be the first to complain in any case where Social Services failed to protect a child from harm, and look where we are now &#8211; a three-year old child on the run, a grandmother in prison; all this is the result of Miss Moutiq&#8217;s brazen arrogance, carefully dressed up by her to look like principle.  </span></p>

The Local Authority must establish so that I am sure that the breaches it alleges are made out.  I refer only to the allegation that is pursued.  Miss Moutiq was obliged to inform the Tipstaff of all matters within her knowledge or understanding that might reasonably assist him in locating the child.  For the reasons given by the Local Authority I think that it is very probable that the grandmother knows more than she is telling and that the cloak of candour disguises a fuller story.  I also think that it is more than possible that the grandmother, the daughter and the father put in place a plan to keep the child out of reach if Social Services got too close.  </span></p>

I refer to the decision of the President in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Canberra v Jones</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/2264" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 2264 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 2264 (Fam)</ref> paras. 11-14.  I must be sure what the alleged contemnor was required to do and that it was in her power to do it and that she failed to do it.  The fact that she herself has created the problem is neither here nor there.  In this case I have a high degree of suspicion that the grandmother knows more.  I would even be prepared to say that I think it probable.  But I am not sure of it.  It is possible that she told her daughter to go, being careful not to know where she was going to go.  Accordingly, I dismiss the application for the further committal of Miss Moutiq and I shall in a moment direct her release.  She should consider herself extremely fortunate and the time that she has spent in custody has been richly deserved.  </span></p>
