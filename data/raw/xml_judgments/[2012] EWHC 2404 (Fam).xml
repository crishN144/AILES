	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application has a traditional feel about it since an adoption application in circumstances like these will nowadays usually, but not invariably, have been preceded by a placement order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s21</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>&#8221;). In turn, the placement order will almost invariably have been preceded by a full care order. The placement order was the successor to the freeing order which originated in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/72/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s14</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/72" uk:canonical="1975 c. 72" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1975</ref> and which was replaced by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/72/section/18" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s18</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption Act 1976</ref>.

Authority has held that this is a stringent test. Experience shows that leave is rarely granted and the great majority of adoption applications made following a placement order are heard in the absence of the natural parents by an abbreviated process.</p>

That decision was preceded and succeeded by a number of other rulings both of the Children&#8217;s Hearing and the Glasgow Sheriff Court.</p>

She is a solicitor supremely well qualified in Scottish adoption law. I heard her give oral evidence over a full day. When the case started on 18 June 2012 I was concerned at the prospect of being asked to pronounce on the Convention compliance of Scottish legal processes in this field, and on 22 June, when the case was adjourned part-heard, I invited the Lord Advocate to intervene to make submissions either in writing or orally through counsel. He took up the invitation and instructed Mr Steven Kovats QC who supplied a very clear skeleton argument and made concise submissions when the case resumed on 25 July 2012. I am indebted to both Miss McFadden and Mr Kovats QC for explaining so patiently to me the features of the Scottish system.</p>

The genesis of the Children&#8217;s Hearing is the Report of the Kilbrandon Committee in 1964 the proposals within which were enacted, with some modifications, in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1968/49" uk:canonical="1968 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968</ref>.

The Reporter has a dual role: in addition to giving advice he or she formulates the threshold grounds which must be established before the Sheriff before the case can be referred to the Children&#8217;s Hearing (see para 15 below), and he or she is the Respondent to any appeal from a decision of a Children&#8217;s Hearing to the Sheriff. In contrast to the position in England and Wales the Local Authority is not a party to any such appeal.  One of the objects of the 2011 Act is to separate these roles of the Reporter. </p>

If the advice does not support the decision of the adoption agency to seek adoption then by Reg 23 of the </span>Adoption Agencies (Scotland) Regulations 2009 (No. 154) the agency must within 28 days of notification of the advice review its decision, and if it adheres to its original view it must within 28 days of the date of the Children&#8217;s Hearing seek a permanence order (see para 21 below). But this obligation does not apply if an application for an adoption order has been made. As will be seen, there was a technical breach of this obligation because the adoption application (made in England, and which is before me) was made two months <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">after</span> the advice from the Children&#8217;s Hearing.</p>

For these purposes there will be various reports prepared. If a long term placement is proposed, with a view to adoption, then it is the function of the Hearing to consider the care plan, although there is no corresponding provision to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31</ref>A <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. There is no specific power for the hearing to make a formal declaration approving the care plan although that is the practical effect of making a supervision requirement with conditions which allow the care plan to be implemented. It is lawful, and unsurprising, that the placement may be in England, Wales or Northern Ireland &#8211; see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/36/section/26/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s26(2)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/36" uk:canonical="1995 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1995 Act</ref>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The alternative route by which a child may be placed with foster-carers is under Part 2 of the 2007 Act by means of a Permanence Order. This is an order which extinguishes parental rights and responsibilities and vests them in the local authority. This order has many of the characteristics of a final care order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s31(1)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. Miss McFadden explained to me that this Order (rather than a supervision requirement with conditions) is more often sought where the case involves an older child where long term fostering, but not adoption, is the plan. An application for such an order would be sought in either the Court of Session or a Sheriff&#8217;s Court, and would be heard formally on sworn oral evidence.</p>

It has been suggested that there would have been more expert evidence as to parental capacity by way of, perhaps, psychological and medical evidence, than is before me, but that was mere assertion on behalf of M, and was not accepted by Miss McFadden.

This procedure pre-dates the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>. I have been shown no reported case from Scotland where it has been argued (let alone found) that the procedure of the Children&#8217;s Hearing in making such decisions was non-compliant with Articles 6 and 8 because of their informal nature and because the evidence is perhaps less full and less stringently tested than would be the case south of the border. Miss McFadden informed me that she was aware of unreported cases where this argument had been raised, invariably unsuccessfully. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> challenge in <span style="font-style:italic">Principal Reporter v K</span> was to one specific aspect to the Children&#8217;s Hearing procedure namely the barring of the father, who was not married to the mother and who did not have parental responsibility, from the Hearing. That challenge was successful and the defect is cured by the terms of the 2011 Act. Otherwise there is no suggestion in the joint judgment of Lord Hope and Lady Hale that the nature of the Children&#8217;s Hearing is intrinsically non-complaint with Articles 6 and 8 when making serious long-term decisions. Equally, Miss McFadden was not aware of concerns raised by MSPs during the passage of the 2011 Act that the Children&#8217;s Hearing system was fundamentally defective in Convention terms. </p>

These were formal letters written pursuant to the terms of the Adoption Agencies (Scotland) Regulations 2009. By Reg 16 the adoption agency must, within 7 days of making the decision, provide each parent or guardian of the child with (a) a memorandum in the form set out in Schedule 2; (b) a certificate in the form set out in Schedule 3; and (c) a certificate in the form set out in Schedule 4.  Schedule 4 is the document in which the parent either gives or withholds consent. It is curiously drafted. Miss McFadden says it contains an error as it is identical terms to Schedule 7, which relates to applications for Permanence Orders. Schedule 4 informs a parent withholding consent that if the adoption agency wishes to continue with the plan for adoption then it must make an application for a Permanence Order, which is in fact wrong even if the adoption were to proceed in Scotland, as the law permits an application to proceed without a permanence order by direct petition, and doubly wrong if the child has been placed in England, where we do not have Permanence Orders. It does seem that the information in Schedules 2 and 4 is deficient inasmuch as it only contemplates an adoption in Scotland alone rather than in another part of the country. </p>

While I do not know the date of the Notice of Appeal it must have been before the placement of Z with A. But M sought no stay on the placement. On 24 May 2011 the Reporter wrote to the Sheriff advising him of her view that the panel failed to provide adequate justification for their decision. Since the Reporter is the only Respondent to the appeal it was thus conceded that the appeal should be allowed, and on 3 June 2011 Sheriff Baird, as a formality, duly allowed the appeal, and directed the Hearing to reconsider its decision. But, as Miss McFadden pointed out, the Sheriff was not asked by M, nor did he order, that Z be returned to Scotland to live with JR. </p>

A, who is single, is plainly an eminently suitable person to adopt Z, should that be in her best interests. In my judgment she is a highly motivated, responsible, articulate, caring and insightful person. The confidential report accurately describes her as nurturing, calm, solid and mature. She is in decently paid self-employment and is financially sound. She can balance her occupation with her responsibilities to Z. Her home is a pleasant property and is owned by her, subject to a mortgage.</p>

This was then thoroughly investigated by the Council, and the view was taken then it amounted to nothing more than appropriately sitting Z down when she was naughty and holding her face in order to maintain eye contact when admonishing her, and then sending her to her room as punishment. At all events no action was taken, and the episode was regarded as so inconsequential as not to warrant reference in the formal report to the court, or mention to the Guardian.</p>

In it he explained that he committed fraud because &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t receiving any benefits from the Government&#8221;. In it he complains at his lack of indefinite leave to remain here. He puts himself and his wife forward as carers for Z.  The statement shows a total lack of insight into Z&#8217;s needs. I place little reliance on it given that F failed to attend the second phase of the hearing to give oral evidence.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (Placement orders: Parental Consent) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 2 FLR 652" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 2 FLR 652</ref> the Court of Appeal has stated that the use of the verb &#8220;requires&#8221; has an imperative connotation. Thus the welfare of the child must demand dispensation, rather than it being merely reasonable or desirable. The question is this: is adoption &#8220;required&#8221;? If a measure short of adoption will meet the welfare needs of the child both short and long-term then it cannot be said that adoption is &#8220;required&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It has been observed that with the abolition of capital punishment the decision to make an adoption order, which extinguishes the entire legal relationship between a natural parent and a child and vests all legal rights and duties in the adopter, is one of the most momentous that a court is called on to make.  I do not underestimate the seriousness of my task.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That said, my decision is crystal clear. M and F are total strangers to Z. Their only connection to her is biological. There is no psychological or emotional connection whatsoever. So far as nurture, as opposed to nature, is concerned the upbringing of Z has been entrusted for the first 5 years of Z&#8217;s life to JR and latterly to A. A is her true parent in every sense of the word other than biological. And Z&#8217;s welfare demands that this simple truth is formalised by adoption. Any measure short of adoption is likely to foster in Z&#8217;s mind with her growing maturity the thought that the commitment of both the state and of A to the security of her future is questionable. Above all she needs permanence and normality. In my judgment on the facts of this case that can only be achieved by adoption.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The assault by M on the processes in Scotland which led to her placement in England is completely misguided. Of course all comparisons are odious but I cannot help but venture the observation that a system that embraces informality and eschews the black-letter formality of an adversarial expert-evidence based contest has much to recommend it. I am completely satisfied that at all stages (perhaps too many stages) M&#8217;s Convention rights were faithfully observed by the judicial and other state authorities in Scotland.</p>
