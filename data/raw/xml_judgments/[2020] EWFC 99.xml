Mr Harrison on behalf of the respondent submits that his client&#8217;s own Article 10 rights are engaged and says that transparency is in the public interest given that the applicant was a public figure &#8211; that it is in the public interest for justice to be seen to be done for a (former) elected politician.

There is no norm or presumption in favour of or against publication, albeit in the event a public interest in favour of publication is identified there is a greater likelihood of the balance falling in favour of publication. However, even if a relevant public interest argument is identified that does not automatically lead to publication. In all cases I retain a discretion as to whether to permit publication.

It is suggested that the respondent&#8217;s health might be of wider interest as an example of how legal proceedings involving a party with a disability are conducted. I acknowledge that the respondent&#8217;s disability was a factor that impacted on the exercise of my discretion being a factor to which I was expressly directed to have regard pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25(2)</ref>(e) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.
