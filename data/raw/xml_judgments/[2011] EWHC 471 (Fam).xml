That order provided for the matter to be heard on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2011, there was provision for the further filing of evidence, for the father to have contact with the child in Poland in early January and for the mother to travel to England with the child on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January so that the Guardian could meet with them and the child could see her father prior to the hearing on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January.

Mr Devereux<span style="font-weight:bold"/>was instructed on behalf of the Official Solicitor. He had circulated his skeleton argument in advance. As there was no issue taken on his legal submissions the appointment of the Advocate to the Court was discharged.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">[17] &#8220;&#8230;As to the jurisdiction and role of the court, it seems to me: first, that what the court is not doing is carrying out an appeal process in respect of a decision of a foreign court or anything akin to that.  Secondly, it seems to me that the court is not itself applying Art 13 or a Hague jurisdiction as such.  Rather, it seems to me, that what the court is doing is exercising the jurisdiction it always held under Art 10 which is a welfare jurisdiction and, therefore, it is a welfare approach that has to be applied.  Within that approach applying English law, there is the ability of the court to order a summary return of a child to another jurisdiction.  So it seems to me that the court in exercising its welfare jurisdiction has the power to make a summary order under Art 11(7) in an appropriate case (see by analogy to the decision of the House of Lords in Re J (A Child: Custody Rights Jurisdiction) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2005/40" uk:canonical="[2005] UKHL 40" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] UKHL 40</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 1 AC 80" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 1 AC 80</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 3 WLR 14" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 3 WLR 14</ref> sub nom J (Child Returned Abroad: Convention Rights) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 802" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 802</ref>).  In particular, I would draw attention to para [26] of the speech of Baroness Hale of Richmond in Re J which identifies that summary orders are within the jurisdiction of the court and from para [29] onwards where she deals with the factors to be taken into account by the court in making the choice as to whether or not to order a summary return or to embark upon a welfare inquiry.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">[18] Necessarily, a summary return does not involve a full welfare inquiry or anything approaching it, albeit it that it is applying a welfare test.  In the present context it would, however, inevitably involve an effective rejection or an effective refusal not to follow the decision of the foreign court not to return the child under Art 13, but that is inherent in Art 11(7) itself.  It seems to me that cases could well arise for a variety of reasons in which this court may feel it appropriate to exercise its jurisdiction under Art 11(7) on a summary basis albeit applying a welfare test.  There may, for example, be differences if the refusing court acted under Art 13a rather than 13b.  In that context Art 11(4) may have some relevance. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">[20] So it seems to me, given the existence of the power and jurisdiction to make a summary order and having regard to the history of this case and the lessons that could be learned from it, that as soon as possible after an application under Art 11(7) I issued, there should be directions from the court in which the court should expressly consider the approach that is to be taken to the case, namely: is the case to be determined on a summary basis and/or is there to be a welfare inquiry and, if so, what is to be the extent of that welfare inquiry and, therefore, what directions need to be made in that context?  Also, importantly, at that first directions hearing or as soon as possible thereafter, the issue whether or not the child should be joined and, if so the representation of the child, should be determined.&#8221;  </p>

It is clear that an unlawful removal of the child, following the taking of a unilateral decision by one of the child&#8217;s parents, more often than not deprives the child of the possibility of maintaining on a regular basis a personal relationship and direct contact with the other parent (see Deti&#269;ek, paragraph 56).</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Advocate Bylinski in his letter dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February invites the court to transfer the proceedings to the Polish Court pursuant to Article 15. Although there is no formal application made the court can consider a transfer under Article 15 of the court&#8217;s own motion. I do not consider that such a transfer should be made at this stage as the child&#8217;s immediate connection with Poland has been brought about by the mother&#8217;s wrongful retention of the child there, it would not be a better place to hear the case as the father would have difficulty in participating in a full welfare enquiry there due to his financial circumstances which would not be in the child&#8217;s best interests. This matter can be considered again, if required, at the hearing in April.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Following circulation of the draft judgment Ms Honeyman informed the court that the Guardian is now able to complete her trip to Poland by 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2011. In those circumstances I have reconsidered the date for the child&#8217;s return to this jurisdiction and in the light of the Guardian being able to complete her enquiries in Poland earlier the date for the child&#8217;s return will be 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2011. In addition the court has been able to accommodate a short delay in the commencement of the hearing in April so that it can now start on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April. These adjustments will allow more time for the Guardian to conduct her welfare enquiries in this jurisdiction. </p>
