	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.5in">I make no apology for the length of this judgment.  If there is one thing everyone is agreed on, this litigation needs to come to an end for the sake of A and all the adults involved in it.   To do that needs a robust judgment that is complete as it can be.   I have decided that the history of the litigation needs to be dealt with in some detail to explain how we have got to where we are.   Also the judgment may be helpful to those working with the family and, most particularly, in any life story work done with A.  And it is important for the adults involved who will need to find a strategy to promote A&#8217;s best interests and convert what is now a least worst outcome into something better for her. </p>

	      </authorialNote> from an order made by HHJ Meston QC on 23 February 2018.  HHJ Meston had varied an order for direct contact between A and the mother and B made by consent in March 2017 and replaced it with an order for indirect contact only, coupled with a three year section 91(14) bar.    In particular Cohen J considered that the possibility of what he called identity contact and the differential positions of the mother and B had not been explored.   As HHJ Meston had by then moved courts, Cohen J directed that the matter be re-heard by me.    As Cohen J has subsequently made clear, the re-hearing is not restricted to the question of identity contact.  Both the mother and B seek more regular direct contact with A.   </p>

In such case contact should only be refused where the court is satisfied that there is a serious risk of harm if contact were to be ordered (Re D (Contact : Reasons for Refusal) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1997) 2 FLR 48" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">(1997) 2 FLR 48</ref>).   It is however to be noted that in each of the two cases to which I have just made reference the Court of Appeal upheld a &#8220;no contact&#8221; outcome, with the consequence that these oft quoted statements are in fact obiter.   Further, in Re J, where contact was refused in order to avoid placing the child in a situation of stress as a result of the mother&#8217;s implacable hostility to contact, Balcombe LJ rightly acknowledged that affording paramount consideration to the child&#8217;s welfare may, in some cases, produce an outcome which is seen as &#8220;an injustice&#8221; from the perspective of the excluded parent. </span></p>

The need for the single judge who has charge of the case to establish a 'set strategy for the case' and to stick consistently to that strategy, so that all parties and the judge know what is happening and what the court plainly expects will happen, cannot be understated. If, as part of that strategy, the court makes an express order requiring the parent with care to comply with contact arrangements, and that order is breached then, as part of a consistent strategy, the judge must, in the absence of good reason for any failure, support the order that he or she has made by considering enforcement, either under the enforcement provisions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 11</ref>J-11N or by contempt proceedings.

Such forward thinking should be part of the judge's overall strategy for the case. If a directive contact order is called for, then, on making it, the judge should be clear, at least in his or her own mind, that, upon breach, enforcement may well follow. If, on the facts of the case, enforcement is not to be contemplated, then an alternative judicial strategy not involving a directive court order (and which might in an extreme case include a change of residence or, at the other extreme, dismissing the application for contact) must be developed. The error &#8230; that I have already identified in deciding whether or not to 'attach a penal notice', when now, as a matter of law, all contact orders are to contain a warning notice as to enforcement (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 11</ref>N), is not a minor technical error.    It is an error that, with respect, indicates a misunderstanding of the nature of the task of making a directive contact order in the first place. Under the modern law, the judicial discretion is not whether or not to attach a penal notice, it is whether or not to make the contact order itself.  </span></p>

His view, which the district judge appeared to accept, was that the mother had coached B to make comments about the father, that B was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">selfdestructing</span>&#8221; and this might happen with A too.  While the mother had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">started all this</span>&#8221;, the father had responded in kind, although he had made more effort to be neutral and considerate.

HHJ Meston invited the parties to discuss arrangements for A&#8217;s move to the mother and suggested that the Cafcass manager be asked whether a duty Cafcass officer could assist in those discussions in the absence of the guardian. </p>

These benefits, the guardian considered, did not fully counterbalance the risk of undermining the stability of her placement.   A&#8217;s need was to be safeguarded from harm and for a safe, stable home and carers who could predictably and consistently meet those needs.  The father and stepmother, while not beyond criticism regarding their relationship with the mother and B, had continued to promote relationships and were committed to doing so indirectly.  There was a need to maintain A&#8217;s primary placement over and above the need to maintain contact.   The main concern was destabilising that placement. </p>

He acknowledged that this outcome would in the short-term at least cause A distress, anxiety and further confusion and she would need explanation, support and reassurance.

It would be particularly harmful if new arrangements for contact were put in place only to be suspended once again with further mutual recriminations.  He regarded as certain that, if A moved to live with her mother, the father would carry out his threat to have nothing more to do with A and it was probable that the guardian would make a referral to the local authority.   </p>

He concluded that, whatever the motives of the mother and her supporters, the father was bound to interpret their actions and communications as part of a conspiracy with the mother to question the court&#8217;s decision and to undermine the placement of A with him.  He accepted that the father was at the end of his tether and he was genuinely concerned to do what he considered necessary to protect A, his wife and himself.  The judge also accepted that the father was fully aware of the likely impact on A of ending direct contact for the foreseeable future, something which the father described as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">horrible for her</span>&#8221;, and that the main responsibility for helping A make sense of such a decision and deal with would fall on him and his wife.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.5in">Secondly, no separate consideration had been given to the position of the mother and B.    The father himself accepted there was a difference in their positions and was far more wary of what B might do than what the mother might do.  As the guardian accepted, there was no real evidence that B had actually communicated her allegations to A, but there remained a risk that because B feels strongly that nothing would keep A safe, and there was therefore a continuing risk that B would feel she must tell A so as to protect her.  As to the mother the judge had been more qualified.  While she had not moved on he had noted that did not of itself indicate that she would disrupt A&#8217;s contact or stability by expressing her views. </p>

He might (quite rightly in Cohen J&#8217;s judgement) insist that to be safe such contact would have to be independently supervised.    That would require exploration and consideration as to how that might be managed, who would pay for it, who would undertake it and what facilities Cafcass or a local authority might be able to make available. </p>

They impacted on the father&#8217;s view of contact but that was an emotional rather than a logical connection.  The fact that there had not been any recurrence since the start of June 2017, even though contact continued, was not referred to in the judgment. </p>

The court cannot simply stand by while a party says &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I refuse to engage.  I will not comply with any court orders.  If you force the issue the consequences will be dire.  I demand that you stop the litigation now</span>&#8221;.  Such an attitude may amount to a contempt of court, punishable by fine or imprisonment.  To permit such a response by a party would be to allow a gun to be held to the head of the court.   It would set an extraordinarily dangerous precedent, for it would be a green light to any parent bent on frustrating contact to say simply that they were not going to comply.  It would, in short, undermine the rule of law. </p>

Almost always the question is one of enforcement of the court&#8217;s order against the parent with primary care of the child.  To impose a fine or imprisonment is unlikely to promote the child&#8217;s welfare unless it forces compliance.   It is more likely to create a martyr of the punished parent and stigmatisation of the other as responsible for &#8220;locking up my mum/dad&#8221;.   Often little is achieved. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.5in">There was a general poverty in A&#8217;s narratives in the SSAP, steering clear of imaginative, difficult or lively themes.  She had a tendency to &#8216;neutralise&#8217; emotive themes by frequently showing characters going to sleep or producing very short and abruptly concluded narratives.  Adults were sometimes disengaged from child protagonists in the narratives, being unaware of the child&#8217;s needs at times. More positively, there was little in the way of cruel or violent behaviour by adults.  The child would take over and sort out parental arguments &#8211; suggesting that the adults were incapable of sorting out the problem amongst themselves.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.5in">There was very limited depiction of pleasurable everyday life and affectionate interactions in A&#8217;s narratives, themes which tend to occur more frequently in the narratives of securely attached children, contributing to a low secure construct score.  However, Dr Jefferis suggested caution about this interpretation given the general poverty in A&#8217;s narrative content. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.5in">Elevated defensive and low secure scores placed A on the border of the clinical range rather than firmly within it.  Dr Jefferis thought nonetheless that they indicated a degree of psychological damage.  A&#8217;s scores gave the impression of a child who is constrained in her ability to fully express and explore her emotions and a defensive stance which has most probably developed against the backdrop of complex and troubled family relationships.  Children in such circumstances often partially shut down their emotional functioning as a coping strategy, likely to lead to psychological problems as they get older.  A&#8217;s portrayal of adults as less then fully aware of, and attentive to, the child&#8217;s needs may reflect her experience of the adults in her life being preoccupied about their own concerns, including the conflicts about the proceedings which is likely to have drawn their focus away from A&#8217;s needs.  </p>

She had largely accepted the situation and reached an emotionally stable position regarding contact. There is therefore a concern about the extent to which resumption of direct contact would be unsettling and disruptive for her.    </p>

She fixated on details and needed to know exactly what was planned and what the alternatives would be if plans didn&#8217;t work out.  There would be a significant period of anxiety leading up to contact and upset afterwards.  A was now less troubled by conflict of loyalty and changes in her life and had a more &#8216;normal&#8217; lifestyle.  She valued routine and stability.

Put that this was a contradiction the mother did not accept this, saying,  &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">no, they are different things</span>&#8221;.  She said she would not want A to know about the allegations because she hoped she could be encouraged to see both parents in a positive light.

She thought the police were sympathetic towards her and warned her the father was building a case.  She talked about him contacting authorities (GP, health visitor, school) expressing concern about her suffering postnatal depression (she said while she had some difficulties adjusting to being a young mother, there was no diagnosis of PND).   She said it was the situation rather than any underlying mental health difficulties that made things difficult for her.

Dr Jefferis considered the mother&#8217;s position on this to be unresolved and incoherent giving rise to likely difficulty acting and thinking in a consistent and organised manner in relation to contact.  Dr Jefferis referred to the context of allegations that the mother had coached B to make allegations and shouted at B when she would not discuss the allegations and findings (by District Judge Willis across his two judgments) that she had influenced friends and associates to believe in the allegations,  that she lacked the ability to accept points of view other than </p>

I agreed with Mr Hand there is no right to leading counsel, whether or not authorised under a legal aid certificate.  The right is to representation by competent counsel.   Mr Ward-Prowse is a very experienced counsel, very familiar with the case, and was in my judgement competent to undertake the cross-examination of the witnesses including Dr Jefferis.   He had told me Ms Branigan had prepared notes for crossexamination of Dr Jefferis and I was sure those could be made available to Mr Ward-Prowse to assist him.    I did not consider it realistic to expect that leading counsel could be briefed at such short notice in such a complex case. </p>

Dr Jefferis said, if the coping strategy stays in place, there may be general difficulty in accessing and regulating emotions, perhaps to the point where emotions are so suppressed that there is no functional way around them, coming out as anger or self-destructive behaviour.  If the coping strategy breaks down this may become a lifelong habit and result in depressive breakdown if faced with sufficiently difficult circumstances.    </p>

Dr Jefferis acknowledged it was very difficult.   It is right that a parent should be sensitive but she needs also to be able to say (to herself) she is not sure if B is telling the truth.    Instead the mother holds two parallel beliefs in an unintegrated and unresolved way.   This leads to unpredictable and erratic behaviour and is a problematic position to have.  If she had said she was in real turmoil, that would have been a healthier position.  She was trying to ride two horses but pretending not to. </p>

It is likely A would find out and her school environment is a neutral safe place for her.   The mother should have A&#8217;s school reports.  He wondered whether having photos of her mother and B might stir up unhelpful emotions in A, but thought that was just something that has to be managed. If it was unsettling perhaps it shouldn&#8217;t be continued.  There is no reason why the mother shouldn&#8217;t have photos of A; it helps maintain the link. </p>

While the mother&#8217;s recent statements were appreciated, there was a background of behaviour identified as consistent at least with borderline personality disorder.  Her contradictory beliefs were in that territory.   While he had not assessed the mother for BPD he was confident she has personality problems.  He was worried that the mother&#8217;s behaviour in contact would be unpredictable.  If is difficult to see how contact could be conducted in a straightforward way with both the mother and B believing A is living with a paedophile. </p>

Because Dr Jefferis had been appointed to report on the question of contact, she did not interview the parties for her report, although did meet with the mother and B on 10 January.

The father badly underestimates the challenges he will be presented with in the near future.  It is not enough to say her social media use will be monitored and controlled if necessary.  A may be resentful if her privacy is being compromised.  To suggest the mother blocks A completely lacks insight into how damaging that could be for A.  His evidence that he would not let the mother know if A asks to see her demonstrates both an intention not to allow the mother into A&#8217;s life and lack of insight into her emotional and psychological needs. </p>

It is accepted that the father&#8217;s mental health, and risk of deterioration, particularly in the context of poor physical health presents a risk that cannot sensibly be ignored by the court.  Those risks have to be weighed in the balance with all other checklist factors in reaching a decision which has <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A&#8217;s</span> welfare as the paramount consideration.

Without skilful parenting A is likely to suffer with emotional dysregulation.   Neither Dr Jefferis nor the guardian had met with the father.  The court has at least had the advantage of forming a clearer view of him from his evidence.  Mr Langrish noted the contrast between the medical evidence submitted by the father that he would struggle to concentrate or provide &#8216;adequate testimony&#8217;, and his statement that his mental health was &#8216;rock bottom&#8217;, with his appearance as a remarkably bullish and robust witness.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.5in;text-indent:0.1in">Mr Hand described Dr Jefferis&#8217; report as well reasoned and he held to his case in cross-examination.  The guardian was impressed by the mother&#8217;s evidence and her views towards the mother are somewhat softer than the expert&#8217;s.  The guardian thought the mother would have the ability to make contact childfocused.  She did not have the same confidence about B. </p>

The district judge had found, effectively, that A had suffered from parental alienation at the hands of the mother to the extent that justified a transfer of residence.   Thereafter A became caught in the middle of the continuing litigation.    </p>

His perception, which has some foundation in history (including more recently), is very important.  Even if this is an &#8220;egg shell skull&#8221; case there is good evidence that the father has struggled and is struggling mentally.  There is no suggestion A should be moved from his care.  The risk of further deterioration of his mental health cannot be risked; it would simply be disastrous. </p>

People with personality disorder are, she says, incapable of changing their behaviour.  Both the mother and B have a history of saying one thing to the court and doing another.  She described the illusion of B now suddenly having moved on and developing a more mature understanding as all false for the court. They have heard it all before.

It would be unfair to criticise the guardian without her having an opportunity to respond.  It may be that she took the view, as she was making a recommendation in line with the father and stepmother&#8217;s position, that it was more important to meet with the mother and B to make sure there was nothing in what they had to say that might affect her recommendation. </p>

The previous findings of the court have not been that the mother has knowingly fabricated false allegations in which she had no belief in order to alienate A from her father.  On the contrary two judges have found that she has maintained her belief in the allegations and that is also a conclusion I reach on the evidence now. </p>

It is a reasonable conclusion that this child, as the object of litigation over the last 7 years, has been damaged by parental conflict from both parents.  It is notable that despite that she seems settled and happy (superficially at least) and it should to be forgotten that she spent her formative years, when attachment was laid down, with her mother.  I share the concerns of others that this superficial edifice is fragile and could easily crumble as A comes to ask ever more difficult questions which I do not consider the father or stepmother are equipped to answer satisfactorily.  </p>

He has convinced himself that he cannot cope with ongoing proceedings and he and his wife genuinely believe that to be forced to do so would be deleterious to his mental health state. There is however a degree of manipulation of the court and the court process.    Objectively speaking it seems to me that the father is capable of more engagement than subjectively he believes.   This is demonstrated by his ability to attend court and give evidence much more robustly than anyone anticipated from his state as reported to the court.   His motivation in coming to court was to pursue his application for injunctions against the mother and B (hence his initial prescribed agenda of topics on which he was prepared to be questioned). </p>

The Cafcass Positive CoParenting Programme is careful to distinguish alienation from justifiable rejection (because of the non-resident parent&#8217;s behaviour), alignment with the resident parent and attachment issues.  All of these exist on a spectrum and may overlap.  It is not uncommon to see cases which feature all, or any combination of, justifiable rejection, alignment, attachment and alienation.   It is essential that the court understands, through findings if necessary, what it is dealing with. </p>

If A had been alienated from her father by her mother even at 4 I would have expected greater resistance by her to the transition of her care to the father than appears to have been the case.   And now, although A expresses some ambivalent thoughts about her mother and sister (borne out of suppression of freedom of expression) she is generally positive in her responses to direct contact and says she would like to see them.   Dr Jefferis did not find indications of alienation in A. </p>

Dr Jefferis explains A&#8217;s defensiveness and how she is emotionally closed down.   I have no doubt that she is well aware of the hostility between her parents through bitter experience.  It is unsurprising therefore that she finds it difficult to talk about issues around relationships and contact.    Any positive comment she makes about her &#8216;other family&#8217; is likely, through her eyes, to be seen as betrayal of those she is closest to.    I also suspect, although this has not been canvased in the evidence, that she is well aware that her father is unwell at the moment, mentally and physically, and is anxious about his vulnerability.

The question is whether indirect contact can preserve meaningful relationships or whether that can only be done through some form of direct contact, whether regular contact or less frequent identity contact. </p>

That is to grow up free, so far as possible, from parental conflict.    This does not just mean avoiding tensions that might arise from handovers and possibly emotive direct contact.  It also means all the adults giving her the same positive, emotionally supportive and consistent message that all of them love her and want what is best for her.    If any of the adults convey to A that another adult is not to be trusted, that qualifies the positive message she needs.  It makes her aware of mistrust existing between the adults.   It prevents her having emotional permission to express herself freely about her needs.   It creates the potential for divided loyalties.  This will cause lasting emotional harm. </p>

If A thinks she is going behind her father&#8217;s back and being disloyal that is likely to mean either that she doesn&#8217;t make contact, probably resulting in frustration and resentment, or that she does but behind closed doors, creating feelings of guilt and disloyalty.

HHJ Meston said he was certain the father would walk away.    I am not quite so certain, but I consider the risk of him either suffering a drastic failure of his mental health or simply walking away is very high.   Either way, it is not a risk I can ignore.    While the father&#8217;s medical evidence may be seen as self-serving, deriving largely from what he has told his treating medical practitioners, there is an unchallenged psychiatric diagnosis of adjustment disorder and two attempts on his own life which everyone accepts must be taken seriously. </p>

First, it would be the loss to A of her current primary carers.   That would be a more profound change of circumstances for her that continuation of the loss of relationships with her mother and sister in circumstances where she has adjusted to that change, albeit superficially.   Secondly, loss of her father would not mean automatic restoration the care of her mother.  It is common ground that is not possible, at least at present.  The likelihood is (unless the stepmother assumes sole care of her) that A would end up in foster care, an outcome that nobody considers would be in her interests.  There is also a serious risk that A may come to blame the mother (and perhaps B) for the loss of her father or relationships with him and/or the stepmother. </p>

It is better than nothing as it serves to remind A about her mother and sister but it is no substitute for a direct relationship.  I also accept that indirect contact may be more difficult to maintain and may give rise to more questions than answers as A gets older and more inquisitive and continues to ask ever more difficult questions about why she can&#8217;t see her mother and sister.  </p>

If direct contact is ordered I have little confidence that either the court or the adults would be able to manage the risks.  In this I am in agreement with Dr Jefferis and the guardian.  I find it difficult to see how the court could enforce an order for direct contact when the father threatens to walk away.   And what would be the point of punishment for its own sake rather than to secure compliance? </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.5in;text-indent:0.11in">The risks apply were the direct contact to be frequent or identity contact.   Although the opportunities for tension and anxiety might not arise so often with identity contact, the build-up and let down for the adults around less frequent contact does risk more emotive occasions and, perhaps, heightened monitoring of signs in A that all is not well in the care of her father and stepmother.  And there are added risks of A asking more questions than identity contact answers and re-kindling a need that is unfulfilled by infrequent meetings. </p>

As a result the order for direct contact of March 2017 is varied and the order for indirect contact made by HHJ Meston QC in February 2018 confirmed with the adjustments indicated below. </p>

When I sent this order out in draft I understood that would take us to Spring 2023 and proposed a 3 year order to allow time for any further judicial consideration to be completed if possible before A started a new academic year.    The stepmother pointed out however that, as A is a &#8216;summer baby,&#8217; she will not start senior school until a year later.  Remaining faithful to the guardian&#8217;s logic I will therefore make a 4 year order.   That is, I consider, a necessary and proportionate interference with access to the court (by requiring a filter) to allow A a period to settle at senior school without the additional uncertainty and anxiety of further litigation hanging over her at a point of transition. </p>

That gives an opportunity for the court to consider the application on paper and to refuse leave if it is considered a need for further judicial consideration has not been demonstrated.   If there is an arguable case for leave, an oral hearing can be fixed on notice to the other parties.   If leave is refused on paper, an oral hearing can be requested.   </p>

She questioned whether the work would be proportionate.   I had hoped that the work could be done by the same social worker, Ms Penny, who had already met with A in order to avoid introduction of a new professional.   Ms Preston wondered whether Cafcass would carry greater gravitas in engaging with the parents.   She said if a family assistance order is made directed to the local authority that would give the impetus for the work to be done.   She also indicated that the work might be brokered to the local Adoption Agency who are experienced in life story work.  If there is to be an order everybody agreed it should be for 12 months to allow time for the work to be done. </p>
