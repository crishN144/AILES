	      <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.51in"><span style="font-size:10pt">This case concerns a young woman (S), who is now 33. S has a moderate/severe learning disability, and also suffers from atypical autism and epilepsy. &#8220;Atypical&#8221; in this context means, as I understand it, that she displays some but not all the symptoms of autism. Her epilepsy is controlled by medication. The aetiology of her condition is unclear, but may result from a febrile illness at the age of 19 months. It is, however, common ground that, in the words of Dr C, the consultant psychiatrist instructed by the Official Solicitor to comment on S&#8217;s capacity, her mental impairment</span></p>

	      <p class="p18" style="margin-left:0.51in"><span style="font-size:10pt">S&#8217;s mother died in April 1995, and since that date her father (Mr S, who is now rising 66) has been her sole carer, assisted by a number of support workers mostly arranged privately. However, on 9 November 2002 there was an incident (in which it is alleged Mr S struck S, and to which I shall return) which led to the local authority first instituting adult protection measures and then, after it had taken legal advice, to a without notice application to the court on 20 December 2002. On that day, Johnson J, exercising the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction, made a number of interim declarations rendering it lawful for the local authority (inter alia) (1) to place S in a residential placement for adults with learning disabilities; (2) to prohibit Mr S from removing her from that placement; and (3) to limit contact between S and Mr S to supervised contact. The Official Solicitor was invited to act for S and Mr S was given liberty to apply to vary or discharge the order.</span></p>

This was a temporary placement, albeit one able to accommodate S for the duration of these proceedings. The evidence suggests that S has settled well in this placement.</span></p>

He also laid down a timetable, as a result of which the hearing of the local authority&#8217;s claim began before me on 21 July2003.</span></p>

In essence it seeks a declaration that S lacks the capacity to decide where she should live and who should provide her with care. It seeks consequential declarations that it is lawful, as being in her best interests, for her to reside at accommodation arranged for her by the local authority. It also seeks a declaration that S lacks the capacity to decide whether to have contact with her father, and upon the nature and extent of that contact, together with a consequential direction that it is in her best interests for contact with her father to be agreed with the local authority in accordance with the detailed schedule attached to the order.</span></p>

	      <p class="p27" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.57in"><span style="font-size:10pt">The local authority&#8217;s final plan for S&#8217;s accommodation only crystallised shortly before the start of the hearing on 21 July. It is, however, that she should live in a recently renovated house in the borough, which is designed to accommodate up to 8 mentally impaired individuals of both sexes and from multi-cultural backgrounds (S&#8217;s background is Afro-Caribbean). The property is due to open on 5 August 2003. It is relatively close to Mr S&#8217;s home and the day centre, which S attends on a daily basis, is easily accessible. I was told that interviews are currently being undertaken for staff; but the company which is to run the home is well known to the local authority and successfully operates several other homes in the area. There will be a mixed gender staff group recruited from different ethnic community groups. Three members of staff will be on duty from 7.00am to l0.00pm, and a waking member of staff will be on duty all night. Staffing numbers can be increased if individual residents require higher levels of support. There will be a varied leisure programme, and residents will be encouraged to access activities in the community. Contacts with family and friends will be facilitated as agreed.</span></p>

He subsequently both wrote a short report and gave evidence to me about it. He was entirely satisfied that it would be suitable for S and would meet her needs. That view was endorsed by Dr C. The local authority&#8217;s plan to place S in this setting thus has the support of all the relevant professional witnesses in the case and is endorsed by the Official Solicitor on S&#8217;s behalf.</span></p>

His primary position, accordingly, is that the interim declarations should be discharged, and the proceedings dismissed.</span></p>

Then the judge should enter on each sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making some estimate of the extent of the possibility that the gain or loss might accrue. At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of the certain and possible losses.

I agree that there must be good reason for local authority intervention in a case such as the present. Equally, if there are disputed issues of fact which go to the question of Mr S&#8217;s capacity and suitability to care for S, the court may need to resolve them, if their resolution is necessary to the decision as to what is in S&#8217;s best interests. Findings of fact against Mr S on the two issues identified in paragraph 16 would plainly reflect upon his capacity properly to care for S. But it does not follow, in my judgment, that the proceedings must be dismissed simply because the factual basis upon which the local authority instituted them turns out to be mistaken, or because it cannot be established on the balance of probabilities. What matters (assuming always that mental incapacity is made out) is which outcome will be in S&#8217;s best interests. There will plainly be cases which are very fact specific. There will be others in which the principal concern is the future, and the relative suitability of the plans which each party can put forward for both the short and the long term care of the mentally incapable adult.

Following an incident in which the father had slapped the boy, the local authority removed him to a respite unit. The expert evidence in the case was to the effect that although the father, in the main, had provided a good enough level of physical and emotional care, the father had occasionally found it impossible to cope and would find it increasingly difficult in the future.

Munby J made the declarations sought by the local authority, not only on the basis of the assault or of the risk of future physical wellbeing, but on the much greater risk to the incapacitated adult of avoidable and increasing emotional damage were he to live at home, socially isolated and not afforded the full opportunity to develop his potential.</span></p>

Indeed were the court not to do so in an appropriate case, it would, as it seems to me, be failing in its duties under both the common law and the Convention. After all, to declare that some specified person who is, in the eyes of the court, the most appropriate person to assume responsibility for this aspect of a patient&#8217;s care is also to be clothed with practical decision- making on behalf of the patient, is merely to state explicitly that he has those powers and responsibilities which would in any event be reposed in him by the doctrine of necessity Moreover, some such mechanism is essential if those caring for the incapable are to be allowed to get on with their task without the need for endless reference to the court- something which.. .would serve neither the public interest nor the interests of the mentally incapacitated.</span></p>

Many related to the period surrounding the death of his wife in 1995, and none had been deemed sufficiently serious by the local authority as to merit either discussion with him or any action. Furthermore, the allegation that he had failed to co-operate with the local authority left entirely out of account the occasions when his complaints about the local authority&#8217;s conduct had (eventually and after unacceptable delays) been partially upheld.</span></p>

The period leading up to and following the death of his wife from cancer in 1995 was clearly a profoundly unhappy one, and has continuing reverberations within the family dynamic manifested by the alienation from Mr .S of S&#8217;s sister and brother, MS and JS. But at no point during the period did the local authority think it necessary to intervene as it did in November 2002. I am, accordingly, unimpressed for the most part by these historical complaints and prefer to assess S&#8217;s welfare by reference to the present and the future and the evidence of Dr C and Mr O&#8217;M.</span></p>

I am satisfied that in his attempts to restrain her, and in particular in seizing her flailing arms, Mr S may have given Sister W the impression that he was assaulting S. But I think her mistaken when she says she saw him punch her four to six times in the face with his fist, and she is wrong to put the struggle first, before any attempt to administer the influenza vaccine was made.

He does this, he told me, about twice a day, and he also rubbed it on his leg. He produced two containers, which he invited by SS and KB to smell.

The events of 9 November will not have made the task of rapprochement any easier, but if Mr S can accept that S&#8217;s proposed placement by the local authority is truly in her interests, it seems to me that the stage could be set for co-operation between Mr S and the local authority as to the role he is henceforth to play in S&#8217;s life, and (possibly) a reconciliation between Mr S and MS and JS, perhaps brokered through a Family Conference.</span></p>

MS and JS gave evidence for the local authority. Neither visits their father at home. Both are estranged from him, although both said they would like the rift to be healed. Both believe that he should no longer be caring for S. Once again, no purpose would be served, in my view, by seeking to examine further the origins of that rift.</span></p>

Mr O&#8217;M made it clear that even in none of the allegations made against Mrs S was established, it was, nonetheless, in his opinion in S&#8217;s interests to reside in the accommodation provided by the local authority. That is a viewpoint with which I agree.</span></p>

He had also interviewed all the interested parties. He described S as a very vulnerable young woman who, at the same time, presented with challenging behaviour. She required 24-hour assistance and supervision with her personal care and all activities of daily living. in his view she required an appropriately designed programme of specialist care, to help optimise her quality of life, ensure her safety and to guard against possible exploitation.</span></p>

S needed consistency of care. Furthermore, in his view, Mr S presented to him as wholly focused on his own needs, and preoccupied with his disputes with the local authority and with MS and JS. He did not see this aspect being likely to change and were S to remain in his care, she would be likely to be denied contact with her siblings and her wider family.</span></p>

Such disruption, he thought, could be highly destabilising, resulting in behavioural disturbance and regression. This was to be contrasted with the security and consistency of care afforded by an appropriate specialist placement. He did not think that the effective management of her behaviour, and the consistency of approach required to optimise her social, communication and self-care skills, could be provided at home by Mr S.</span></p>

She was concerned in particular by the fact that Mr S was 65 and suffering from diabetes and hypertension. Time was getting on, she said, and it is likely that he will become frailer. He is one individual, and it is difficult to care for somebody like S with so many needs. If, for example, he had to go into hospital overnight, </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt">it </span><span style="font-size:10pt">was much more difficult for him to organise care. Equally, if he was rendered unable to care, there was really no viable alternative. His sister, Mrs AM was in full time employment, and thus not able to take over S&#8217;s full time care. &#8220;His whole package of care is pivotal on the well-being of one person&#8221;, she said.</span></p>

He will undoubtedly find it increasingly difficult to care for S as he grows older, and he does not really have any practical contingency plan were he to fall ill. Add to this, from S&#8217;s perspective, is the fractured relationship with S&#8217;s brother and sister, which currently makes it impossible for them to come to the house to visit S, and which makes contact with her difficult.</span></p>

The proposed local authority accommodation offers what is, in effect, purpose built accommodation and staffing to meet S&#8217;s needs. Furthermore, it offers for her not only the prospect of more social living amongst people of her own age, but facilities which will enable her father and siblings to visit.</span></p>

And part of its strength, of course, is that it does not exclude Mr S: rather to the contrary, if he could bring himself to accept it, it would enable S to have the benefit of his presence on a regular basis &#8212; including, of course, taking her to church each Sunday &#8212; without the increasing difficulties which he is likely to encounter in catering for her day to day needs.</span></p>

The local authority agrees to consult Mr S, if practicable, about S&#8217;s medical treatment or any changes in the arrangements for her care. There is liberty to apply to vary the order preventing Mr S removing S from hem placement with the local authority on seven days&#8217; notice, and apart from any internal local authority complaints procedures, Mr S will also be able to write to the Official Solicitor if he is seriously anxious about any aspects of S&#8217;s care. Further more the order contains an agreement by the local authority to appoint an independent advocate for S on or before 18 August 2003.

Secondly, however, it seems to me that when a judge of the Family Division exercises the inherent jurisdiction in this way, it is important that the judgment should be a public (albeit anonymised) document. Thus although the hearing was in chambers, I give permission for the judgment to be published, on the usual basis that S, the parties and witnesses in the case are identified only by initials. I do this not because I think the judgment is of any importance to the legal profession, but so that the workings of the Division in this aspect of its work are seen to be open to public comment and criticism.</span></p>
