	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the appeal hearing, the mother sought permission to file a further statement of evidence; I read it on a provisional basis, to assess whether it satisfied the general tests for admissibility of fresh evidence (rule 30.12(2)(b) Family Procedure Rules 2010: &#8216;FPR 2010&#8217;).  It did not, and I therefore did not admit it.  However, what did become clear at the outset of the appeal hearing is that one of the mother&#8217;s complaints about the Judge&#8217;s decision, by which he refused to allow a change of school for M, could not be pursued as there was no longer a place in the school which the mother wished M to attend.  Ground 5 of the Notice of Appeal, to which this issue referred, was therefore withdrawn.</p>

The parties separated for a period in 2018; they reconciled at the start of 2020 but finally separated in September 2020 following the arrest of the mother on a charge of assault upon the father.  M was then 4 years of age.  </p>

As to this, it is notable that although the mother continues to deny this incident, she was convicted in the magistrates court of the assault as alleged by the father (&#167;8(v)), and her conviction was upheld on appeal at the Crown Court.  The mother was also convicted in the magistrates court in relation to the incident at &#167;8(iv) although her conviction in relation to this incident was subsequently overturned on appeal.  At the hearing of the appeal in the Crown Court, which took the form of a re-hearing, the Judge found the father to be &#8220;plausible &#8230; credible and reliable&#8221;, in contrast to the findings in relation to the mother.  Although the mother had asserted before the Crown Court that she was &#8220;terrified&#8221; of the father, the Crown Court Judge concluded that her claim &#8220;appeared to be inconsistent with what we could see of her behaviour&#8221; (which included &#8220;provoking&#8221; the father) in the video recordings of events which had taken place in the family home.</p>

She attended a school which was closer to the father&#8217;s home.  The relevant local authority had been involved with the family in 2020, and at that time had undertaken a &#8216;child in need&#8217; assessment under section 17 CA 1989; the authority did not initiate any child protection procedures, in part it seems because M then moved to another local authority area in which her maternal family lived. There was a further local authority investigation in early 2022.</p>

Indeed, whilst acknowledging the fact that he is a victim of domestic abuse, that father&#8217;s position is that the mother voluntarily undertaking a victim awareness course after her criminal conviction is a positive sign. In light of the nature of the father&#8217;s allegations and the evidence available to the court in respect of the mother&#8217;s conviction and subsequent victim empathy work, it is clear that there is no necessity to determine any of the allegations of behaviour demonstrating a pattern of controlling or coercive behaviour made within his narrative statements or schedule of allegations.</p>

Incidents of alleged sexual abuse may well be relevant to welfare decisions and necessitate specific determination when it is evident that they form part of a pattern of controlling or coercive behaviour which impinges upon the decisions the court must make for a child. Slavish adherence to schedules of allegations is not useful when considering the complex issue of domestic abuse. However, in the present case, the specific allegation of sexual assault which the mother seeks to be determined by the court dates to 2014, before [M]&#8217;s birth. Even when viewed in the context of the other allegations made by the mother, this is not an allegation which can properly be said to have an impact on the welfare issues in this case. The mother&#8217;s further allegations include that she was the victim of a physical assault by the father on 27th September 2020 and that he then proceeded to have her, wrongly, arrested for assaulting him. However, the mother was convicted of assaulting the father on this occasion, and that conviction upheld on appeal, and so there is sufficient material available within the case papers already to ensure that determination of this allegation is unnecessary&#8221;.</p>

Moreover, he found that the mother &#8220;misrepresented the truth&#8221; by implying to M&#8217;s general practitioner that she alone had parental responsibility for M, and that the father did not.

He challenged the proposition that the refusal to marry a woman who has been convicted of an assault against him is an example of his controlling and coercive behaviour towards her.

He drew attention to the adverse findings against the mother in the Crown Court of her lack of credibility, the finding that the mother was deliberately interfering with the father&#8217;s relationship with M in relation to his access to her medical records, and the scurrilous and unfounded suggestion of sexual abuse; he relied on <span style="font-style:italic">K v K</span> [2022] EWCA Civ 468 (&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">K v K</span>&#8217;) and the fact that the duty is on the court only to determine &#8220;those factual matters which are likely to be relevant to deciding whether to make a child arrangements order and, if so, in what terms&#8221; ([67]).</p>

The fundamental decision to hold (or not to hold) a fact-finding hearing is also located (albeit not explicitly) in rule 1.4(2)(c)(i) FPR 2010 which is itself a cornerstone of the FPR 2010, requiring judges to &#8220;[decide] promptly which issues need investigation and hearing and which do not&#8221;.  Thus, in this field as in all others in the Family Court, litigants should expect the issues to be tried to be limited only to those which it is necessary to determine to dispose of the case, and for oral evidence or oral submissions to be cut down only to those which it is necessary for the court to hear (see again the &#8216;Road Ahead&#8217;: June 2020 quoted in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H-N </span>(see above) at [43] and see also [44] / [46] / [47]).

No exploration was sought of the father&#8217;s comment &#8220;it would depend on the circumstances&#8221; (assuming he said this &#8211; I could not locate this in the transcript of the oral evidence, and I could find no challenge to it in the evidence).  Even if he had made the comments alleged, the mother has failed in my judgment to demonstrate that they were &#8216;relevant&#8217; to the judge&#8217;s decision as to whether M should stay overnight on four, or more than four, nights per fortnight with her father at the present time or whether the order should be expressed as a &#8216;joint lives with&#8217; order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Cases involving disputed allegations of domestic abuse are some of the most difficult with which Family Court judges have to grapple. They are particularly difficult at the case management stage(s) because decisions with significant implications for the future conduct of the hearing, and of the family&#8217;s life, are called for; these are acknowledged at the highest level not to be &#8216;straightforward&#8217; decisions (<span style="font-style:italic">Re H-N</span> at [7]).  Judicial continuity is key in domestic abuse cases; judges should always consider retaining a case listed before them which contains allegations of domestic abuse; it is obvious that this case suffered from a lack of judicial continuity, which probably contributed to the lack of consistency of decision-making.</p>

Whilst the court will not hesitate to adjudicate upon parental behaviour where this impacts upon the protection or welfare of a child, it is not for the court to hear about, much less to resolve, issues between the parents relating to their time together, unless to do so is likely to be necessary for, and proportionate to, the resolution of a dispute relating to the protection or welfare of a child&#8221;.</span></p>
