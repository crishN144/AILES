In particular the order foreshadowed proceedings in Dubai by referring in paragraph 6 to applications being made in Dubai. The observations made by Baker J in paragraph 6 of his judgment could not have been clearer and prompted the father to withdraw his application that was before the court. There was evidence that the orders had, in accordance with the terms of the order made on 14 March 2011, been translated and registered with the UAE Embassy, again underpinning the clear intention of the order. In any event, he submitted, the court needs to consider the provisions of Article 12 (3).

There were no position statements or skeleton arguments. It was not clear what the hearing was listed for from the bundle, even though the matter was listed for a day. Following enquires made outside court by my clerk on the morning of the hearing two position statements were given to her, one of them had a 46 page attachment enclosing copies of various authorities. This is a case where the parties were represented by experienced counsel in a privately funded case. When I asked for an explanation as to why the Practice Direction had not been complied with the following was offered:</span></p>
