	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The distributional exercise was equally straightforward. The parties agreed that the matrimonial property should be divided equally. The main dispute in the assessment of the matrimonial property was how much of the business&#8217;s value should be excluded to reflect its foundation some years prior to the start of the parties&#8217; relationship. The dispute was whether that element should be calculated on the linear basis, as contended for by the husband, or on a rather more intuitive basis as contended for by the wife. My decision, reasoned in the paragraphs below, is that 24.5% of the value of the business should be excluded as pre-marital property. I also had to resolve a minor dispute as to whether the value of some properties should be excluded as pre-marital assets. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have said, the case was very straightforward. No case-law was seriously cited to me either as to computation or distribution. The wife&#8217;s evidence lasted one hour. The husband&#8217;s evidence lasted half-a-day. The experts&#8217; evidence lasted half-a-day. Final submissions lasted three-quarters of a day. All in, under two days were spent in court. The case should have been capable of being dealt with quickly and economically. </p>

The court does so in the wider public interest. It is in the public interest that citizens who invoke the rule of law should have true access to justice. A putative litigant does not have true access to justice if it is unaffordable; if it is, to adapt the weary aphorism, only open to all like the Ritz Hotel. Financial remedy litigation seems to be fast heading for Ritz Hotel status - so expensive that it is only accessible by the very rich.</p>

Mr O&#8217;Driscoll did not join the company, and it did not start functioning as a partnership, until Christmas 1999 by which time it had just secured its first two major contracts. Galldris has since been developed into a group of companies which, in addition to a number of dormant companies, comprises: (i) Galldris Services Ltd (which carries on the main trade traceable back to Galldris Construction Ltd); and (ii) two companies under common control supplying to Galldris Services Ltd, namely ODG Plant Hire Ltd (which provides rent of plant and equipment) and 3G Tunnelling Services Ltd (which supplies labour). The experts in this case have agreed that these companies should be valued as one. As such, and unless otherwise stated, in this judgment &#8216;Galldris&#8217; will be used as an umbrella term for the various iterations of the corporate structure since 1998.</p>

If Galldris is unable to service their current clients Tier 1 work requirements, those clients would look to competitors.

These contracts are typically much larger than the contracts entered into by Tier-2 contractors. The revenue of a Tier-2 contractor derives from secondary contracts with the Tier-1 contractor.  Examples would be works by electricians, plumbers, joiners and plasterers. They are one step removed from the original source of the revenue and have to rely on the Tier-1 contractor for payment.</p>

TK expects sales to continue at &#163;l00m with substantial increases in staff costs and a reduced margin as more Tier 1 work is taken on a reduced margin, whilst SIL and GM consider loss making contracts will continue despite the new management. SL considers such an outcome incongruous with the investment in high level and expensive staff and the decision to become a 'blue chip' company. There appears to be no commercial justification for the very high level of investment, if business performance is not expected to improve. Whilst she acknowledges the issues with pricing and inflationary costs, she does not consider these will impact to the same level going forward given the shorter contract lengths being tendered for and the move to more Tier 1 work. </p>

It seems to me that the expert&#8217;s difficulty in resisting the temptation and the blandishments is much increased if he attends the trial for days on end as a member of the litigation team.

I acknowledge that Mr Singleton is a highly proficient, knowledgeable, intelligent, and articulate accountant who has fully immersed himself in the detail of the operation of Galldris. I also acknowledge that for an expert to give his or her oral evidence forthrightly in support of his written opinion is not of itself indicative of partiality. I further acknowledge that some might say that the forceful judicial demands for impartiality are tinged with unworldliness. It seems to me to be not unlikely that subconscious forces may well incline an expert, who is being handsomely paid by one of the parties, to give evidence favourable to that party. Solemn statements have been made for decades about the duty of experts to be impartial, but I have yet to see in a financial remedy case an expert, instructed and paid for by one party, give evidence adverse to that party&#8217;s interests and strongly in favour of the other party&#8217;s. </p>

Sean's strengths were writing up method statements and risk assessments, and formulating tenders. My skills were methodology (i.e. the underpinning and tunnels), sourcing skilled manpower and delivering the projects with quality, and within budget.

Sean had to continue working for his employer, as he couldn't afford not to have a wage. I had made money from my sole trading projects, and could afford not to be paid until the first tranche of money came in from the contracts we secured. I financed and ran Galldris alone for the first 18 months of its existence. Sean only came on-board fulltime at Christmas 1999 (after we had won our first two major contracts).&#8221; </p>

Only by then had Mr O&#8217;Driscoll come on board and the first two major contracts of the company won. Only by then had Galldris taken shape as a partnership reflective of its current state. Prior to January 2000 the husband certainly had by virtue of his work become fully fledged as a constructor. He brought the intangible benefit of that experience to Galldris when it started operating as a partnership. But fledging as a factor influencing the exercise of the court&#8217;s powers has been ruled out by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Webster QC  suggests that the husband could raise &#163;2 million within the next four weeks. This will be achieved through temporarily over-drawing his director&#8217;s loan account. In my judgment the husband could comfortably provide by this means around &#163;3 million. The husband says that he will need three years to pay the balance. In my judgment he does not need longer than two years, although it will be open to him to apply to vary the date of payment of that instalment. </p>

It goes without saying that with &#163;14,237,623 the wife will be able amply to meet her needs and that with &#163;21,219,261 and his earnings the husband will be able to meet all of his. The question of needs did not feature as a material part of either party&#8217;s case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband does not receive a regular monthly salary. Galldris pays him a nominal amount, sufficient to entitle him to a state pension but no more. He meets his daily needs by using his director&#8217;s loan account and by other, not unlawful, means which I do not need to go into. Mr Singleton assesses a reasonable level of remuneration for each of the husband and Mr O&#8217;Driscoll at &#163;420,000 per annum. Ms Longworth posits a lower figure. In this regard I agree with Mr Singleton. Indeed, my impression of the value of the work done by the husband is that a fair reward could well be argued to be higher still. Indeed, it probably will need to be set at a significantly higher figure in order that he can pay the spousal periodical payments which I have ordered.</p>

In my judgment that is a fair headline starting point.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, that figure should be adjusted to reflect the fact that the husband is paying all of the school fees. With 60% of the total assets and the ability to earn, as I have found, even more than &#163;420,000 per annum it is right that the great majority of the school fees should be payable by him. The school fees presently come to &#163;47,721. In my judgment a reasonable contribution to the school fees to be made by the wife (to be deducted from the headline child support liability of &#163;46,000) is &#163;10,000, leaving &#163;36,000 to be paid or &#163;12,000 per annum per child. That is to be paid at the rate of &#163;3,000 per month, with the first payment to be made along with the spousal maintenance on 1 July 2022.</p>
