They relate to the ongoing arrangements for the children&#8217;s care and for specific issue orders.  The respondent is the children&#8217;s mother.  The children&#8217;s parents were never legally married to one another although they went through a ceremony of Islamic marriage in January 2009.  They were in a relationship for approximately five years during the course of which their two sons were born.  The relationship broke down in circumstances to which I shall come in July 2012.  They have not lived together since.  The father has not formed another relationship.  The mother has a new partner who is the father of their child, a daughter, C, who is now 2 years old.</span></p>

I intend no disrespect to either and do so purely for the purposes of protecting their, and their children&#8217;s, anonymity.  The father has been represented by Mr Rupert Chapman of Counsel and the mother by Miss Katherine Dunseath of Counsel.  The children were joined as parties to the litigation in October 2014.  Their Guardian, MS, was represented by Miss Ellen Saunders of Counsel.  I should express my gratitude for the full and careful written and oral submissions which I received from all three counsel in what was a difficult and sensitive case which I heard in the Exeter Family Court over the course of four days at the end of last year.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The father is now 36 years old.  He was born in Algeria and now has dual Algerian and British nationality.  He is a devout Muslim and, despite what he acknowledges to be lapses in his religious observance in the past, is committed to the principle of ensuring that, as part of their dual heritage, his two sons grow up as Muslims observing all the tenets and practices of that religion.  He has been living in England since 2001 having arrived in this country from Algiers via Marseilles<span style="font-style:italic"/>using false travel documents.  With the assistance of friends, he had obtained a stolen identity card on which he superimposed his own photograph.  Using that false travel document, he travelled to London via the Eurostar rail service.  His immigration status was subsequently formalised when he applied for, and was granted, a British passport.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The mother is now 34 years old.  She had grown up in Devon before qualifying professionally at which point she moved to London.  These parents met in 2006. A relationship between them was to develop and they began to cohabit at an address in North London.  L was born in 2009 and B in 2011.  Prior to L&#8217;s birth, the mother had indicated a willingness to convert to the Muslim faith.  She received instruction at a central London mosque.  The father&#8217;s case is that she willingly embraced his faith without any pressure or coercion on his part.  She chose a new Muslim name and together this couple had several discussions about their future and what it would hold.   The father&#8217;s parents are now retired and live in Algiers; he has two married sisters who live in the United Arab Emirates and Turkey respectively.  By all accounts he is very close to his mother and his wider family ties are, and remain, strong.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At the beginning of 2009, before their children were born, the parties went through an Islamic ceremony of marriage.  It was not a valid marriage since the father remains married to a French woman who has played no further part in his life.  There is a suggestion in the papers that this was little more than a marriage of convenience which secured his immigration status.  I heard no evidence about that and, since it has no bearing on the issues which I have to decide, I do not need to make any findings.  Be that as it may, it is clear from the evidence I have read that, by the time the children were born, this couple regarded their relationship as a committed one, albeit that there were already tensions within their family home.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In 2011, following L&#8217;s birth they travelled with the two children to Algeria to visit the father&#8217;s parents.   The father discussed quite openly with the mother his plans to return to live in Algeria and bring up the children in the Muslim faith in that country.  The parties&#8217; written statements make reference to enquiries having been made at that stage about schools and possible employment opportunities for the mother at the British Embassy.  Her relationship with the father&#8217;s mother does not appear to have been entirely harmonious.  These two women came from very different cultural backgrounds and the mother describes being made to spend many hours a day cleaning the family home under the instruction of this lady.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">During this initial trip, there was some discussion about the possibility of circumcising the boys.  The father&#8217;s case is that the mother was wholly committed to the principle of their children being brought up in the Muslim faith and had agreed that, as Muslim boys, they should be circumcised as babies.  When they took this trip to Algeria, L was not yet two years old and his younger brother was about three months old.  In the father&#8217;s Muslim culture it is customary following the circumcision ceremony for the family to celebrate with friends.  Because there was insufficient time to make these arrangements on that trip, nothing happened in relation to the children&#8217;s circumcision and the family returned to London.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">By this stage, the relationship between the parties had deteriorated significantly.  The mother describes the father as an increasingly controlling and violent individual who sought to impose restrictions on how she lived her life.  She returned to full-time work after the birth of the children.  I accept that during this period the father was playing a full role in terms of child care, a role which he appears to have discharged with some assistance from his Muslim friends and a child minder.  It was a period during which, as I accept, he became increasingly close to the children and they to him.  I have no doubt that the mother was an essential and much- loved part of the family dynamic but there does not appear to be an issue between the parties over the fact that she was working hard away from the home in order to provide for them financially.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Over the next twelve months their relationship spiralled into steep decline.  The father was at this stage a regular cannabis user.  The mother alleges that he would fly into jealous rages and criticise her choice of dress and the friends with whom she socialised.  There were allegations of increasing domestic violence.  In February 2012, the father assaulted the mother on two occasions.  There was a further assault towards the end of July 2012 which prompted the mother to flee the North London flat which they shared.  She returned to the West Country and moved into a rented home at an address unknown to the father.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The litigation relating to these two small boys began on 22 July 2012 when, having consulted specialist London solicitors, the mother issued wardship proceedings in the Family Division of the High Court.    She sought protective orders which prevented the father from attempting to remove the children from her care.  Because she alleged that he was a flight risk, she sought and obtained a passport order preventing him from travelling abroad.   At a without notice hearing on 23 July 2012, Moylan J made the raft of orders which the mother was seeking.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">A fact-finding hearing was listed before His Honour Judge Hayward Smith QC sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court.  Over the course of five days, the judge heard evidence from both parties and made a number of findings.  These are recorded in a document called <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Composite Schedule of Findings&#8217;</span> which has been included in the bundle of material which was before me.<span style="font-style:italic"/>The agreed findings reflect an escalating pattern of threatening behaviour, verbal harassment and outbursts of violent temper on the part of the father.  One of the agreed findings was an acceptance by both parties that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;some of the physical and emotional abuse has taken place in the presence of the children&#8221;</span>.  The police had been called to the home on more than one occasion.  The father was charged with assault following the incident on 7 February 2012, an offence to which he subsequently pleaded guilty.  The children witnessed this incident notwithstanding that it happened at 2am in the middle of the night.  He was to plead guilty to criminal charges raised as a result of the second incident on 21 July 2012 which had prompted the mother to leave the home they shared taking the children with her to a place of safety.  The agreed findings record the breaches of the father&#8217;s bail conditions.  The mother had obtained a restraining order which prevented any attempt by him to communicate with her.  That order, too, was breached.<span style="font-style:italic"/>The father accepted that he had entered the United Kingdom using false documents and that he had subsequently been convicted of theft after obtaining a bank card which was not his and which he used to obtain travel cards.  He accepted, too, that he had been regularly using cannabis since the age of thirteen and had tested positive for cannabis use as late as July 2012.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;At one point, before the children were born, I thought I could move to live in Algeria, but after the children were born I realised that the infrastructure and the mentality of the people there meant that it wasn&#8217;t a proper place to bring up the children.  The father talked about going to Algeria.  He said that I didn&#8217;t seem happy about going to live in Algeria.  I told him I didn&#8217;t think there was anything for the children in Algeria, but he made it clear that if I didn&#8217;t go he&#8217;d take them anyway, and he would say, &#8216;They&#8217;re my children.  If I want to take them, I will.  My parents are in Algeria. He said, &#8216;My parents come first&#8217;.  He said, &#8216;It&#8217;s my mother before everything, and that includes the children&#8217;, and I felt that he left me with no option but going to Algeria, and he smirked at me and looked straight at me and said, &#8216;You&#8217;re trapped, then, aren&#8217;t you?&#8217;  That was the first time I realised he knew I was trapped in the relationship.&#8221;  <span style="font-weight:bold">[C:52]</span></p>

A piece of paper is not enough to stop him.  Even if I had all the orders in the world, he could still do it.  There&#8217;s no golden bullet that would protect the children.  When the time comes, he&#8217;d feel entirely justified in taking the children to Algeria.  As the children become older, if the children express views incompatible with his, and if his parents became ill and say they want to see the children, he&#8217;d act impulsively and rashly and take the children and justify it to himself on the basis that he&#8217;d tell himself that he&#8217;d done the right thing by the children.&#8221;  <span style="font-weight:bold">[C:54]</span></p>

By the order which flowed from his judgment, he made declarations to the effect that each of the children was habitually resident in the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  He directed that the children should live with their mother.  Whilst they would cease to be wards of court, there was a further declaration to the effect that the English court retained jurisdiction in relation to any matters affecting the children&#8217;s welfare.  The father was prohibited from removing the children from the mother&#8217;s care and he became the subject of a widely drawn non-molestation order.  Contact between the father and the children was to be supervised albeit that permission was given for the contact to take place in the father&#8217;s London home for up to two hours at a time on a weekly or fortnightly basis.  The father was required to submit to drug-testing in respect of his cannabis use.  The Cafcass High Court team was invited to prepare a section 7 report in relation to the issue of contact and the matter would come back for further review in August 2013.</span></p>

He was thought to pose a medium risk of serious harm to his two sons who were present when the offences took place and again the nature of the harm was said to be emotional and psychological.  The risk of harm was thought to have decreased as the victim had relocated and no longer wanted to be in a relationship with [him], but there was a worrying comment as follows &#8220;the risk may increase if [the father] is to find out the location of the victim and his children or to start a new relationship with another partner.

For example, whilst he felt he may have been controlling in the relationship he excused this behaviour by stating that it was his nature, he came from a different culture and as the man in the house, as it were, he simply wanted to know his partner&#8217;s whereabouts as he was concerned about her safety.  Regarding possible abuse in the relationship he admitted to slamming doors and punching walls, but also seemed to excuse his behaviour by telling me that &#8220;anything I don&#8217;t like I say&#8221;.  There seemed to be very strong views about the relative roles of men and women within a relationship&#8230;&#8221;</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;There did seem to be a very controlling aspect to his behaviour, he had problems with his temper and he is a man who shows a great deal of emotion.  I do not think this constitutes a mental illness; he is not, for example, suffering from a clinical depression, but I suspect the controlling aspects to his personality are still present.  Although he had attended between eighteen and twenty-one sessions of a domestic violence course which he described as useful the comments which he made about the benefits of this course sounded more like reports of professionals, they were like catch phrases and it remains unclear whether he has been able to put this theoretical knowledge into practice.&#8221;</p>

His Honour Judge Tyzack QC made an order for contact going forward to be unsupervised on the basis of the father&#8217;s undertaking not to remove the children from their mother&#8217;s care.  The period of contact was extended to a full day with effect from mid-February 2014.  At a further hearing on 1 April 2014, that progress was built upon and contact was extended to include overnight stays on the basis that the father was permitted to enter the village where the mother was then living for the purposes of collecting or returning the children from or to nursery or school through a childminder.  A schedule of alternate weekend contact with alternate midweek &#8220;teatime contact&#8221; was put in place with a further review scheduled for July 2014.</p>

Formal applications were issued in respect of these matters on 18 and 28 July 2014.  Directions were given on 27 October 2014 to include the instruction of experts.  On 12 December 2014 the children were joined as parties to the proceedings with MS appointed as their Guardian.  Orders were made regulating the development of contact between the children and the father on an ongoing basis.  At the beginning of February 2015, the applications were transferred to the High Court to be heard by a judge of the Family Division.  There had by this stage been a delay in the instruction of the proposed experts because of funding issues.  The matter had been listed for final hearing in July 2015 but all parties agreed that the two days which had been allocated for the case were insufficient.  Instead, Baker J dealt with final directions for this hearing.  His order of 6 July 2015 provided not only for the listing of this hearing before me but also for the reception of the evidence from the four expert witnesses from whom I have heard.</p>

In particular, he wishes to be allowed to take the children to non-Hague Convention countries such as Algeria and the United Arab Emirates for the purposes of visits to his family members.  He proposes a short break to Paris to visit family members with a longer summer holiday in Algeria for ten days from 24 July 2016.  Thereafter he envisages that travel to Algeria will be a regular part of the children&#8217;s routine as they start to know and understand more about that aspect of their dual heritage and as they become integrated into his family&#8217;s Algerian way of life.  In this way, he intends that they should benefit from knowing both sides of their extended families and cultures.  He offers a formal undertaking to the court to return the children at the end of each such period of contact and, in addition, will submit to whatever legal procedures can be put in place in the countries of their intended travel whether under local Sharia law or other domestic law.  These mechanisms or procedures were the subject of much of the expert evidence which I heard and I shall address them in due course.  His sister has offered to put in place a bond of &#163;50,000 which will provide the mother with a &#8220;fighting fund&#8221; should he default in his obligation to return the children to this jurisdiction.</p>

However, she says that the recent development of contact has taken place at a pace which has left the children, particularly B, unsettled and &#8220;clingy&#8221;.  There have been a number of major changes in the children&#8217;s lives and they need a period of calm and stability in order to settle in their (still new) school routines.  She does not set her face against extending contact in the future but asks me not to be prescriptive at this stage but to allow matters to develop at their own pace.  That position inevitably involves a consideration of whether she is indeed committed to such a development in the children&#8217;s lives or whether staged orders are required or appropriate in this case.  It is certainly not in the children&#8217;s interests to continue to be at the centre of this long-running litigation for any longer than may be necessary to ensure their continuing physical and emotional wellbeing.</p>

In relation to foreign travel, and regardless of whether his intended destination is a Hague Convention or non-Hague Convention state, she perceives the risks of a wrongful retention by the father as too great to countenance.  She does not believe that there are any protective measures which could be put in place by the court which would adequately ensure the swift return of the children to this jurisdiction in the event that the father failed to comply with his obligation to return them.  She advances her case on the basis that he has been willing to comply with court orders to date because his conduct has been under judicial scrutiny throughout the course of this litigation.  Without that scrutiny, she does not believe that he will be able to resist the urge to do whatever has to be done to ensure that the children are brought up as devout Muslims in Algeria.  That has always been his intention and she believes that the ties which bind him to England are tenuous and would be easily broken if, for example, his parents&#8217; health were to fail and/or in circumstances where he was refused permission to circumcise the children.  In these circumstances, she believes he would put his religious duties and obligations above the needs of the children and retain them in Algeria to be brought up in a Muslim household with his own family. </p>

Direct communication between the parents is non-existent save for emails and notes made in the contact book which travels backwards and forwards with the children.  Handovers are overseen by their nanny.  For these reasons the Guardian views a shared care arrangement as one which would place increased pressure on these children who are already showing signs of compartmentalising the lives they lead in their respective parents&#8217; homes.</p>

There is broad consensus amongst the advocates in the case as to the legal landscape into which I am treading.  Whilst the application regarding the arrangements for the division of the children&#8217;s time is familiar territory for any family judge, the aspects of the law raised by the specific issue applications require some consideration of the developing jurisprudence in relation to travel abroad to non-Convention countries and the circumstances in which circumcision, absent the consent of both parents, is likely to be approved by the court.</p>

Where (as in most cases) there is some risk of abduction and an obvious detriment to the child if that risk were to materialise, the court has to be positively satisfied that the advantages to the child of her visiting that country outweigh the risks to her welfare which the visit will entail.  This will therefore routinely involve the court in investigating what safeguards can be out in place to minimise the risk of retention and to secure the child&#8217;s return if that transpires.  Those safeguards should be capable of having a real and tangible effect in the jurisdiction in which they are to operate and be capable of being easily accessed by the UK-based parent.

If in doubt the court should err on the side of caution and refuse to make the order.  If the judge decides to proceed in the absence of expert evidence, then very clear reasons are required to justify such a course.&#8221;</p>

In the present case, His Honour Judge Oliver, having rightly concluded (at paras [39] and [40]) that the magnitude of the consequences of a breach were &#8216;great&#8217; or &#8216;huge&#8217;, did not return to that crucial element in his subsequent analysis on 18 April (from para [69] onwards) where the safeguards are evaluated in the context only of ameliorating the risk of a breach occurring (&#8216;not that great&#8217;) but not in the context of the consequences (described by Ms Okine as catastrophic) that would flow for the child if a breach were to occur.  Most notably, however, the magnitude of the consequences of a breach was not referred to at all when the judge considered the matter &#8216;afresh&#8217; on 1 August.</p>

Not only was that inconsistent with his view expressed in April that some security was necessary, it was also (as in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K (Removal from Jurisdiction: Practice)</span>) an inadequate basis for granting permission to remove given the gravity of the consequences for the child if she is not returned.  If the highly adverse consequences for the child of a breach had been kept in focus, as they should have been alongside the risk of breach and the available safeguards, the judge would have been bound to conclude that those consequences far outweigh any possible benefits to the child from the holiday and do not justify the making of the order absent security for her return,&#8221;</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">In Islamic law, responsibility for ensuring that a male child is circumcised lies with the father, and Islam does not consider that it is a decision for the child to make himself.  The decision when to circumcise is also made by the father, and the evidence is that Muslim practice varies from locality to locality. According to Dr Hinchcliffe, some jurists assert that the father must ensure that the child is circumcised before puberty, whilst others state more precisely that the child should be circumcised on the seventh day after birth.  The father himself was circumcised in Turkey when he was 6 or 7.</p>

He is not going to mix in Muslim circles, and his main contact with Muslims and the Muslim ethos will be his contact with his father.  J is therefore not going to grow up in an environment in which circumcision is a part of family life; or in which circumcision will be in conformity with the religion practised by his primary carer; or in which his peers have all been circumcised and for him not to be would render him either unusual or an outsider.  To the contrary, circumcision in the circles in which J is likely to move will be the exception rather than the rule.</p>

It is likely to be painful and carries with it small but definable physical and psychological risks.  For it to be ordered there would have to be clear benefits to J which would demonstrate that circumcision was in his interests notwithstanding the risks.  The principal benefits put forward are J&#8217;s identification as a Muslim and the strengthening of his bond with his father.  The strength of each is substantially weakened, in my judgment, by the facts of J&#8217;s lifestyle and his likely upbringing.  As I have already made clear, he is not going to be brought up as a Muslim child, and the strength of his bond with his father &#8211; viewed from his perspective rather than the father&#8217;s &#8211; is unlikely to be weakened if he is not circumcised unless his father chooses to allow the absence of circumcision to work to weaken it.</p>

It is a strong thing to impose a medically unnecessary surgical intervention on a residential parent who is opposed to it.  In my judgment, this should only be done if the evidence shows that J&#8217;s welfare requires him to be circumcised.

That case concerned two children (a girl of 3 and a boy of 4) who were born to Muslim parents.  The President was dealing with the case in the context of a fact-finding hearing in care proceedings initiated by a local authority which was concerned that the girl might have been subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) in one form or another.  In his review of the law in the context of whether or not FGM amounted to &#8216;significant harm&#8217; for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, his Lordship dealt with circumcision as a parallel topic.

Many are performed for religious reasons (as in Judaism and Islam).  However, large numbers of circumcisions are performed for reasons which, as the particular prevalence of the practice in, for example, the English-speaking world and the non-Muslim Africa suggests, are much to do with social, societal, cultural, customary or conventional reasons as with anything else, and this notwithstanding the justifications sometimes put forward, that circumcision of the male is hygienic or has prophylactic benefits, for example, the belief that it reduces the incidence of penile cancer in the male, the incidence of cervical cancer in female partners and the incidence of HIV transmission.</p>

Society and the law, including family law, are prepared to tolerate non-therapeutic male circumcision performed for religious or even for purely cultural or conventional reasons, while no longer being willing to tolerate FGM in any of its forms.  There are, after all, at least two important distinctions between the two.  FGM has no basis in any religion; male circumcision is often performed for religious reasons.  FGM has no medical justification and confers no health benefits; male circumcision is seen by some (although opinions are divided) as providing hygienic or prophylactic benefits.  Be that as it may, &#8216;reasonable&#8217; parenting is treated as permitting male circumcision.&#8221;</p>

Whilst he had known of cases where this had been done, in none had the parent visiting the jurisdiction on a temporary basis failed to return the child or children at the end of the temporary stay.  In this sense, it was what he described as &#8220;a self-defining ordinance&#8221;.

This fact alone would be viewed as a significant contra-indicator in terms of upholding any agreement which the parents had reached as between themselves.  He told me that it would undoubtedly go against her in the local courts in terms of her fitness as a mother.  He could not rule out the possibility that she might be arrested for apostasy in the event that she were to travel to Algeria to seek the return of the boys. In answer to specific questions put on behalf of the Guardian, Mr Edge accepted that if the local Algerian courts became aware that the children would be returned to a household where they would not be brought up as practising Muslims, they would be unlikely to uphold any agreement which the parents had made without an in depth enquiry into the merits of the case.  Further, he did not believe that any Algerian court would be prepared to &#8220;rubber stamp&#8221; a parental agreement reflecting an English court order in circumstances where the court had refused to permit the children to be circumcised.  That factor alone would be a serious cause of concern to an Algerian judge.  Indeed, he accepted that he had very little experience of cases where parents were not in agreement that their children should be brought up to receive a Muslim cultural education.</p>

Mr Edge had experience of such cases which took many years to reach a final conclusion.  The expense of pursuing such proceedings might run into tens of thousands of pounds.  In relation to the provision of a bond as a form of &#8220;fighting fund&#8221; for the mother, he had experience of such situations where a charge was secured on an English property for these purposes.  He accepted that, in circumstances where the father was in part-time employment (as here) and in receipt of public funding for this litigation, he was unlikely to be in a position to provide this mother with an adequate remedy in this respect.  Of course, here I have evidence from the father&#8217;s sister that she is in a financial position to assist to the extent of a &#163;50,000 bond.  I shall need to come back to the sufficiency of this offer as a real and tangible safeguard in due course.</p>

The Islamic basis for circumcision is the words of the Prophet Muhammad who described the procedure as &#8220;recommended practice&#8221;, or <span style="font-style:italic">sunna</span>.  It is also an essential aspect of cleanliness in relation to the five daily prayers.  His report refers to the fact that there are different legal opinions as to the age at which circumcision should be undertaken but there is a consensus that it must have happened by the time a male child reaches the age of 10 because that is the age at which they he is obliged to perform prayers (<span style="font-style:italic">sal&#227;t</span>).  Further, circumcision is seen as part of a Muslim&#8217;s identity.  Without undergoing the procedure a boy would not be considered to be a true Muslim.  It is regarded as an essential part of Islamic religious tradition.  In Professor Haleem&#8217;s view, a Muslim child&#8217;s relatives would find it shocking if a family member had not undergone circumcision.  In this sense, both the religious and social implications for an uncircumcised Muslim child are important factors. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">He was asked a number of questions about the timing of the procedure.  He explained that circumcision must be performed by the time a Muslim boy &#8220;came of age&#8221;.  That was generally assumed to be by the time he reached 10 years because this was the point at which he entered into a contractual relationship with God (Allah) and participated in daily prayers with adult Muslim males.  He acknowledged that an uncircumcised boy would still be able to enter a mosque and pray since he was unlikely to be asked whether or not he was circumcised.  However, he told me that a Muslim father is under a religious duty to ensure every male child born to him did undergo the procedure.  He spoke about the social prejudice which a child would be likely to suffer if it became known that he had not been circumcised by the age of 10 and probably sooner.  Given the ages of these children, he believed they should be circumcised as soon as possible and could see no reason to delay.  A Muslim would be likely to say, &#8220;Why create potential difficulties for these children?  What is the harm of having this done ?  Why is there all this fuss?&#8221;.  It seems to me that those rhetorical questions which he posed demonstrate the extent to which circumcision is seen as an ordinary incidence of being a Muslim (as Professor Haleem told me he was) but they do not address the social and family situation of a child where only one parent is a practising member of the Muslim faith.</p>

Circumcision would remove the perhaps 2% lifetime risk of needing a circumcision for foreskin problems, and could reduce their risks of HIV or other STI&#8217;s were they as adults to engage in high risk sexual practice or unprotected sex in HIV endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa (circumcision as a young adult prior to engaging in sexual activity would also be protective).  Circumcision would have a significant risk of mild to moderate post-operative surgical complications such as bleeding, tiny risks of severe surgical complications such as major bleeding or glans damage, and small risks of cosmetic or functional problems needing to be addressed in adulthood.  There is also the issue of patients who feel unhappy or disenfranchised as adults and while the risk may be small and as hard to qualify it is nonetheless present.&#8221;</p>

In general, about five per cent of boys will suffer a significant complication after circumcision with about one in fifty needing emergency treatment for bleeding.  He told me that by &#8220;significant&#8221; he meant anything over and above mild pain.  At the extreme end of the spectrum (albeit rare) are major complications such as glans amputation, penile necrosis and death.  Whilst deaths are very rare, they occur in Europe &#8220;every year&#8221;.  He has personally treated five boys who have suffered partial or complete amputation of the glans with the Plastibell device, a form of circumcision which he would never recommend.  Where they occur, these major complications require complex multiple plastic surgical operations with often unsatisfactory outcomes.  </p>

In relation to phimosis, his clinical experience was that almost 90% of boys who presented with this problem are cured by the application of steroid cream.   In cases of balanoposthitis, circumcision can be indicated but less invasive surgical techniques such as frenuloplasty produce excellent results as reflected in one of his own research papers (the reference for which he provided).  In terms of the more generally perceived health benefits associated with HIV protection and non-HIV sexually acquired infections, Dr Muir&#8217;s opinion was that there may be some small benefit in circumcision but the studies have not been compared with safe sex and condom use in at risk patients.  As to prevention of urinary tract infections, he said that to prevent one urinary tract infection, over one hundred circumcisions would have to be performed which he regarded as an untenable proposition.  Similarly, in terms of overall hygiene and cleanliness, he was of the opinion that, from a medical point of view, normal bodily hygiene was all that was required.</p>

Children should have competence before consenting to a procedure which was not medically indicated.  In the absence of any discernible or direct medical benefit, a patient (be they child or adult) should always be competent to consent to the surgery.

In terms of the appropriate procedure were the court to authorise circumcision for these two boys, he told me that sleeve circumcision was the preferred, and safest, option.  If they were old enough to consent to the procedure, they were usually old enough to consent to a local anaesthetic which was safer than a general anaesthetic.  Here, the children would need a general anaesthetic if the surgery was to be undertaken now.  They would be off school for about 48 hours and would thereafter need to avoid contact sports for seven to ten days.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Thus, in one sense, the two medical experts were approaching their task from different perspectives.  Dr Ahmad does not have the surgical experience which Mr Muir has because he is a consultant paediatrician.  He was certainly medically qualified to provide me with an overview of the possible risks and benefits but he did not have (and did not profess to have) the particular experience and expertise which Mr Muir had of this surgical procedure and its possible consequences.  Dr Ahmad had not read Mr Muir&#8217;s report when he gave his own evidence by video link and deferred to his colleague at appropriate points in his evidence.  Mr Muir had not only read Dr Ahmad&#8217;s report; he sat in court to listen to his oral evidence.  It was clear that there were aspects of the medical evidence in respect of which there were marked disagreements of emphasis and substance between the two witnesses.  On one view, it might be said that an experienced surgeon who specialises nationally in problems arising out of complications resulting from circumcision would be exposed to the reality of these risks as part and parcel of his daily professional life and thus more cautious in his approach to evaluating risk.  However, on balance, I found Mr Muir&#8217;s evidence to be careful and helpful.  He was not approaching his task from any religiously informed perspective and that was not his function albeit that it is an important aspect of the issues which need to be weighed and balanced in this case.  I heard separately from other experts in that respect.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The father told me that, having heard the medical experts, he remained wholly committed to his application that these children should be circumcised.  He was able to convey to me in very clear and direct terms the depth and strength of his religious beliefs despite what he described as &#8220;some bad things&#8221; he had done in the past.  For himself and for his sons in due course, he said that circumcision went to the very core of his identity as a Muslim man: that was how essential it was in terms of way he perceived himself and his children.  His own father, his uncle and his grandfather were all circumcised and it was a fundamental part of his personal and family identity.  He did not know how he would be able to look his father in the eyes if his application is not granted. Both he and his family would feel devastated.  In this respect circumcision had both a religious and a social importance which overrode any slight risk which the procedure carried.  In terms of its religious importance, his view was that if the obligation had been created by Allah, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;he knows it is in our best interests&#8221;</span>.</p>

He felt that she had &#8220;moved the goal posts&#8221;.  She was a Muslim when they went through a ceremony of marriage; they had discussed these issues at length and she was keen that the children should be circumcised in accordance with their (then) jointly held religious beliefs as early as possible.  He told me that the children mixed with his own Muslim friends and their children during the time which they spent with him.  He was teaching them Arabic and they attended sessions at the Islamic school at the local mosque.  He described his experience of practising his religion in a small rural village as being very different from the time he was able to spend with a large group of extended friends when he visited London with the children.  He was, nevertheless, doing all he could to ensure they were familiar with their religious heritage and Islamic beliefs and festivals.</p>

He wanted the opportunity to take the children to Disneyland.  He viewed it as entirely natural and appropriate for the children to spend time with his own family in Algeria since it was his homeland and he wished them to know something about the circumstances in which he had grown up as a child and subsequently as a young man.  He told me that it was difficult for his parents to travel to England, although his mother had visited before.  It transpired during the course of the evidence that the children had been having Skype sessions with their paternal grandparents although this was not revealed by the children to their mother.</p>

He told me that he had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;left thirteen years of his life behind in London to live in the middle of nowhere&#8221;</span> just to be close to the children.  When he was cross-examined by Miss Saunders on behalf of the Guardian, he acknowledged that, in the event he was granted permission to take them to Algeria, it would be a disaster for the children if they were not returned to the care of their mother just as it would be contrary to the teachings of Islam.  He pointed more than once to the fact that he never attempted to abduct the children in all the time he had been having unsupervised contact.  When I asked him at the conclusion of his evidence what justification he saw now for my taking &#8220;the first leap of faith&#8221; in him, he said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;If I say it </span>[i.e. taking them to or keeping them in Algeria] <span style="font-style:italic">did not cross my mind, I would be lying to the court.

He saw it as an opportunity to teach them more Arabic and he felt they would gain a lot.  He was keen to be more involved in their school and with the day to day aspects of their lives, including any medical issues which might crop up.  He saw no benefit to the children in being cared for by their nanny in the absence of their mother when he had the flexibility to make himself available to look after them.  The Friday evenings he was spending with them in alternate weeks when they did not stay for the weekend were absorbed by football club at school and so they were unable to spend time at his home.  Whilst he acknowledged that the holidays had been shared on a more or less equal basis since August 2014, he was currently seeing them on six days a month whereas they were with their mother or the nanny for the other twenty-four.  He wanted a little more balance in those arrangements for the sake of the children whom he felt were being raised by the nanny in the mother&#8217;s absence.</p>

She did not believe the procedure was medically necessary.  It was an irreversible and permanent step which was likely to cause them pain and it was not a decision which either she or their father should take now on their behalves.  She recognised the strength of his religious convictions and was not seeking to place any obstacles in their practice of his faith whilst they spent time with him.  They could still attend prayers with him and go to the mosque as often as he chose to take them, but a decision in relation to such a final and irreversible procedure was best deferred until the children reached a level of maturity to make the decision themselves.  She did not intend to bring them up in the Islamic faith.  Neither she nor her partner held any structured or formal religious beliefs and the children had no Muslim friends at their school.</p>

She said that if she had been asked before she met the father what her views about circumcision were, she would have been unable to provide an answer because the issue would not have entered her sphere of experience.  She explained that when she met the father and fell in love, she wanted very much to please him.  She was happy to listen to his thoughts and wanted to defer to him.  In 2009, when L was a small baby, he had persuaded her that it was a simple procedure and one from which their son would very quickly heal.  She had other Muslim friends at the time whose babies had been circumcised and she simply assumed that, as parents, they would do the same thing.  The father had wanted to delay matters to a time when the children would be conscious of the procedure and recognise it as part of their Muslim faith.  He had also wanted it done in Algeria in the midst of his family.  The mother told me that it was only once she had found the strength to leave the controlling environment of their relationship that she was able to carry out her own research and form her independent views on the subject.

Although he was away for the last Eid festival, I talked to them about Eid and made them available to speak to him when he asked.  I don&#8217;t in any way undermine their practice of Islam. A &#8216;competing&#8217; faith would not be fair to the children.  I do not intend to &#8216;campaign&#8217; with them towards a more liberal way of thinking.  Their father&#8217;s religion will be an important part of their upbringing.  The danger is that, because he adheres to a fundamental religion which imposes strict beliefs on its followers, he believes that his beliefs carry more weight than mine.  My beliefs do not exist within a religious framework as such but they are equally strongly held.&#8221;</span></p>

As his parents get older, she believes that motivation will only increase and, put simply, she fears that were he to retain them beyond an agreed period of travel, she would be unable to secure their return to her care for the remainder of their childhood and adolescent years.  Whilst she recognises that France is a Hague Convention country, she says that he used the direct Marseilles to Algiers ferry link when he travelled to England in 2001.

Whether or not that is indeed the case (and I shall set out my findings about the father in due course), I have no hesitation in accepting that this remains the mother&#8217;s subjective belief.  I could sense the extent to which it was difficult for her to sit in the same court as the father as the hearing progressed.  Her body language visibly tightened and she became very tense, albeit controlled, when she was dealing with many of the questions put to her, perfectly properly, by Mr Chapman.

She told me that there had been significant changes for the children as contact has developed under the court&#8217;s supervision over the past eighteen months.  Given the children&#8217;s need for predictability and stability, the speed of the changes had been very difficult to manage.  Her own professional routine of work as a full-time solicitor meant that she had limited time at home with the children in any event and, were they to spend even longer periods with their father, it would undermine the stability of their current family unit which included her partner and C.  She told me if she could afford to stay at home with the children, she would but financially it was not an option.  Her partner currently spends part of his working life abroad and family time is precious.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:2in">In relation to shared care, he takes the view that the order regulating the time the children spend in each of their parent&#8217;s homes should remain as it is at present.  The only change he supports is a stepped increase after three to six months by means of a single midweek overnight stay in substitution for the Friday evening football club outings with the father.  He suggests that this should be an activity-based period of contact so that it does not detract from time which the boys would otherwise spend with their half-sister, C.  He does not support any incremental increase thereafter although he hopes and expects that the parents will adjust these arrangements, as necessary, as changes occur over the coming years.  He is anxious to see this litigation come to an end now and does not recommend further reviews in, say, six months&#8217; time.</p>

She was able to recognise not only the strength and depth of his relationship with their children but also the benefits which their enjoyment of that relationship bring to L and B.  That acknowledgement is much to her credit.  She has demonstrated her willingness to allow the father&#8217;s influence over the boys in terms of the religious upbringing they receive in his home to find a limited degree of reflection in the lives they lead in her home.  That cannot have been an easy thing for her to do given the history of her relationship with the father and the manner in which it ended.  Her life now is very different from the life she led with him in London during the time they were together.  I have no doubt that it would be very much easier and less stressful for her if she were simply able to close that door and absorb these two children into an insulated family life in North Devon which reflects her current, more liberal, approach in the context of her current social circumstances and the less structured agnostic beliefs she now holds.  Nonetheless, she recognises that these boys have the right and entitlement to benefit fully from their dual heritage and, whilst she does not actively promote their Muslim religious education within her home, she does not seek to erect barriers against it.  I have confidence in her to maintain that position as the children grow and become more aware of the different environments in which home life is lived with their parents.  In my judgment, there is much in what the mother says about the boys&#8217; emerging ability to &#8220;compartmentalise&#8221; their lives as they move between the two homes. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">That she is a good and emotionally intuitive mother was abundantly clear to me from the evidence she gave.  Despite the somewhat controlled and precise manner in which she gave her evidence, she presented me from time to time with illuminating vignettes of family life within her household.  These showed me a nurturing, warm and loving environment with much laughter and fun absorbing all three of the children living within it.  I accept that she would wish to spend much more of her time looking after the children but for the financial imperative to support them financially.  She has no doubt worked hard and diligently to gain the professional traction she now has in terms of her career and she has structured her present child care arrangements in the best way she can to ensure that the children have a seamless transition from &#8220;nanny&#8221; to &#8220;Mummy&#8221;.  It is an arrangement with which the children are settled and familiar.  Sometimes their maternal grandmother is involved in these arrangements but all the evidence points towards a happy, secure and grounded arrangement which sees them moving happily between home, school and their father&#8217;s home some nine or ten miles away in a neighbouring village.</p>

I accept as entirely genuine her all-consuming fear that, if they travel to Algeria, she may never see them again.  She did not enjoy the best of relationships with the father&#8217;s mother during the short period she spent with him in the family home in Algeria.  Certainly, she does not regard the children&#8217;s paternal grandmother as any form of check or balance in the event that father were to decide to act irrationally.  To the contrary, in this mother&#8217;s eyes, that lady is one of the &#8220;pull&#8221; factors (as she described them) which is likely to lead to that which she fears so much.  Whilst my focus throughout has to be these children and their best interests, I have no hesitation at all in finding that the mother would be completely devastated if these children were to be retained by the father in Algeria without her consent.</p>

I have no doubt at all that he loves his children deeply and they return that love and affection.  I am prepared to accept that, in making these applications, he is genuinely promoting to the court what he regards to be in their best interests.  But he sees those best interests very much through the prism of his own deeply held moral and religious beliefs.   Those beliefs are entitled to the utmost respect from this court whose role in this parental dispute is to determine the course which will best safeguard and promote the children&#8217;s best interests.  It is much to the father&#8217;s credit that he has been able to put behind him the drug use in which he formerly indulged.  He has been prepared to sacrifice a rich and multi-cultural life in central London, a life he chose over and above his former life in Algeria, for a different life in a rural community where I suspect he feels it is less easy to practice his religion so freely and where he knows that he is likely to be singled out as being somehow separate and apart from those around him.  He told me about his frequent trips back to his London Muslim community, both with and without the children, and that evidence only serves to reinforce the sacrifice that he has been willing to make in terms of the compromise of his own lifestyle in order to continue to be part of his children&#8217;s daily lives.  Whilst I suspect that the original impetus behind his decision to track down the mother and the children was his desire to rekindle some form of relationship with her, I am prepared to accept that he recognises that life has now moved on for them both.  The fact that he has stayed and made a life for himself close to the children is further testament to his commitment to remaining an important presence in their lives.</p>

With some justification, the father asks rhetorically what else he can do to convince the court of his good intentions.  He said during the course of his evidence that he could not change the fact that he was an Algerian and that his home country was a non-Convention country.  He pointed to the fact that he had been having unsupervised contact since the summer of 2014 and had never sought to abduct these children or remove them from their mother&#8217;s care.  He urges me to take the first leap of faith but recognises that any wall of trust he is able to erect will need to be built brick by brick so far as the mother is concerned.  How, he asks, is that process to be commenced if he is not given the opportunity to demonstrate to her and to the court that he can be trusted to return the children?</p>

I believe that he does indeed understand that their physical and emotional wellbeing flows from, and depends on, the care she provides on a day to day basis.  I take the view that much of his resentment of the current arrangements with the nanny stems as much from cultural issues as from any criticism of the mother&#8217;s abilities as the primary carer of these children.  He was brought up in a home where he was reared entirely by his mother.  His experience of family life as a child was not influenced by English attitudes towards working families being the norm in households up and down the land.  I suspect it is difficult for him to accept that what the mother describes as the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;wrap around care arrangements&#8221; </span>which she has put in place should displace, or take priority over, the care which he could give their sons.  I suspect, too, that a part of him probably feels that she is dictating terms to him as a parent and that somehow his &#8220;rights&#8221; or status as an equal parent are being downgraded.  He was entrusted by her to care for these children, and L in particular, from the time they were tiny infants.  He finds it difficult now to understand what has changed.</p>

I agree with the Guardian that he has little understanding of the reasons for the deep-seated mistrust of the mother.  Whilst he acknowledges he has behaved badly in the past, he appears to believe that the page should now be turned simply because of the passage of time and his commitment to the present arrangements which have become more relaxed as the litigation has progressed.  The Guardian spoke in his evidence of a sense he had that these parents were already beginning to work together and sort things out for themselves.  Whilst I would hope that will become the case, I have to say I did not see much evidence of that myself albeit that my observation of the parties was confined to their appearances in the more stressful confines of the court and the witness box.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">The greatest risk to these children, as I perceive it, is one of an unpremeditated decision on the part of the father to retain these children in Algeria at the end of a period of authorised travel.  I believe his motives in wanting them to experience life and family in Algeria are genuine.  The children know they have a family in Algiers; they speak to their grandparents by Skype.  I have no doubt that their father speaks to them often about his childhood and early life growing up in that country.  These are memories he wishes to reflect in their sharing that experience with him by means of regular visits to Algeria in the coming years.  However, it is not difficult to see how, once back in that familiar environment where he is likely to receive the unqualified support of his parents, he may convince himself that, no matter what the mother has to offer these children, it is better for them to grow up fully immersed in their Muslim culture and tradition.  I do not know what influences may operate once he is back in Algeria.  Whilst I am told that his parents are prepared to provide oaths or undertakings, I have not seen or heard them.  I simply have short emails.  The father has made me well aware in his own evidence of the attitude which they take to these proceedings and the need for their grandchildren to be circumcised.  A combination of influence from his family, his religious leaders and the fact that England will be a very long way away may well operate on his mind in terms of the imperative which he has told me he regards to be his own sacred duty as a father to these children.  The fact that he was prepared to admit in evidence that the thought of removing the children to Algeria or retaining them there had crossed his mind from time to time is to his credit, but it demonstrates to me that these thoughts are very present in his mind to this day, albeit he assures me he would not act on them.</p>

Whilst my evaluation of that risk remains &#8220;slight&#8221;, I am more concerned about the possible risk of retention after a period of contact in Algeria.  In my judgment, and for the reasons I have set out, my evaluation of that risk is greater than the risk of abduction per se.</p>

It is, in my judgment, of equal application here.  These are still very young children whose lives are only just achieving equilibrium and balance after a difficult and stressful period of change.  Litigation and conflict between their parents has been the backdrop to their existence for the last three years.  I accept that they have engaged their own strategies for coping with these issues and that they are now experiencing a loving and secure family environment which embraces the periods of time which they spend in their father&#8217;s home.  The transition between those two homes has become part of the routine of their lives and they are coping well, according to the evidence I heard from MS.  Were that structure to be unilaterally dismantled by the actions of the father, it would on any view have an appalling effect on their emotional wellbeing.  The effect on their lives would be shattering.</p>

I do not place any weight on the offer of a bond of &#163;50,000 as a fighting fund, generous though that offer from his sister might be.  I am aware, not only from the evidence of Mr Edge but also from my own experience of these international cases, that any litigation in the local Algerian courts could take years.  The mother is simply not in a position to drop all family ties here and engage in that sort of litigation.  She has a very young child to care for who will remain in this jurisdiction come what may.  Whilst the cost of litigation may well be proportionately less expensive in that jurisdiction, any fighting fund put in place would have to include provision for the cost of international air travel and accommodation whilst she is in Algeria.  She would be likely to have to attend several hearings over a lengthy period of time.  I am conscious of the disadvantage at which she would find herself in those proceedings if it were brought to the attention of the court that she had renounced her embrace of the Islamic faith and was now living with a non-Muslim partner in circumstances where the children were not being brought up as Muslims within her home.  Mr Edge was clear to me in his concerns for her in this respect.  He said her position would be regarded as &#8220;sinful&#8221; and he would regard her status in the local courts as &#8220;extremely worrying&#8221;.  I share the Guardian&#8217;s concern that she could have no confidence in her ability to be able to bring the children back.  Further, if the father were to be given an indication by the local Algerian courts or by his legal advisers that his position in retaining the children in that jurisdiction would be sanctioned as an appropriate and proper discharge of his religious and parental duties, his resolve to return them to this jurisdiction might well disappear.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I must also bear in mind that we are living in an advanced technological age where instant means of communication are developing with every day that passes.  Whilst I am conscious of the rights which the children and the father have under Article 8 to respect for their private and family life &#8211; which, in the case of these children, includes respect for their Algerian heritage &#8211; I must also pay due and proper regard to the mother&#8217;s Article 8 rights for her family life as it is presently constituted.  That family life will be ruptured in a very significant way if these children were retained in Algeria against her wishes in circumstances where she was unable to secure the children&#8217;s return.    There is no evidence that the children&#8217;s grandparents and other extended family members cannot travel to England to see the boys although I accept that this would inevitably mean they incurred the costs and inconvenience of making arrangements for accommodation and the like.  There does not appear to be any particular problem in relation to financing such travel whether in respect of the father&#8217;s ability to purchase tickets for himself and the children or his family&#8217;s ability to pay for or sponsor his parents&#8217; travel to England.  I appreciate that they are now retired but his mother has made the journey on at least one occasion of which I am aware.  Even if direct contact with extended family members in England is not possible for whatever reason, they are having Skype contact already and there are many other means by which the father can teach his children about modern Algerian life without being physically present in that jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Having thought very carefully about all these matters and weighed each factor in the balance, I have reached the clear conclusion that, given the risk of abduction or retention in this case, I cannot say that I am positively satisfied that the advantages to these children of visiting Algeria outweigh the risks to their welfare which that or future visits will entail.  Because I am left in doubt, I must err on the side of caution and accordingly I refuse to make the orders which the father seeks in relation to international travel to a non-Hague Convention country.  The existing orders in respect of these prohibited steps will therefore remain in place until further order.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">In terms of travel to France, which is a Convention country, I have reconsidered all these matters afresh.  I do not set them out again but they inform my conclusion that I cannot safely say that the safeguards provided by the provisions for summary return encapsulated within the Convention and the obligations imposed upon Member States who are signatories to its terms will have the necessary degree of protection for these children.  Whilst I accept that they represent real and tangible safeguards for any child abducted to or retained in a jurisdiction which is a Convention country, the reality in this case is that, if the father did form any intention to remove or retain these children, France (or any other Convention country) would be likely to be no more than the springboard for a removal to Algeria.  The remedies provided by the Convention would not assist the mother once he had left that jurisdiction.  The reach of the Convention would not extend into Algeria and her position would be exposed in terms of securing their return from that jurisdiction.  I cannot ignore the fact that flight from France to Algeria, if necessary through the use of false travel documents, would be a simple reversal of his earlier inbound passage to England.  He has family in Marseilles.  There is a direct ferry route from Marseilles to Algiers.  Whilst the magnitude of the risk of an abduction from France to Algiers may be less than the risk of a retention in Algeria were I to have granted permission for travel to a non-Convention country, it is a risk which cannot be eliminated on the evidence I have heard.  In the event of an onward flight to Algeria, the magnitude of the risk for these children remains as I have described it above.</p>

I regard the continuation of the prohibited steps order in respect of European travel to a Hague Convention country to be a proportionate exercise of the court&#8217;s powers given the three elements which I have to bear in mind throughout.  The risk of onward flight exists, albeit that the risk is not great; the consequences in the event of a breach outweigh any possible benefits to these children in terms of the prejudice to their wellbeing; and the safeguards of the Hague Convention would not apply since a breach by the father is likely to involve onward travel to Algeria.</p>

These are not children who enjoy the benefits of extensive travel abroad with their mother.  She cannot afford to offer them that benefit at the present time and I am therefore not imposing any restriction on this aspect of his parenting which does not apply through force of circumstance to hers.  It may well be that, in time to come, as the children are older with independent voices of their own, the situation may change.  However, for the foreseeable future, I am not prepared to sanction any travel outside the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  </p>

I have to look at this issue from the perspective of the children whose interests outweigh any particular position adopted by either one of their parents.  I acknowledge that in so doing I am treading into the &#8220;deep waters&#8221; identified by the President in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B and G (Children)(No 2)</span> but the polarised positions of the parties make that course inevitable.  I bear in mind that the mother is not set against circumcision as an option for these children in the future when they are old enough to consent to the procedure themselves but she does not agree to it now in circumstances where, if it is to go ahead, the court will have to consent (or give permission) on their behalves.</p>

His motives are driven by his deep-seated religious convictions and his perception of his obligations as a devout Muslim father.  The Guardian acknowledged the fundamental importance of circumcision as an &#8220;obligation&#8221; for a Muslim father.  To an extent, his application to this court is a partial discharge of that obligation or duty.  In the face of opposition from the mother, he has pursued an entirely legitimate application, albeit that it is one which will be decided in the context of English law.  In accordance with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into our domestic legislation by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>, the right to respect for his and the children&#8217;s family life includes his freedom to practice his religion.  If and insofar as the expression of that religion imposes on him an obligation to ensure that his children are circumcised, the law will only prevent that course if it does not coincide with their best interests.</p>

She accepts that, at a time when their elder son was an infant, she accepted that he would be circumcised in accordance with the wishes of the father.  For so long as they shared a common home with the children, the expectation was that these children would be brought up as Muslim children.  Their parents socialised with other Muslim families and the mother&#8217;s evidence is that she was aware that it was common practice for their friends&#8217; children to undergo circumcision.</p>

	      </authorialNote>, the children are now living in a home where they are receiving an essentially secular upbringing.  That is likely to remain the case throughout their respective minorities.

With his encouragement, they attend classes at the mosque where they pray with their father.  They observe prayers appropriately at his home.  They are receiving instruction in the Arabic language and can already recognise some words and phrases in religious texts.  They will become aware, if they are not already, that their father has been circumcised.  However, they will not grow up in an environment within their mother&#8217;s home where circumcision or the observance of daily prayers is part and parcel of family life in that household.  They are already aware that their mother does not espouse the Muslim religion and that there is a difference between them and their younger half-sister in this regard.  Whether or not with the encouragement of the father, I accept that there has been some spontaneous reference by the boys at their mother&#8217;s home to C being different from them in this respect.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Fourthly, the likelihood is that they will continue to spend time attending the mosque with their father as they develop into more independent young boys and, if they are not circumcised, there is a risk that they may feel alienated from that religion or from their peers who have been circumcised.  It is not unreasonable in these circumstances to envisage that they may be the subject of either teasing or some gentle, if well-meaning, pressure.  In this event, there is a risk of further litigation because the mother made it quite clear to me that, whilst she will not seek to influence the children one way or the other, she will not hesitate to bring the matter back to court if she perceives the father, or others at his behest, to be applying inappropriate pressure to the children.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">In this context, I believe this risk is a real one.  The father told me that he was as certain as he could be that these children would indeed be circumcised during their childhood.  In my judgment, consciously or not, he would find it almost impossible not to convey to these children the strength of his own convictions that circumcision is not only the inevitable result of the discharge of his parental obligations, but a perfectly normal incidence of Muslim life and devotion to Allah.  This lack of insight on the father&#8217;s part placing, as it will do, a burden on the shoulders of these children, is not a positive indicator in favour of circumcision but it is nonetheless a factor which I have to balance with all the others.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Thus, in the light of the factors I have mentioned above, circumcision would confirm the identity of these children as part of the Muslim community.  It would eliminate the father&#8217;s anxieties and would remove the likelihood of the children being the subject of any further attempts to influence them one way or the other by either parent.  The procedure is irreversible: once it is done it is done.  The father would have no further reason to complain and the mother would no longer be in a position to object.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Those factors must be weighed in the balance against the fifth, and important factor, that, just as the father is passionate in his cause and the reasons for circumcision, the mother is resolutely opposed to it at this point in time.  As the authorities make clear, it is a strong thing indeed to impose a medically unnecessary surgical procedure on a parent who has primary care of young children who opposes it.  An inevitable consequence of granting the father&#8217;s application would be the emotional pressure on the children caused by the mother&#8217;s distress.  However hard she tried to contain her emotions, I do not believe she would be able to shield the children entirely from her sense of distress on their behalves.  The strength of her convictions was all too obvious from the witness box.  There is a rational basis for the mother&#8217;s opposition and, if the court sanctions the procedure, it is something which she is going to have to live with on a daily basis as a constant reminder of the parental conflict which exists between her and the father.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I remind myself, too, that as a result of that parental conflict these children have been the subject of litigation for the majority of their young lives.  That is not good for any child and it makes them vulnerable to adult tensions to which they should not be exposed.  I believe that this mother would find it difficult to present the issue of circumcision to the children in a positive light and they, in turn, are unlikely to understand why they are being put in a position of pain and discomfort &#8211; if only for a short period of time &#8211; if there is no genuine medical need for the operation to be carried out.</p>

The father&#8217;s evidence was that, whilst his parents would find the whole situation very strange, he did not anticipate that they would discriminate in any way in respect of their grandchildren whether or not they were circumcised.  There is already evidence that the local and London mosques which the children attend would continue to allow them to participate in religious community life regardless of their state of knowledge as to whether or not the children were circumcised.</p>

First and foremost, this is a once and for all, irreversible procedure.  There is no guarantee that these boys will wish to continue to observe the Muslim faith with the devotion demonstrated by their father although that may very well be their choice.  They are still very young and there is no way of anticipating at this stage how the different influences in their respective parental homes will shape and guide their development over the coming years.  There are risks, albeit small, associated with the surgery regardless of the expertise with which the operation is performed.  There must be clear benefits which outweigh these risks which point towards circumcision at this point in time being in their best interests before I can sanction it as an appropriate course at this stage of their young lives.</p>

I am not dismissing his application on the basis that they must develop into adulthood as uncircumcised Muslim males.  I am simply deferring that decision to the point where each of the boys themselves will make their individual choices once they have the maturity and insight to appreciate the consequences and longer term effects of the decisions which they reach.  Part of that consideration will be any increase in the risks of surgery by the time they have reached puberty.  I do not regard the delay between now and that point in time significantly to increase those risks.  The safest point in time to have carried out the procedure, according to Mr Muir, has long since passed.</p>

The Guardian accepts that the father&#8217;s motivation for increased time with the children is soundly based on his wish to build on their relationship as they grow older.  The parties and the children will now have had more than the three months which the Guardian recommended as the minimum period for quiet reflection for all concerned.  The children will have had a further term of regular school routine.  In my judgment, the Guardian&#8217;s recommendation that these children will be ready to move on to an extra night of staying contact with their father during the week is well judged.  I share his view despite the mother&#8217;s opposition to any increase in overnight staying contact.  I think these children are well able to cope now with an additional overnight stay at a midweek point if that is combined with some form of activity which does not detract from the family time they would otherwise be spending at home with C.  I shall leave the parties to agree upon the most suitable week night in the alternate week when they do not spend weekends with their father.  That new regime should commence with effect from the beginning of their new summer school term.</p>

I have confidence in these parents to continue the preliminary steps of the dialogue which they have started in this respect.  The prohibited steps order will remain in place preventing the removal of either child from the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  I shall dismiss the father&#8217;s application in respect of circumcision and I propose to include a declaratory recital in my order recording my view that it is not in the children&#8217;s best interests to undergo the procedure at this point in time and, in any event, until they are competent in terms of their age and maturity to make the decision for themselves.</p>

I have given much thought to this case and I have read and listened carefully to all that has been said on his behalf.  The mother, for her part, may well feel anxiety about the increase in the children&#8217;s contact with their father which I have sanctioned but I am confident that she, too, will do what she can to ensure that the transition is an easy one for the boys.  Both these parents love their children.  But the time has now come for this litigation to end.  It has run its course and they, together, must find the means to communicate effectively so as to ensure that it is they, as parents, who shape their children&#8217;s futures together rather than any future intervention by the court.</p>
