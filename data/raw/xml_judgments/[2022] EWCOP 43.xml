The treatment itself is not unusual and is, within the field of haematological oncology, a mainstream standard chemotherapy treatment. The intention to deliver two cycles and then review comes about because of the unusual circumstances in which treatment is being started on the basis of an uncertain diagnosis.  The position of the Trust in seeking to administer it, is that whilst not curative, there is sufficient clinical reason to think it will prolong life and may improve the quality of that life. It is, the Trust submits to me,  at least life improving and arguably life sustaining. </p>

The first entry should be of&#160;&#160;any factor or factors of actual benefit&#8230; Then on the other sheet the judge should write any&#160;counterbalancing dis-benefits to the applicant. An obvious instance in this case would be the&#160;&#160;apprehension, the risk and discomfort inherent in the operation. Then the judge should enter&#160;on each sheet the potential gains and losses in each instance making some estimate of the&#160;extent of the possibility that the gain or loss might accrue. At the end of that exercise the&#160; judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible&#160;gains against the sum of certain and possible losses. Obviously, only if the account is in&#160;&#160;relatively significant credit will the judge conclude that the application is likely to advance&#160;the best interests of the claimant&#8221;.&#160;&#160;</p>

In some cases, in some situations, they may carry much, even, on occasions, preponderant, weight.

One cannot, as it were, attribute any particular&#8239;a priori&#8239;weight or importance to P's wishes and feelings; it all depends, it must depend, upon the individual circumstances of the particular case. And even if one is dealing with a particular individual, the weight to be attached to their wishes and feelings must depend upon the particular context; in relation to one topic P's wishes and feelings may carry great weight whilst at the same time carrying much less weight in relation to another topic.

Into that complex matrix the appropriate weight to be given to P&#8217;s wishes will vary. What must be stressed is the obligation imposed by statute to inquire into these matters and for the decision maker fully to consider them&#8221;&#160;</p>

The fact is that all life involves risk, and the young, the elderly and the vulnerable, are exposed to additional risks and to risks they are less well equipped than others to cope with. But just as wise parents resist the temptation to keep their children metaphorically wrapped up in cotton wool, so too we must avoid the temptation always to put the physical health and safety of the elderly and the vulnerable before everything else. Often it will be appropriate to do so, but not always. Physical health and safety can sometimes be brought at too high a price in happiness and emotional welfare. The emphasis must be on sensible risk appraisal, not striving to avoid all risk, whatever the price, but instead seeking a proper balance and being willing to tolerate manageable or acceptable risks as the price appropriately to be paid in order to achieve some other good &#8211; in particular to achieve the vital good of the elderly or vulnerable person&#8217;s happiness. What good is it making someone safer if it merely makes them miserable?&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p>

From Dr Martinez-Calle&#8217;s report of discussions with ward staff, I know that MB responds positively to their visits and has been seen talking and laughing with them during those visits.  They have been consulted by the Trust and by the Official solicitor.  Their views reflect the turmoil so often affecting those who are close to someone diagnosed with very serious conditions which require debilitating and gruelling treatment. They first gave a view that they would not wish him to be exposed to intensive and invasive treatment if the improvement to his condition for having endured it would be little or nothing. Yet also they expressed the view that his former partner and his younger &#8211; still very young &#8211; daughter are important parts of his life, and were he able to form and express a view he would want treatment that might give him more time with his daughter. Having listened to the evidence from the consultant haematologists, intensivist and psychiatric experts, and clinicians, I heard from his aunt and his niece -relayed via Ms Sutton- that they each thought he should be given the chance and that they believed that he would want treatment. I heard that that that was now their own view which was a shift in how they felt having listened to the way in which the medical witnesses explained their views. His aunt and his niece were though, very worried about what it might be like for him and were especially concerned about the prospect of delirium. Despite all of those misgivings they firmly felt the proposed treatment should happen and that it should take place all in one admission to ICU rather than in two separate episodes. A second  aunt who is a woman of Faith particularly wanted it known that she would pray about the proposed treatment and her position was communicated through MB&#8217;s niece. Those views are ones to which I have paid close attention.  Likewise, to the fact that they are views that have developed and evolved over the course of hearing the oral evidence. I hold in my mind that these are people who have known MB as the boy he once was and the man he became before he was unwell and so bring another perspective to those who know him only as a patient or as the person who is subject of this application. </p>

I have made it clear to them that whilst their views are a very important part of the process of reaching a decision, that decision is mine not theirs, and the weight of it not theirs to bear.

MB has been a difficult patient to treat on the ward and his illness has caused him to present challenges, including challenges to the physical safety of those caring for him, but I did not detect the slightest sense that he had become a problem to be solved rather than a person whose best interests lay at the heart of  the clinical debate.   I was especially stuck by the way in which  Dr Brown said that it was so difficult to decide what was in his best interests that she had found it helpful to step back and ask herself the question &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">if this were me or if it were someone I cared about what would I want for them?&#8217;</span></p>

Dr Martinez-Calle regards the therapy as sub-optimal for a T-cell lymphoma and puts the prospect of success at only 20 % with a high rate of relapse within 5 years. His view was that the diagnosis is more likely than not (in the sense of 51%) correct. The 2 cycles would be likely to confirm that. His view was that 2 would be needed before one could confidently know if it was working. Dr Jones took a similar view. Both told me that the circumstance in which they would stop after one cycle only would be if MRI scanning showed that the disease had continued greatly to progress despite the high dose MTX. Dr Martinez-Calle said that his view was that the proposed treatment is life sustaining and should be attempted. The T-cell lymphoma will be lethal and so, although the success rate predicted is low, it is, in the final analysis, in MB&#8217;s best interests to have it. Dr Jones&#8217; view was similar.</p>

They each held the view that whilst there was clear and structural damage on the brain scans the active infiltration is what one would hope to reverse and have some improvement in functioning. It is impossible to know in advance whether there will in fact be improvement, but the point made by Dr Martinez-Calle which I accept, is that it is the only prospect of improvement. In his evidence he told me that one of the things that makes unpredictable the outcome is that sometimes a patient with a scan that looks very bad makes a recovery and vice versa. When Dr Jones came to give her evidence she echoed this. She, as it happened, gave her evidence after having heard those from the psychiatric field and said that their evidence that the proposed treatment was the only prospect of some improvement in executive functioning was important to her thinking. As I see it and having in mind the balance sheet approach urged on me by the Official Solicitor some prospect of an improvement of MB&#8217;s functioning is a significant positive.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is before me a wealth of detailed evidence about the way in which an admission to ICU would be carried out in the circumstances of this case. Dr Nesbitt  consultant anaesthetist and Dr Danbury consultant in intensive care, have each been asked to assist, if that is to be the manner of delivery, on which of two options would be preferable having regard to the risks involved. The first is to have one unbroken admission whereby MB is sedated, intubated and ventilated at the start of a period, the first cycle is delivered, the necessary recovery period between cycles occurs, and then the second cycle is delivered and only at the completion of the second will the process of awakening, extubation and a move out of ICU to be undertaken. The best estimate of the minimum time for such an admission is about 14 or 15 days.  The second is to have 2 admissions where by MB is sedated intubated and ventilated at the start of a period, the first cycle is delivered, he is then awoken extubated and moved out of ICU for the necessary recovery period and then readmitted to repeat the process for the delivery of the second cycle.  Dr Nesbitt&#8217;s oral evidence was that he and Dr Danbury had discussed at the multi-disciplinary meeting the risks of a single admission as against two and that he felt that they had thought the risks were of a similar order of magnitude for each. Elaborating in what he meant he said &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">effectively we are swapping one set of unquantifiable risks for another&#8217;. </span> His view, from the point of view of his own discipline was that his preference would be 2 admissions.  Taken again to the comparative risks by Ms Sutton he did not move from that view, but he would agree that if the evidence from those in the field of psychiatry was that the benefits from the point of view of their field of a single admission outweighed the risks, he would accept a single admission provided there was a clear and coherent plan agreed that the risks could be assuaged. He volunteered to me that as he gave his view that others in his position might well take the opposite view.</p>

It remained his view, he said, that this is an incredibly finely balanced case which is proving very difficult for three different specialities where the expertise do not overlap. He would take at face value the views of those from haematological oncology and psychiatry if they thought there could be an improvement by undertaking the treatment but his own view remained that  admitting him to intensive care would probably do more harm than good. Very prominently in his thinking featured the almost inevitable prospect of delirium for, he would think, at least a week perhaps substantially longer. The more so if the chemotherapy did not improve the functioning of his brain. He thought there was a strong risk of PTSD. In addition to these risks he felt that there were physical risks from intubation and ventilation leading to, for example, ventilator induced pneumonia; arterial and venous line infections and catheter urinary infections raising the prospect of sepsis. Were MB to become septic in the circumstances here, Dr Danbury pitched the mortality rate at just below 50 %. Given the very serious reservations he was expressing in his evidence and his view that admission to intensive care would probably do more damage, he was asked if it was his view that the treatment plan should not be embarked upon.  He responded <span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;it is finely balanced from the perspective of all three disciplines. From my perspective if he were in my unit and oncologists were suggesting it then we would not be offering to do it&#8217;. </span>Reminded as I have been by the Official Solicitor of Dr Danbury&#8217;s experience and expertise in serious medical treatment cases before this Court, that was a striking answer. Later in his evidence he observed &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">I think if I were more certain of the benefit on his neurocognitive state I would be confident that it fell on the other side but my view is the structural changes are sufficient to explain his function changes and so I don&#8217;t think it is worth doing&#8217;</span></p>

Reflecting on all of the differing risks to be taken into account he ultimately favoured a single unbroken admission. From his detailed and helpful evidence it seemed to me that the tipping point for him was the avoidance of a second episode of intubation and extubation between the 2 sessions and the associated removal of lines. He also gave evidence that whilst a first admission to intensive care is a venture into the unknown, subsequent admissions even for those with poor memory carry with them anticipatory anxiety which disproportionately affects them and would be likely to lead to greater effort to achieve the admission especially were there to be persisting delirium. I reflected on that part of his evidence when considering the views of those from the field of psychiatry and the weight they each gave to a diminution of the prospects of increased delirium as part of what inclined them to favour a single admission. As well as coming to the conclusion that one unbroken admission did not materially increase the risks flowing from the length of it as compared with two shorted admissions in quick succession Dr Danbury&#8217;s clear view was that the question of one or two admissions should not be left as a matter of clinical judgment at the time but that for those carrying out the treatment it would be better for this decision to be made by the court</p>

As to what were described as the &#8216;disbenefits&#8217; of undergoing the proposed treatment they both regarded delirium as an almost inevitable outcome. There was agreement too that for someone with MB&#8217;s profile delerium would be difficult to treat or to manage and that one cannot predict how long it might endure. I found their evidence on this point both illuminating and disturbing. I can well see why it was an aspect of this case which so worried MB&#8217;s family. It is a serious negative. I had the impression that Dr Brown was slightly more sanguine about whether PTSD was quite so inevitable. Her view was that so impaired is his memory that, since a component of PTSD is how memories are laid down, she thought it may not be that MB would progress to it. On this point Dr O&#8217;Donovan differed. Whilst she agreed that Dr Brown was right to say memory has a fundamental role in PTSD  she said this: &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">we know from individuals who had all manner of mental health difficulties and had also had PTSD that memory could be distorted   but yet the trauma response is not dissimilar&#8217; </span>and she went on to give the example of offenders who commit offences when very unwell and with no apparent awareness but go on to develop perpetrator PTSD. </p>

Even though the benefit might be small since as she observed &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">we don&#8217;t know how much his functioning will change or improve if at all and already there is evidence of cerebral atrophy and cell death that is not going to change, and we don&#8217;t know how much executive functioning is impaired by that and how much by T-cell lymphoma and  we don&#8217;t know his response yet  and if functioning will be  the same as  it is now&#8217;</span> .

The view of Dr O&#8217;Donovan was that putting MB through that once was preferable to twice.  Dr Brown though saying she would incline to defer to the ICU specialists on whether it should be one or two admissions, agreed that from a purely psychiatric point of view one was better.  It is interesting to note that Dr Danbury to whom Dr Brown would properly defer on the number of admissions, himself comes down in favour of one over two (recognising of course that he says the treatment should not proceed at all) in part because of the anxiety effects that he describes as affecting those who are repeat admissions to intensive care. </p>

I do not regard him as being an outlier amongst those from whom I have heard since having re-read  his evidence it has been noticeable to me that at each point where he expressed strongly his view that the treatment was not something he advocated and would indeed not be prepared to undertake he acknowledged both the scope for professional difference of view within his own specialism and that his own view came with the caveat that he would accept those of the other two disciplines involved. The haematologists nd the psychiatrists all recommend proceeding with the treatment.
