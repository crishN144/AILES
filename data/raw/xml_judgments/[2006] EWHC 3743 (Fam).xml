The respondent is distantly related to the petitioner by virtue of her maternal aunt in law.  The refusal of the proposal resulted in pressure being brought to bear upon the petitioner, albeit that the pressure at that time was gentle and consisted of oral persuasion and some indication that the family, particularly the grandparents, would be opposed to Miss L maintaining a career.  The pressure increased and continued and I am satisfied that on one occasion Miss L was beaten with a stick and on another occasion slapped in the face by virtue of the grandparents&#8217; belief that she was not succumbing to their control of her life.  Accusations were made against her by her grandparents and her means of communication with friends and other members of the family were severely curtailed by the removal of her mobile telephone. </span></p>

The petitioner was in Tanzania without immediate family support, she having accompanied her maternal aunt-in-law and maternal uncle but without recourse, whether by phone or other indirect means, to her own parents and brothers. </span></p>

It is clear from the affidavit of the petitioner that there had been some pre-planning in that a file containing bank statements and payslips were provided to the British High Commission in support of that visa application. Those bank statements and payslips must have been provided to the maternal aunt-in-law via the grandparents with whom the petitioner lived.   </span></p>

GUPTA</span><span style="font-family:LAOIEI+TimesNewRoman;font-size:13pt">:  Your Ladyship, I was just thinking about the way that your Ladyship has conducted this hearing because it neatly sidesteps all the issues, that in the courts are fashionable at the moment, concerning the veil.  I spoke to the Clerk of the Rules two days ago and asked whether or not screens could be provided, whether one could detect the sex of the judge, and was told, no, but as it happens, of course, it was listed in front of your Ladyship and it has been a practical solution to what could have been a difficult problem, as your Ladyship saw from my position statement. </span></p>

GUPTA</span><span style="font-family:LAOIEI+TimesNewRoman;font-size:13pt">:  That really decides all the issues, that if the matter is listed under a female judge and if temporary screening, and if an umbrella is used, that evidence can be given and that one does not enter into a debate about whether or not the identity of the petitioner or the individual who is wearing a face veil has to be ascertained and whether her oral evidence is to be given without a veil.  As I said, it just is such a practical solution and can be dealt with without any alleged human rights arguments, putting it that way, because I think it is a traditional rather than a religious question.  My client may differ on that. </span></p>

She had concerns about removing her veil in order to give evidence before me.  She was concerned by virtue of the fact that these proceedings are held in open court and that she was represented by a male counsel, it being fortunate that no other member of the court is male.  In the circumstances, and to facilitate the hearing this morning, the petitioner indicated that she was willing to remove her veil in order that I could observe her demeanour and expression at the time that she gave me her oral evidence, provided that she could be screened from the view of Mr. Gupta.  Mr. Gupta also agreed. </span></p>

The ability to observe a witness&#8217; demeanour and deportment during the giving of evidence is important and, in my view, essential to assess accuracy and credibility.  It is a matter of extreme importance that witnesses in such sensitive cases as this should be permitted to present their case to the satisfaction of the court but also observing their religious observance of dress.  In my view, the facility of screens and the ability, if at all possible, to list these cases before a female judge, would obviate the objections of litigants or witnesses subject to an assessment of the genuine nature of their unwillingness to appear before the court without the veil. </span></p>

If I could just point out that I will draft up the order, and I will also talk to your learned Associate about the Associate drafting up the order in this other nullity matter in the family law as to exactly what forms are necessary from the Principal Registry.  I gather it took a bit of time to obtain them. </span></p>
