	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in">On 18 May 2023, sitting in the Family Court in Leeds, I handed down judgment following a long and complex fact finding hearing involving three families each of whom had a child treated for long term gastroenterological presentations at Sheffield Children&#8217;s Hospital (SCH). Staff at SCH suspected that each mother had deliberately harmed their child by administering noxious substances or non-prescribed medication, and by contaminating their central lines with faecal material. The mothers in each family had been arrested by police following referrals by staff at SCH. I refer to the judgment <span style="font-style:italic">Re BR (Three Families: Fabricated or Induced Illness: Findings of Fact)</span>, 18 May 2023, [2023] EWFC 326.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in">This judgment is intended to set out the reasons for determinations arising out of challenges by a witness in the proceedings in <span style="font-style:italic">Re BR. </span>I consider it necessary to do so in order to provide clarity in a complex situation. Due to the applications now made I am required to comment on my own judgment. However, this judgment is not to be taken to gloss or qualify the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re BR.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in">The handed down judgment was anonymised: the children, members of their families, and all treating and other healthcare professionals were given ciphers. Expert witnesses were named. At the date of handing down, all three mothers were on bail having been arrested by the police. Due to ongoing police investigations I directed that the judgment would not be published and could not be communicated, save to a restricted list of individuals, including the expert witnesses and key treating clinicians, until the police and/or Crown Prosecution Service have either decided that there would be no prosecutions or have brought prosecutions but each set of criminal proceedings had concluded, or until further order. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in">On handing down the judgment, some of the parties invited the court to remove the anonymisation of one of the treating clinicians, Dr SAA. He was one of the team of consultant paediatric gastroenterologists at SCH and had played an important role in the referrals of the mothers, MS and MT, to social services and to the police. Dr SAA was not aware that such a request was going to be made and he was not represented. The Trust responsible for SCH was an intervenor and was represented by Counsel but Dr SAA no longer works for that Trust. Accordingly, I gave notice to Dr SAA of the request and invited him to respond, in particular to the requests,</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in">Whilst awaiting Dr SAA&#8217;s response I was contacted separately by two Counsel who had been involved in the fact finding hearing before me, and who were now involved in other cases of alleged FII in which Dr SAA was respectively a key witness as the treating clinician who had made a referral to the authorities, and as an expert witness. Those Counsel asked whether they could refer to the judgment but I had not given permission for it to be disclosed or published save to the limited number of individuals I had already named on 18 May 2023. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.84in">The request in respect of the first case, which was being heard in the Family Court at Middlesbrough, was very urgent: Dr SAA was due to begin his oral evidence in a fact finding hearing in two working days from when I received the request. I did not know the facts of the case and could not determine the relevance of my judgment to that case. Rather than giving permission to Counsel to refer to the judgment, the course I took was to self-direct that I send an anonymised copy of the judgment to the judge in the Middlesbrough case, HHJ Murray, permitting him to share it, or parts of it, with the parties in the case before him as he considered fit and on conditions he decided were appropriate. I made that order on 8 June 2023 and I immediately informed Dr SAA that I had done so. At that time I did not know he was represented. Ms Morris KC then informed the court that she was representing Dr SAA. I informed HHJ Murray accordingly and Ms Morris KC made representations to him before he made any decision about sharing the judgment with the parties in his case. Having considered submissions on behalf of Dr SAA, the judge decided to share limited, anonymised extracts from my judgment with the parties, informing them of the identity of Dr SAA.</p>

Dr SAA had been instructed as an expert in that case. The judge in that case ultimately decided not to disclose any of the judgment to the parties but did decide to dispense with Dr SAA as an expert witness.</p>

Dr SAA had been instructed as an expert witness but, so I was informed, had withdrawn as an expert. The judge did not know why but had been informed by Counsel in the case before him (who were not Counsel in the fact finding hearing before me) that I might be able to provide an explanation. In the circumstances it did not seem to me to be necessary to do so or to provide him with a copy of the judgment.</p>

I refer to the order in full. It restricts reporting of the case, including the evidence and the judgment, until any criminal proceedings have been concluded, or the police or CPS decide that no such proceedings will be pursued against each of the mothers. The police have not made any such decisions yet and, despite being pressed, have not yet given information to the court as to the likely timetable for such decision-making save that it is likely to be at least several weeks before any decision is made. Therefore, to protect the integrity of the criminal justice system, the publication of my judgment on the National Archive is not likely to take place for some weeks, possibly months. I have asked the police if they object to a short summary judgment being published, without the determinations on the facts being included, so that some of the lessons to be learned from the events I have considered can be made public. They have objected to such a course being taken.</p>

There is an undoubted, and critical importance, in open justice and transparency of the court system. There is also a critically important public interest in the freedom of the press to report without restriction, protected by article 10 ECHR. There is a more specific public interest on the facts of this and similar cases, in the public understanding what is happening in these sensitive cases, and the very difficult factual and human issues involved. Often, there is an important public interest in protecting the identity of the child and the wider family. However, in this case the parents have waived their and Midrar's confidentiality, and the Guardian raises no objection to this.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[12] However, there are competing interests. Firstly, that of the treating professionals to their private life (protected by article 8). Secondly, there is a strong public interest in professionals who are doing a difficult and extremely important job (the care of critically ill children) in being able to do that job without feeling that their privacy and their ability to work is being jeopardised. Not least, the public interest lies in ensuring that appropriately qualified people do not avoid these type of cases because of the fear of becoming the target of hostile comment, and that comment even extending to their families.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[13] My task is to balance those interests. In my view the public interest in open justice is very largely protected in the present case by the fact that the proceedings are in public and the judgment is in public. Further, relevant to the facts of this case is that the Hospital is named, as is the child. There is therefore no question of secret justice, or the public not being fully informed as to what is happening to Midrar and in the proceedings generally.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[14] It is, in my view, difficult to see why either open justice or the public interest is harmed, save to a minimal degree, by the anonymisation of the treating professionals. This is not a medical negligence case, and although the Father has made allegations about the treatment, those are not substantiated by evidence and not pursued by Mr Quintavalle. On the other side of the balance, I do take into account the fact that this is not a case where there have been (so far as I am aware) hostile comments either in the press or social media about the hospital staff, and there has not been any harassment towards them. There has been some, but not extensive, press comment, although it is not possible to know whether this will increase or decrease after the judgment. However, these type of cases concerning the treatment of very ill young children, raise very strong views and there is a well documented history of hostile and distressing comments about treating staff in other cases. I also note that the Father has made some very damaging, and wholly unevidenced, allegations against staff. I do not consider it appropriate to wait until such hostile comment, or worse, arises and then decide that an RRO should be granted. That is to shut the door after the horse has bolted.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[15] I accept Mr Farmer's point that many people may find it traumatic to be named in the press in the course of litigation, and that is no ground to grant anonymity. However, the position of treating professionals is somewhat different. There is a significant public interest in allowing them to get on with their jobs, and in minimising the disturbance to them and their other patients whilst they are providing that care.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[16] These cases are necessarily fact specific and I do not purport to set down general guidance. I do however somewhat differ from the views expressed by the President in A v Ward as set out above. This may be because the facts of the case differ. In my view there is an important distinction between professionals who attend court as experts (or judges and lawyers), and as such have a free choice as to whether they become involved in litigation, and treating clinicians. The latter's primary job is to treat the patient, not to give evidence. They come to court not out of any choice, but because they have been carrying out the treatment and the court needs to hear their evidence. This means they have not in any sense waived their right to all aspects of their private life remaining private. In my view there is a strong public interest in allowing them to get on with their jobs without being publicly named. I do not agree with the President that such clinicians simply have to accept whatever the internet and social media may choose to throw at them. I note that the President's comments were made before the well publicised cases of Gard and Evans, and perhaps at a time where the risks from hostile social media comment were somewhat less, or at least perceived to be less. There may well be cases where the factual matrix makes it appropriate not to grant anonymity and each case will obviously turn on its own facts. But in my view the balance in this case falls on the side of granting the order.</p>

For present purposes, the decision of the House on the facts of Campbell and the differences between the majority and the minority are not material. What does, however, emerge clearly from the opinions are four propositions. First, neither article has as such precedence over the other. Secondly, where the values under the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each.

A salient feature of the case I have to consider, which does not appear to have been relevant in the cases before Lieven J and the President, is that Dr SAA is known to be a treating clinician who has been involved in referrals to authorities in other cases of alleged FII which are before the courts, and who has acted as an expert witness in other ongoing FII cases, and may do so again in the future.

In the present case the S and T families have been subjected to state interference with their families as a result of perceived risks to their children from their mothers but I have found that the allegations against those mothers were not proved, indeed that the mothers did not act as alleged. It does not follow that the interim protective steps were not justified given the risk assessments made at the relevant times. However, the impact on these families of the decisions made at SCH and, on referral, by the local authorities and the police, have been very considerable. They have a right to speak about their experiences and about the findings that the Court has made after a comprehensive hearing. I recognise also the general public interest in knowing how cases of perplexing presentations and suspected fabricated or induced illness are managed within the NHS, and the impact of decisions about suspected FII on families. In this case the fact that there has been a detailed finding of fact hearing and judgment is relevant. There is a further interest in publication of Dr SAA&#8217;s name, which is that he is known to be an important witness, as a treating clinician, and (at least until now) as an expert, in other FII cases.</p>

I am not concerned with a case which involved life sustaining treatment of the kind referred to by the President which has been known to attract particularly strong feelings in those who come to know the facts, or some of the facts, of a case. Here, because of the restriction on publicity ordered to protect the integrity of the criminal investigations and potential criminal proceedings, the wider public have no knowledge of this case as yet. However, I do take into account that, upon publication, there could be some adverse response from a small part of the public to one or more treating clinician.</p>

When the courts are required to make findings of fact in relation to allegations of FII, sometimes the courts will find that the allegations are not proved. I accept that publishing the names of clinicians in those cases may have a &#8220;chilling effect&#8221; on treating clinicians generally, as well as on those particular clinicians, in future cases. If clinical judgments made in good faith may be the subject of public criticism by the courts, then defensiveness might be encouraged. That in itself might be contrary to the best interests of children who are being treated and who have perplexing presentations. </p>

I did not find that he acted without integrity in his dealings with the patients or in his evidence before the court. This was not a case where I contemplated referral to his professional body and no party to the proceedings invited me to do so. Dr SAA has taken it upon himself to notify his professional body &#8211; that was a matter for him but I did not require him to do so. Whilst I found that he played an important part in the referrals of MS and MT in October 2021 and that those referrals would have been avoided had certain steps been taken, I did not find that his decision-making was in bad faith or negligent. I made it clear that there was a collective responsibility for failures to take appropriate steps in line with national guidelines on managing cases of suspected FII.  I did find that his evidence on a particular issue was exaggerated but not that his evidence was dishonest. The findings or observations that I made about him as a witness and clinician were of a kind that, I dare say, are not uncommon in very many judgments. Judges commonly find a witness&#8217;s evidence to be unreliable on a particular incident, or may comment on the performance of a professional&#8217;s duties, such as the conduct of a child protection medical, or an ABE interview, or a police search. My findings and observations about Dr SAA fell within that category and were not anything more serious. Hence the public interest in knowing his identity is less than it would be had more serious findings been made about his conduct.</p>

In my judgment, absent Dr SAA&#8217;s involvement, or potential involvement, as an important lay witness and expert in other FII cases, I would not allow the removal of his anonymisation as a treating clinician in the present case. I took the view at the outset of the finding of fact hearing that the treatment clinicians would not be named. I am not persuaded that Dr SAA&#8217;s conduct justifies making him an exception to that rule. His conduct was not reprehensible or negligent and the observations I have made in my judgment about the management of the three cases of suspected FII at SCH do not focus on his role alone. To remove his anonymisation but not that of the other treating healthcare professionals would focus disproportionate attention on him, with a corresponding added interference with his private and family life that could not be justified only by his evidence and conduct in the present case. </p>

I cannot know the details of each of those other cases or further cases which might arise, but I anticipate that in one or more cases it might be a legitimate subject for cross-examination to question Dr SAA in about his involvement in <span style="font-style:italic">Re BR</span>, as evidenced through my judgment. It does not follow that his evidence in other cases will not be accepted &#8211; the nature of my findings and observations about him do not fatally undermine his credibility. They do not undermine his claim to have expertise in FII cases. They do not bring into question his competence as a clinician or an expert. However, there may be parts of my judgment concerning him that resonate in other cases and about which, if they were aware, Counsel or the parties in those other cases would want to question Dr SAA. That appears to have been the position in the case before HHJ Murray. Counsel in <span style="font-style:italic">Re BR</span> will know about his involvement even before the judgment is published. Others will not know anything about the case prior to publication and, if he is anonymised, they will not know after publication. Those others would be at a potential disadvantage compared with Counsel or solicitors in the case before me. They would be deprived of a potential line of cross-examination or submission. Injustice could result. Mr Storey KC suggests that appeals and re-hearings could follow. Counsel in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re BR</span> would be placed in professional difficulties by knowing about my judgment and Dr SAA&#8217;s role in it, whilst their clients and other representatives remained unaware.</p>

That would avoid the need directly to inform parties in other cases of my judgment and Dr SAA&#8217;s identity. However, the judgment may not be published for a number of weeks or months because of the time it will take for the police and/or CPS to make prosecution decisions, or for any prosecutions to be concluded. If Dr SAA is anonymised in the judgment, then the risk of an injustice being caused in other FII cases in which Dr SAA is involved will continue. Furthermore, in my view, it would be disproportionate to remove his anonymisation in the judgment when a measure less invasive of his Art 8 rights could be taken to ensure that injustice is avoided in other cases in which he is involved and that Art 10 rights are protected.</p>

Pending publication of the judgment that mechanism should be in place. I have considered carefully whether to require that the mechanism should continue after publication of the judgment. Ms Morris KC has raised the question of how long the court should keep control over what Dr SAA tells judges in cases in which he may become involved &#8211; would this be a lifelong requirement? I accept that such a requirement would be disproportionate. In my view once the judgment has been published on the National Archive, then the requirement of Dr SAA pro-actively to inform judges of his role in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re BR</span> should cease. Of course, he will still have to answer questions about his role in <span style="font-style:italic">Re BR </span>should they be asked of him either as an expert or as a lay witness and he must not mislead any court. The judgment will be available to all involved in other cases of alleged FII.

It seems to me that it should apply only to cases in which FII is alleged, where the allegation is disputed, and in which Dr SAA is either an expert witness or a treating clinician who was involved in the referral to social services or the police of a case in which an adult is alleged to have fabricated or induced illness in a child. Out of fairness he should give a judge in such cases copies of both the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re BR</span> and of this judgment. He should inform the judge that he is Dr SAA. He may inform the judge, if this is the case, that an appeal against the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re BR</span> is pending.

Given that HHJ Murray did consider that justice required parts of the judgment to be shared with the parties in his case indicates that had I not provided the judgment to him, there would have been a risk of an injustice being caused. Further, Counsel for the Local Authority in that case, who was Counsel in <span style="font-style:italic">Re BR</span> and therefore had possession of my judgment, would have been placed in the professionally difficult position of calling Dr SAA to give evidence, knowing of potentially relevant material in the judgment which might have been of assistance to her client or to the other parties in the case, but being unable to refer to it.

The judge found that SW was the principal instigator of this joint enterprise and that SW had drawn the other professionals in. The judge found that both SW and PO had lied to the court with respect to an important aspect of the child sexual abuse investigation. The judge found that the local authority and the police generally, but SW and PO in particular, had subjected C to a high level of emotional abuse over a sustained period as a result of their professional interaction with her. In addition to the specific adverse findings made against the local authority, SW and PO also complain that there was no justification for the judge deploying the strong adjectives that he used in describing the scale of his findings in a judgment which, in due course, in its final form, will be made public.&#8221;</p>

However, the broader context of the whole judgment is relevant including for example, paragraphs 168-172, the beginning of 173, and 31. As is clear from the judgment as a whole I recognised the very difficult position that the treating clinicians found themselves in when, as Dr SAA did, they made decisions about the children in the three cases with which I was concerned. I did not find that Dr SAA had been guilty of lying to the court, of dishonesty in his professional practice or otherwise, of conspiring with others, of negligence, of incompetence, or of inappropriate conduct. </p>

Unsurprisingly, sometimes witnesses&#8217; accounts of incidents differed or were inconsistent with contemporaneous records. Evidence from different witnesses about a particular incident is not given simultaneously: evidence relevant to an event might be given by witnesses on days 5, 25 and 50, for example. It would not be feasible to recall witnesses to give further evidence whenever other evidence was given that contradicted their own. Very serious allegations were made against three mothers and those allegations were strongly contested. The court&#8217;s role was to consider all the evidence and to determine whether the allegations were proved on the balance of probabilities. Inevitably, some evidence, including witness evidence, would not be accepted by the Court. It would not be feasible to give every witness notice that the court might not accept their evidence, and to give them an opportunity to respond before the final judgment was handed down.</p>

The draft judgment was sent to Counsel for the parties and to Leading and Junior Counsel for the Trust, prior to handing down.

Ms Morris said in oral submissions that I had found Dr SAA to have been dishonest and that his integrity was called into question. I do not accept that characterisation of the judgment. I have to have regard to the words used in my judgment rather than my intentions. Dr SAA&#8217;s evidence was that at the time of the referral of MS to social services and the police, HS had an appearance &#8220;akin to an African child in a famine, just skin and bones.&#8221; I had to weigh that evidence against a contemporaneous record of Dr SAA&#8217;s ward round which noted that HS &#8220;looked well&#8221; and other evidence, including evidence from the family that HS was able to play on his i-pad and a photograph of HS from the relevant time. I preferred the evidence that HS was not as unwell as Dr SAA had described in his evidence which, I found was &#8220;exaggerated&#8221; in this particular respect. Dr SAA had chosen to use a somewhat emotive description of HS&#8217;s appearance which was not, in my judgment, supported by other evidence. His description portrayed HS&#8217;s condition as worse than it was. It was an exaggeration. I did not state or imply that his evidence was dishonest.</p>

Their mothers were accused of deliberately causing their children profound pain and suffering. The consequences of those accusations were that the mothers&#8217; families were split apart. Along with some of his fellow gastroenterological consultants, Dr SAA expressed the view that the evidence strongly pointed to the mothers MS and MT being guilty of inducing potentially fatal illness in their children. He played an important role in the referral of those mothers to the authorities. The mothers strongly disputed the allegations and that the referrals were justified. The court had to make determinations on disputed facts. One of the key allegations brought by ERYC against MS was that on 19 October she deliberately interfered with her child&#8217;s feeding line,</p>
