On these occasions the mother allowed him to stay on the couch in her home, and the father's parents also visited at least once, with the mother&#8217;s agreement.  In March 1999, the mother and children visited Dublin for A&#8217;s fifth birthday.  This was the last occasion on which the girls saw their paternal grandparents.</p>

She loves the children and they undoubtedly love her.  Everyone who knows A, B and C speaks extremely highly of them, and this must be to the mother's credit.  I do not lose sight of this very important aspect of the children's situation when coming to consider the local authority's allegations.  The question is whether it is the whole picture, as the mother contends.  The local authority acknowledges the positive aspects, so far as they go.  As the social worker, put it, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The mother&#8217;s influence on the children has not been entirely bad or destructive: it is much, much more complex than that.&#8221;</span></p>

Neither she nor her boyfriend wanted to have children of their own, and in any event she had had an elective sterilisation in 2001.  They discussed adopting from abroad, but he was not keen.  This perhaps contributed to some extent to their separation, which occurred without undue animosity in June 2004.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">By this time, it would appear that the mother was coping with the demands of bringing up and home educating A and B.  However, the stresses on the family increased markedly, in my view, with the arrival of a third child.  By 2004, it had become much harder to adopt from X and she therefore selected country Y, where adoption was less regulated.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The lawfulness of the mother's actions in relation to C&#8217;s adoption has not been investigated at this hearing.  Concern has been raised as to whether United Kingdom adoption requirements were circumvented.  In November 2004, the mother had obtained a home study report containing significant inaccuracies from an American social worker based in Germany.  However, C was not adopted under United States law and it is common ground that the adoption in Y is not recognised in England.  In March 2006, C was registered as a British subject. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Following C&#8217;s arrival, she had difficulty in settling and made demands on her mother and the older children.  A, in particular, was heavily involved in her care.  The mother was concerned about whether C was attaching to her, and twice in 2006 she consulted a community paediatrician for advice.  She received reassurance and some suggestions, including advice (which she did not find of much value) that she might try being less directive with C.  Given the degree of involvement of the older children, the paediatrician is said to have wondered who it was that C saw as her mother.  It is likely that the bond between the mother and C was from the outset less secure than that with the older children, perhaps as a result of C&#8217;s experiences in infancy.  </p>

No adult was even informed of this arrangement, let alone put in charge.  In her evidence, the mother was slow to acknowledge the irresponsibility of such an abandonment.  She appeared to think that A's agreement was an excuse: she had agreed to stay behind on the pretext that she would not enjoy the heat in Arizona, but in reality because the trip would otherwise have been unaffordable.</p>

As to this, I note that the mother herself said in her first statement in these proceedings that she received the letter from the United States Embassy in October 2007.  She now says that she challenged the refusal and that ultimate confirmation was not received until a phone call in January 2008.

The mother had made a will in which she had appointed a friend of hers to be A and B&#8217;s guardian in the event of her death, to the exclusion of the father.  She asked the father to give his written agreement and, when he quite reasonably refused, took strong offence.  Secondly, the father did not attend A's 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday in 2000, which disappointed A and angered the mother. </p>

The mother became extremely ill with pelvic inflammatory disease and had to go to hospital, leaving the children at home.  She remained in hospital for a month.  At the outset, her GP made a referral to social services out of concern for the children's situation.  The mother was resistant to social workers seeing the children, who were then 15, 13 and 4.  I do not accept that she was at that stage too ill to express a view: in any event, the view she expressed is consistent with her general antipathy to social services.  At all events, a social worker did visit and managed to speak to the children on the doorstep.  Eventually Mr P arranged a roster of adults, with himself and his wife to the fore, to support the children until the mother was discharged from hospital.  In effect, C was being looked after by A and B for that month.

A, for one, has the ability to express herself orally and in writing in a manner of which any parent or teacher would be proud.  B also made a very good impression during the course of a quite lengthy conversation with Macur J.  Both young women are interested in education and have the ability to do well.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The mother was determined that the child should, if possible, be a girl.  She persuaded A to undertake a number of practices designed to influence the gender of the child.  A prepared for insemination by using four or five syringes of acid douches containing vinegar or lemon and lime juice.  On one occasion, at the mother's instigation, A inserted a tampon soaked in lime following insemination.  This was so painful that the mother agreed that she need not do it again.  A was also required to follow a diet of dairy and alkaline foods in an attempt to maximise the chances of conceiving a girl.  The mother also gave her tracks to listen to on her MP3 player which contained subliminal messaging saying <span style="font-style:italic">"I am going to conceive a girl".</span></p>

I used those very words.  She held my hand.  She seemed upset, but she smiled and seemed calmer than earlier.  I was shocked but I don't think that I showed it.  I felt better after that.  In the years that followed it was always in my mind.  I was always worried I wouldn't become pregnant, how long it would go on for and if it would ever end.  I was relieved and happy when I became pregnant, but scared that I would miscarry.  Feelings of gratitude for my adoption influenced how I behaved."</span></p>

She thought it unlikely that A was pregnant, but carried out a pregnancy test, which turned out to be negative.</p>

She had had symptoms of nausea and abdominal pains.  She told the mother, who was bitterly disappointed and insisted that they visit the doctor to check whether she might still be pregnant, even though A did not think that she was.  The story about the youth club was invented between herself and the mother.</p>

She, the mother, did not believe that A was pregnant, but A wanted reassurance.  She asked A to invent the story of the youth club because she felt that the doctor would view her own AI attempts with suspicion.</p>

He describes A's story as unfolding as a &#8220;happening&#8221;, not an accusation.  It was a free flowing narrative born out of a desperation to tell him.  As she spoke, he could see a weight lifting off her.  She was extremely frightened of seeing her mother again and also frightened that her mother would go to prison.  However, by the end of the discussion she appeared relieved and started talking about the future.  She asked Mr P to take away the card that the mother had sent because she did not want it near her.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There is no challenge to Mr P<marker name="tab"/>'s evidence, and I accept it in its entirety.  Having seen both him and A give evidence, I can entirely understand why she might have wanted to unburden herself to him.  As she put it: <span style="font-style:italic">"I told him because I trusted him and I knew that if I didn't tell someone then I probably never would.  I trusted him to do the right thing with the information I gave him.  I was scared to go home, because I knew I wouldn't be able to raise D as my child and I was scared at how my mum might raise him."</span></p>

His intervention, like that of the midwives, was of crucial importance in protecting these children.  It is no coincidence that A has named her baby after him, and no surprise that the mother rejected the name, saying that <span style="font-style:italic">"If she had changed her mind and chosen any name other than D I would not have had any issue with that."</span></p>

She was insistent that A give her home address to the Benefits Agency, even though she would not be living there: <span style="font-style:italic">"No one is going to know that you're not there and it will make things easier."  </span>Later on, she said that she felt as if A has died and she cries all the time.  She referred to the social workers as <span style="font-style:italic">"horrible"</span> and encouraged A to say that she would be unhappy in the foster home (which she had not yet arrived in) and wanted to go home.  Significantly, she asked:<span style="font-style:italic"> "Did you say anything to anyone about the father?"</span>  She refers again to <span style="font-style:italic">"the Almond Danish"</span> and ends with a psychologically pressuring account of C&#8217;s alleged distress at A&#8217;s absence.  </p>

She is using her influence to split the girls, unsettle A and recruit B to her side.   At one point in A&#8217;s cross-examination on behalf of the mother, she was asked whether she realised that her evidence might mean that C might not be able to go home.

In evidence, and on other occasions, the mother has said that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the children are my entire life&#8221;</span>.  Parents often say this sort of thing as a way of expressing their love for their children: it is a shorthand<span style="font-style:italic"/>way of saying that there is nothing that one would not do for one&#8217;s child.  For this mother the idea has become sadly distorted to mean that there is nothing that she would not ask her children to do for her.  For the present it is clear that she represents a significant risk to the safety of any dependent child in her care.</p>
