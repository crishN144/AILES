The parties decided not to progress any divorce petition or the separation of their assets at that point in time.  A petition was then issued by the wife on 20 October 2017 and decree nisi was pronounced on 3 May 2018.   </p>

A substantial portfolio has been built up largely through the husband&#8217;s work and his connections in property.  He worked in property sales in Spain in the 1980s.  He then became involved in a company that was set up by his friend, Mr A.  I am told that it was hugely successful and was sold and that the husband finally stopped work for that company in 2001.  His main business dealings have been with a small circle of friends, including Mr A, Mr Stephen Brook, Mr B, Mr C, and also a Mr D, a gentleman who I am told he met working in Spanish property in the eighties and they then went into a venture on a Spanish island (&#8216;the Spanish Development&#8217;) along with Mr A.   </p>

The husband&#8217;s case is that the paperwork about some of his assets is limited.

He says that the properties and pensions should be divided to ensure that the wife does not retain any ties to his business associates and/or friends.  He says that whilst some of these people with whom they are connected have been lifelong friends and they were all very close during the marriage, the wife&#8217;s relationship has broken down with them since separation and he says that that has been as a consequence of her behaviour both inside and outside these proceedings.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">A significant feature of this case has been the wife&#8217;s diagnosis with a hoarding disorder.  This is a problem that was apparent and that escalated during the course of the marriage although was only recently diagnosed as such by the single joint expert who was appointed within these proceedings.  The wife&#8217;s case is that 50 percent of the assets would not be enough to meet her needs including those arising from her disability and she says there should be a departure from equality in her favour, which would be a distribution of the assets of approximately 53 percent to her and 47 percent to the husband, or thereabouts.  She says it is imperative that she should retain the matrimonial home.   </p>

He was often careful to acknowledge where he did not consider he was qualified to comment on matters pertaining, for example, to the wife&#8217;s health or financial issues.  He told me that he is keen to be fair to the wife.  He did not ultimately challenge the medical evidence about her condition but whilst conceding that there were issues with her health even during the course of the marriage, and he says that that led to the marriage breakdown, he frequently sought to compare her situation with his.  So whilst he acknowledged her condition, it seemed to me that he did not always acknowledge any real impact of it and I felt at times he was lacking insight or empathy in that regard.  Despite his history and experience in business, he told me that he would need the same support in managing investments in the future as she would despite the fact that the symptoms that she experiences in connection with her diagnosis are said to include delay and procrastination in making decisions and also that she has a fear of financial hardship. </p>

He has made concessions about shortcomings in some areas of his evidence.  He has acknowledged that his finances are not straightforward and he says that he did not realise when embarking on the litigation the extent of the detail that would be required.  In respect of his written evidence, he conceded that, &#8220;on occasion there have been errors and omissions&#8221; in his disclosure.  He said that in respect of his oral evidence, he had done his genuine best but he accepts that there were what he characterised as innocent errors.   </p>

When he was asked about the impact of the Metropolitan Line extension, instead of answering about the impact it had on land that he has an interest in, it took him three times for that question to be posed until he conceded that the value of the investment would be likely to benefit.  He did also concede that he was likely to need to have a conversation with the registrar about the Register of Members&#8217; Interests and I bear in mind that might account, in whole or in part, for his hesitation in answering those questions. </p>

The difficulty is that he himself points out the fallibility of human memory.  He accepts that he has a poor memory.  He does not dispute the wife&#8217;s account about certain matters about which he says he does not have an explicit recollection.  He professed to have an absolute conviction about other aspects of his evidence even though he did not initially recall the events.  He says his memory has been prompted by third parties and, if I were to accept that evidence, I must remind myself that there are areas in which he is reliant upon the accuracy of information that is being provided to him and I have to bear in mind those matters when I am considering the weight I am able to attach to his evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Mr Brook gave quite lengthy evidence in support of the husband.  He is a highly experienced solicitor and a long-term close friend of the husband.  I found him to be incredibly vague and obtuse in many areas of his evidence.  He often sought clarification before answering questions at all, such as when he was being asked about his practice in keeping ledgers for client transactions.  He suggested that the questions were &#8220;too vague&#8221; and said that he was not keen to discuss &#8220;hypotheticals&#8221; although when direct questions were put to him, a frequent answer from him was &#8220;not particularly&#8221; rather than anything more concrete.  It was particularly hard to glean with any certainty whether there was any further paperwork in his possession that might have assisted the court with its task.  He confirmed that he had kept his own personal records separate from his company&#8217;s records.  He would only go so far as to say that there were &#8220;some notes&#8221; in his possession although said he could not say what they covered and where and in what form they had been kept. </p>

He said that he had acted for the husband but not acted for the partnership.  He sought to draw a narrow distinction between acting for the husband on a transaction and then entering into a deed of trust afterwards with him regarding the same property.  He described that as being a separate private matter despite acknowledging that he would have been aware of the intention to enter into the further transaction during the conveyancing process.  He disputes that he has had any intention to exclude references to files in the husband&#8217;s name.   </p>

He told me that the wording of a given declaration of trust was not exhaustive as he said &#8220;you cannot anticipate what will happen&#8221; which I found to be an extraordinary contention given his expertise.

It is not disputed that their contributions have been equal with the wife as homemaker and the husband in using his entrepreneurial skills to develop their asset base.  The wife recognises the husband&#8217;s great skill in bringing people together and making a great success of ventures.  When he went into business with Mr A in the 1980s, they built up the company together and that was sold at considerable profit.  They now have a portfolio of properties and investments in the UK and abroad, many of which were held alongside third party interests.  The husband&#8217;s case is that some of those investments have been better than others and he says the wife must take the rough with the smooth. </p>

The difficulty within these proceedings has been the lack of supporting evidence for the details of those investments.

He accepts that his financial affairs are complicated and are hard for others to understand.  There is, of course, a duty on him within litigation to provide disclosure in a form that enables his financial affairs to be readily understood both by his wife and by the court.  Unfortunately, his evidence has fallen short of that standard in a number of regards.  His own evidence has changed in many respects during the course of the proceedings.  That history of this litigation, with changing assertions being put forward in respect of certain assets by the husband and his witnesses, and the lack of documentary evidence has led to voluminous documentation being produced. </p>

The St John&#8217;s Wood property is a property owned in the husband&#8217;s sole name but beneficially owned jointly with Mr Brook.  It was tenanted until July 2013.  After the tenants moved out, it was refurbished and the husband has been living there since the end of that year.  He says the plan was for this to be a short-term measure but he is still there now.  &#163;300,000 was spent on an extensive refurbishment, &#163;220,000 on the property, and &#163;80,000 on furnishings, including high value art works.  The husband paid those sums and did not seek a payment from Mr Brook.  He says he is owed &#163;110,000 for Mr Brook&#8217;s half share and that this &#8220;would be accounted for at some stage of proceedings&#8221; but he says that he would also owe Mr Brook notional rent for the time that he has spent there now that it is no longer tenanted and there would therefore need to be an offset.  He says that there is no formal accounting or paper record of this.  This &#8220;would all be done on an envelope&#8221; on disposal.  He says he has lived there longer than expected and that is why it still has not been addressed.  He said that there is currently a balance of around &#163;82,000 owing back to Mr Brook and that that is going to increase the longer that he stays there and therefore, they are foregoing a rental income.   </p>

He is a good friend of the husband and he is clear that he wants to support him.  The husband is equally clear that Mr Brook has never cheated him in their dealings.

It is mutually beneficial for both to continue to offset expenditure or sums owed by one to the other in order to mitigate tax consequences.  I do not propose to adjust for any contingent sums potentially owing to Mr Brook as I consider they are likely to largely be extinguished by further capital or further adjustments.  Anything that would be paid would be significantly reduced by the sums that would be payable at the additional tax rate and that seems to me to be a very inefficient way of dealing with matters if it can be achieved by capital adjustments elsewhere. </p>

It seems to me that it is impossible to reconcile his discovery on the system of a contemporaneous draft showing the wife as the beneficiary with the production of a document with the husband as the beneficiary with no enquiries having been made by him to see if there was an executed copy of the document in anyone else&#8217;s possession.  He told me that as he did not have executed declaration of trust he regarded the husband as &#8220;free to start again&#8221;.  When asked about the swap to the husband&#8217;s name, he told me that he &#8220;did not think it mattered&#8221;.  He told me there was an honest belief that the document on the system was an unexecuted draft and that there was no concluded agreement.  In oral evidence, he then suggested that there were, in fact, multiple versions of the deed on his system which contrasted with his written evidence that &#8220;the document on the system was dated 7 December 2010 between [Ms E] and Jessie&#8221;.  </p>

But, as a property solicitor, Mr Brook must know exactly why it matters, who has the beneficial interest, what is the nature and extent of their interest, and what are the tax consequences of those ownership arrangements?  Far from being academic, it seems to me to be absolutely fundamental when one is dealing with an interest in property.  Ascertaining current ownership is an absolutely fundamental starting point from which other legal consequences then flow and that is why I say that his approach to this crucial issue is illustrative of the very grave concerns I have and the difficulties that arise from his evidence. </p>

An amended schedule was subsequently produced by Mr F&#8217;s in-house accountant.  It seemed to me this aspect of Mr Brook&#8217;s evidence was uncharacteristically specific given the vagueness in other areas of his evidence, that he appears to have had a discussion about the payment being capital and not interest, but not at the husband&#8217;s instigation, when this could potentially be financially disadvantageous to the husband.  Whilst payment of interest would, indeed, generate a tax bill, it would also mean a higher ongoing income stream.

It is described as having been in immaculate condition and sold for &#163;6.75 million in 2018.  It is slightly smaller than the matrimonial home at 3,500 sq. ft.  That would give it a value per square foot of between &#163;1,800 and &#163;1,900.  Mr Carrelli thought that given it was semi-detached and had no private driveway or security features, this helped to prove that his valuation was more reliable.  Mr Asbury described this as being a more stylish and more modern property with much wider market appeal and he said that there was therefore a valid reason to distinguish.  Mr Asbury felt that the comparables indicated a price per square foot of &#163;1,300 or thereabouts.  He felt that that is where the matrimonial home sits in the market as a whole.  Mr Carrelli felt that something in the order of &#163;1,900 per sq. ft. would be around the right mark.   </p>

There was an obvious logic that refurbishing a property into a turn-key house would enhance its value although the house would probably not be liveable while any such refurbishment was being carried out and he said that, because of that, that is why there is value to a purchaser to avoid a hassle factor and not everybody would be attracted to the idea of that significant level of work.  He thought the value is reduced by more, therefore, than the costs of doing those works.   </p>

Mr Asbury confirmed that he had previously worked in the Swiss Cottage area when working for Chestertons and that he was very familiar with the area, although he now works covering a number of prime postcodes including NW3 and NW8.  Both valuers, it seemed to me, had considerable expertise in respect of properties in that area but Mr Asbury had rather more understanding of the role of an expert within matrimonial proceedings.  Mr Carrelli confirmed that a large part of his experience is in doing statutory valuations.  Hence, he had asked for a valuation date at one point.  That, of course, is a different exercise to valuing for matrimonial proceedings.  It is also a matter of concern that he took with him the agent who </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Mr Carrelli confirmed that his provisional view is that the house would be worth over &#163;7 million before he had seen the property.   He thought that at value of around &#163;2,000 per sq. ft. a property of approximately 4,000 sq. ft. would be worth around &#163;8 million.  My concern on hearing his evidence was that he had become somewhat entrenched in that view.  Unlike Mr Asbury, Mr Carrelli was unable to acknowledge that there was any factor that would impact on the desirability of this property and therefore its value.  I accept Mr Asbury&#8217;s evidence that it is not on one of the prime roads, that there is potentially limited scope to extend which might concern a number of potential purchasers, it is of a different style to other properties in the area, and it is overlooked in the sense that it is built perpendicular to other adjacent properties.  Mr Asbury was quite clear that when he went into the garden the property was, in his view, overlooked.  I do not accept that he was mistaken in that regard.  He described it as having a &#8220;goldfish bowl&#8221; feeling.  Mr Carrelli viewed it in a different month.  It may have been less apparent.  However, I consider Mr Asbury as being far more measured and realistic in considering what would impact on potential buyers viewing this property and he has considered the negatives as well as the positives.  Mr Carrelli was simply not willing to countenance that there was anything negative about this property and has barely moved from his initial estimate.  He has produced a very select number of comparables, a significant number of which are either better located or in a better condition. </p>

Mr Carrelli had to acknowledge that there would be nuances in the patches shown on the maps.  It does not assist me to know what the average is, or what the optimum sale price might be.  I need to know the realistic sale price for this property looking at the current market.  Mr Carrelli complained that Mr Asbury was throwing everything in and pulling up discrepancies in valuation but I reject that analysis. </p>

His formulaic approach of adjusting values, it seemed to me, did not necessarily factor in the significance of a property&#8217;s location when he himself acknowledged that being on one side or other of a particular road could make a significance difference.  I am satisfied that the former matrimonial home is an unusual property that would be being sold in a challenging market.  The FMH is in a road which does not have the calibre and prestige of other roads.  I accept Mr Asbury&#8217;s evidence that the problem is that in a weak market, if something is a bit off putting, people will go and buy something else.  All of those aspects seem to me to have been disregarded by Mr Carrelli.  He was of the provisional view that the property was worth &#163;7 million to &#163;8 million.

There is a willingness on the wife&#8217;s part to make progress but that is going to be constrained by the impact of her condition.
