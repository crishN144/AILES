On that date a district judge made an order prohibiting the mother from removing the child from England and Wales until further order.  The express purpose of the father&#8217;s application was to prevent the return of the child to Spain on 11 September 2011, with a view to the child remaining here and going to school here in September.  The district judge fixed a further hearing date for 12 September 2011.  </span></p>

The circuit judge accordingly stayed the proceedings in the Portsmouth County Court.  The prohibited steps order was discharged on the mother&#8217;s undertaking not to remove the child from England and Wales until further order (save for certain agreed periods of contact in Spain).  </span></p>

If he was so resident, then there was a wrongful retention and I must order his return forthwith.  If he was not so resident, then the convention is not engaged at all although both parents may, of course, pursue a range of other remedies under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  </span></p>

After discussion between the parents the father decided, with the agreement of the mother, to accept the offer.  Both parents agreed that it afforded a good opportunity for Pedro to learn some English, immersed in an English school, and generally that it would be an enriching experience for all of them.  The mother&#8217;s employers in Spain granted her express voluntary leave of absence from 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2011 by reference to various workers&#8217; rights as recorded in the document now at bundle page B14 (here and generally I refer to the page of the English translation of any Spanish documents).

So the first question is:  Did they, and specifically he, ever cease to be so resident?  I address and rule upon that question at this point in the narrative since, if he did ever cease to be habitually resident in Spain, he had ceased to be so resident earlier than 5 July 2011 (the date I have now reached in the narrative).  If he was still habitually resident in Spain on and up to 4 July 2011, then nothing which happened thereafter could possibly have subsequently terminated his continued habitual resident in Spain.  Conversely, if he was not habitually resident in Spain on 4 July 2011, then he could not have become habitually resident there again before (at the earliest) late July 2011, as I will later explain.  </span></p>

It is perfectly possible for a person not to be habitually resident anywhere.  Indeed, as habitual residence in one country may cease the moment a person leaves that country with no intention of returning to live there, but acquisition of habitual residence in another country requires residence there for an &#8220;appreciable&#8221; period (even if that period may sometimes be short), it may frequently happen that during the &#8220;appreciable period&#8221; the person is not habitually resident anywhere.  Nomads, round the world yachtsmen, and students on a long gap year may also have no habitual residence for substantial periods of time.  That said, both counsel have, on the facts of this case, treated the issue of loss of habitual residence in Spain as being binary with the question whether Pedro ever became habitually resident in England.  </span></p>

It is not of course necessary to identify any particular date when the change occurred.  The question at this stage of this judgment is: Did the parents and Pedro at some stage prior to 5 July 2011 cease to be habitually resident in Spain and become, at that stage and during that period, habitually resident here?  </span></p>

When the mother bought the return tickets from England to Spain and back on 23 June 2011, she was clearly doing so at that stage on the basis of a holiday period only, before the father resumed work in England in early August and she and Pedro resumed work or school here in September.  </span></p>

Many family and friends, and what Miss Renton called the &#8220;support network&#8221;, remain in Spain.  The parties retained their properties (and one car) there, and merely rented, and in the event never purchased, a property in England.  Although registered with a GP practice here, the parties and Pedro remained registered also in Spain, and it was on visits to Spain that Pedro had his MMR vaccination and some dental treatment or check-ups.  The parties remained registered on the municipal census/electoral register in Spain.

It was very illuminating.  I observed, as I have already recorded, that both parents are highly intelligent and articulate.  The mother needed some assistance from the interpreter, but was able also to understand many questions and give many answers in English.  Her evidence did not suffer from any lack of clarity in expression or comprehension.  However, as between the two of them, I have to record that her evidence was the less clear and reliable in her recollection, and was, to a degree, tinged by her now refashioning events in her mind as she would wish them to have been, rather than as they necessarily actually were.  </span></p>

She believed that he accepted that Pedro would live with her in Spain and go back to his old school there.

He had already received legal advice, as he has now told me, both in Spain and from England that the child was still habitually resident in England, and also that a court in Spain would be likely to be &#8220;more favourable&#8221; to the mother than would a court here.  He already had a plan, therefore, to wait until Pedro returned to England on 17 August 2011 and then to commence proceedings here, as he was later to do.  I think the father would have been very careful to use the conditional &#8220;if&#8221;, but also not to stress it.  He did not want to compromise his position by agreeing to Pedro remaining in Spain, but he was also very anxious, and very careful, not to do, or say, anything which might deter the mother from bringing Pedro back to England on 17 August 2011 as planned.  </span></p>

He very strongly and clearly desired at all material times that Pedro should remain living in England, either at home with him or at any rate nearby in a separate home with the mother, and he was (and remains) determined to achieve that if he can.  Second, I am in no doubt that the father never actually expressed his agreement or consent to the mother.  On the contrary, he was very careful indeed not to do so.  In the conversation about schools he was careful to use, although not to stress, the conditional &#8220;if&#8221;.  Third, I do not consider that the father did any act or omission in the period 25 July - 26 August 2011 (both dates inclusive) sufficient to create (if such be sufficient) a tacit consent.  The true reality of this very sad case is that, as I have already said, the parties left England on 16 July 2011 with nothing seriously discussed, nothing resolved and nothing agreed.  There were serious discussions in Spain, namely the four mediation sessions.  But, as the mother herself has accepted, they ended, not in agreement, but in a continuing absence of agreement.  It is no doubt true that the mother would never have returned with Pedro to England on 17 August 2011 if she had foreseen all that was to ensue.  It is, in my view, equally true that the father would never have travelled meekly to Spain with Pedro in July if he had foreseen all that was to ensue.  He had said at the end of his conditions document (now at bundle page B452): </span></p>

Rather, each of them was engaged in a degree of manoeuvring, including the mother when she asked the somewhat indirect question about choice of school in Spain rather than the head on, direct question as to whether Pedro would live in Spain or in England.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In my view, a conclusion that Pedro resumed his habitual residence in Spain in the period between 25 July 2011 (Miss Renton does not argue for any earlier date) and 17 August 2011 (upon which date he again became physically present in England) would indeed involve unilateral change by the mother and flies in the face of the realities of this case.  In my view, his habitual residence in England persists to this day.  But, even if that is not the case, I am not persuaded that on or before 26 August 2011 Pedro was habitually resident in Spain.  It follows that the application under the Hague Convention must be dismissed.  </span></p>
