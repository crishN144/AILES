	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none">I am concerned with three children, N now aged 15; P now aged 14 and T now aged nine. On Friday, 8 December 2017 Sussex police applied without notice to the urgent applications judge at the High Court for a forced marriage protection order in respect of all three children. That order was granted including a direction that the respondents were to immediately make travel arrangements for N and T to return to the jurisdiction of England and Wales within 48 hours of service of this order. The respondents to that application were F, the children&#8217;s father; M, the children&#8217;s mother and C, the children&#8217;s aunt. The order was served at about 6:30 PM on Friday evening and thus the children were required to return by about 6.30pm on Sunday 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December.  P was taken into police protection on 8 December and placed in foster care. The girls did not return by that deadline but they were returned by 15 December. They were met at the airport by police and social workers and placed in foster care. The parents agreed to them being accommodated pursuant to section 20 Children act 1989 and on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> of December 2017 West Sussex County Council commenced care proceedings. Those proceedings were transferred to the High Court on 3 January 2018 and his honour Judge Thorpe made an interim care order in respect of each of the three children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none">I would like to thank the parties and their legal teams for the immense effort that has gone into preparing this case. The documentary evidence runs across six lever arch files. The arrangements for the witnesses to give evidence have been far from straightforward. N and P were the subject of ground rules hearings and directions based on the recommendations of Dr Latif. That was supplemented by the advice of specialist intermediaries. They both gave evidence by video link and arrangements were made for them to be notified of the topics on which they would be questioned and to limit the number of counsel who would ask them questions. Q, the mother&#8217;s sister, also gave evidence. It had become clear at the end of May that she was the individual who had provided much information to the police on which the application had been based. She had been treated by the police as an informant. Considerable care had been taken by the police to preserve her anonymity. Following a hearing in April of this year when I invited the police to consider whether in the context of what was already known (or very strongly suspected) and when her evidence would be a central component of this fact-finding hearing, whether they wished to seek to maintain her anonymity, the police, very sensibly in my view on the particular facts of this case, decided that they did not seek to maintain her anonymity and thus that special advocates would not be required to deal with the evidence as it related to her. However, she was treated by this court as a vulnerable witness and arrangements were made for her to give evidence by video link from a secure location. Regrettably Q did not cooperate with those arrangements and under considerable pressure was brought to London to give evidence from the vulnerable witness suite here. A further local authority witness O also had to give evidence by video link, she only having returned from holiday in the morning of the fourth day of the hearing. Happily, despite some early technical difficulties with the link, all of the witnesses have been able to give their evidence in an uninterrupted and effective way. The special measures taken and implemented by the parties and the court have in this case worked very effectively.</p>

They say the girls could not return alone and were entered in education. Whilst the mother was there she decided that the environment was better for her health and that she would seek to make a long-term home there. Both parents deny that the children&#8217;s presence in Pakistan was in any way linked to the local authority investigation. The mother says that she was in the process of saving money to pay for N&#8217;s return flight.

The parents deny this and assert that the children&#8217;s allegations were untrue and the product of the influence of two maternal aunts but in particular of Q to whom the children had grown close. They maintain that Q bears a grudge in particular against the father because of the circumstances in which they married and that over the course of the marriage Q has made unfounded allegations against the father of drinking, drug use and infidelity which have been the root cause of arguments within their marriage.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none">N&#8217;s position since she gave a retraction interview in February 2018 has been that all of the allegations she made in her ABE interview were false. She says that she very much wanted to come home from Pakistan and made the allegation that she was engaged to be married in order to get back to England. She says that she made the allegations about physical and verbal abuse because she was led to believe by DC Cherryman that if she gave lots of detail in support of the allegations that she would be able to go home to her parents. Mr Cassidy has submitted that the circumstances in which her allegations were recorded and in particular the circumstances in which the ABE interview was undertaken were in breach of the MOJ guidance and that taken together with the inducements offered to her are such as to render the allegations made wholly unreliable. Mr Cassidy emphasises that N&#8217;s primary desire is to return to live with her family. Mr Cassidy said in submissions that N feels a responsibility for setting in train events which led to the situation the family now find themselves in. I would like N to know that she is emphatically not responsible for this situation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none">P also no longer holds by the allegations he made prior to December 2017 or in his ABE interview. Mr Belben on his behalf says that he was desperate to secure the return of his sisters from Pakistan and said what he considered needed to be said to get them back; what he did was an honourable thing. He accepts that what he said was not true and he also wishes to return home. I agree that what P did was motivated by concern for his sisters and by his own desire to be reunited with them. That was a perfectly proper motive. If he &#8216;overcooked&#8217; the allegations he made that is not a surprise. No one in his immediate family was listening to he or his sisters and in response he was effectively forced to take more and more radical action. He does not bear responsibility for the situation the family finds itself in. I&#8217;m sure he might wish to reflect on the impact of some of his more extreme allegations but I cannot blame him at all for acting as he did.  When children and young people are not listened to on such serious issues as those engaged here the adults around them should not be surprised and certainly should not blame them if the children resort to extreme measures to make their voices heard.</p>

The subject matter itself is highly sensitive. In every case, as it seems to me, a clear distinction needs to be drawn between, on the one hand, forced marriage as a form of domestic violence and a serious abuse of human rights, and, on the other, the concept of the consensual arranged marriage which is rightly perceived as a cultural norm in certain societies and thus wholly acceptable: - see, for example the decision of Singer J in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re SK </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/3202" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 3202 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 3202 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 230" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 230</ref> <span class="None" style="font-style:italic">and that of Munby J (as he then was) in </span><span class="None" style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re K </span><span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/2956" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 2956 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 2956 (Fam)</ref></span><span/><span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 399" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 399</ref></span><span class="None" style="font-style:italic">.</span></p>

The first is that it is very widely drawn. It is extra-territorial in its application and orders may be both made and discharged ex parte. Secondly, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> plainly creates a protective / injunctive jurisdiction. Its object is to prevent forced marriages by protecting those who may be, or have been, forced into marriage. The position in relation to respondents, moreover, seems to me robust, and the only criterion for protecting a respondent to such an order appears in section 63D(3), where the order is made ex parte and the court is required to give any respondent "an opportunity to make representations" (see section 63D(3)). That opportunity must be "as soon as just and convenient" (section 63D4(a)) and at an "on notice" hearing (section 63D4(b)). The order otherwise lasts until varied or discharged (63F). </span></p>

In such circumstances, I fully recognise that factual issues may arise which the court is required to investigate. However, not only is that not this case, but, even if it were, it does not seem to me that that special advocates have any role to play. The police - or the alleged victim &#8211; argue that certain information likely to lead to a breach of the rights provided by ECHR Articles 2, 3 or 8 should not be disclosed. Balanced against that are the ECHR Article 6 (and possibly 8) rights of the persons subject to the order. Given the protective nature of the court's jurisdiction, it seems to me that the court can decide the issue of whether or not the order should stand without either detailed investigation of the factual issues or the intervention of special advocates.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none">Given that such orders carry penal consequences and not just on contempt but criminal law penalties where a person might be arrested on the basis of there existing reasonable grounds to suspect them of being in breach and being charged on the basis of a realistic prospect of conviction it is clear the making of an interim ex parte order is a very serious step with potentially very significant consequences for the respondents. This is a case in point. Without notice orders were made on Friday morning, served at 6:30 PM on Friday evening with a requirement that the two girls be returned within 48 hours of service. The order did contain a warning including the fact that they had a right to apply to the court to change or cancel the order. The warning stated in bold failure to obey this order is a serious criminal offence. Thus, as of 6:30 PM on Sunday evening, the parents without having had the opportunity to consult lawyers or to make an application back to the court were at risk of arrest for breach of the order. Given the concerns expressed by P in his telephone call of 7 December it is hardly a surprise that the application was made on an urgent basis and was granted on an urgent basis. The difference between the sorts of orders that the President was discussing in that case and this is that he was referring purely to protective and prohibitory orders which prevented a forced marriage and which could not be seriously objected to, purely requiring the respondents to refrain from doing things. When mandatory orders are concerned which require a person to do an act, in this case requiring the return of children from Pakistan in circumstances where they had been there for 16 months that is clearly a far more significant matter. It clearly involves a positive interference with the family life of the respondents and therefore has article 6 ECHR implications which rights the President concluded were not engaged when the court was simply making prohibitory orders.  Where mandatory orders are sought, whilst the section 63A criteria still apply (I assume for these purposes a return order falls within the definition of &#8216;requirement&#8217;) it seems to me that the court must be satisfied on appropriate evidence that the making of such an order is a necessary and proportionate response. Where the order is to bite almost immediately and in circumstances where the respondents will be placed under an obligation carrying potentially penal consequences before they will in practical terms be able to seek legal advice or return the matter to court the approach of those applying for the injunction and the court considering it will necessarily need to be that much more robust.</p>

The respondents were not seeking its discharge. It does not appear that there were linked care proceedings which do require findings to be made on issues which are common to both sets of proceedings.  The determination of the factual issues in this case will of course inform the exercise of the court&#8217;s powers in relation to the forced marriage protection order. I should note that neither of the parents are actively seeking its discharge. It is their case that they have never sought to force N into a marriage and will not do so.</p>

The position in relation to evidence contained within ABE interviews was considered by the Court of Appeal in Re E (a child) (evidence) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2016/473" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCA Civ 473" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCA Civ 473</ref>. Lord Justice McFarlane in that case said that the departures from the ABE guidance required the judge to engage with a thorough analysis of the process in order to evaluate whether any of the allegations that the children made to the police could be relied upon. It is clear from that decision that what the child says within such an interview is admissible. The issue that the court must grapple with is whether it can be relied upon. In that case the evidence was of sexual abuse and formed the dominant part of the evidence on which the case hinged.  Both Ms Chowdhury and Mr Cassidy invite me to conclude that the evidence contained within the December ABE interviews is entirely unreliable and is rendered so by the failure to preplan the interview, to ask for a short summary of the child position at the outset, by the failure of DC Cherryman to maintain an appropriate &#8216;distance&#8217; from N and by the circumstances in which the interviews were carried out. They say that the combination of factors in this case are such that the entirety of the interviews are rendered unreliable as evidenced by the children subsequent retractions of them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in;border:none">A very considerable difficulty in this case in my view is that all of those who have been able to give a direct account of events which form the foundation of both the threshold and the forced marriage allegations have not given accounts on which I feel confident in relying. In respect of N and P self-evidently they have given diametrically opposite accounts. In respect of both the mother and father they clearly have a motive to minimise or deny what happened and the evidence clearly demonstrates that in some respects they have not been truthful. In respect of Q she has clearly become so angry and frustrated that her oral evidence was tinged with this. In respect of her written statements there were clearly aspects which were difficult to accept; her assertion that the father had engaged his daughters for financial gain and that she had been aware of an engagement but had never spoken to either her mother or her sisters about N&#8217;s engagement because she was not of that culture were particular examples. Although DC Cherryman I&#8217;m satisfied gave me honest evidence, the contemporaneous documentary evidence which would often be found in a police investigation was not present. He did not have notes made of his conversations with N in anything other than the most perfunctory form in respect of 13 October conversation. In respect even of that, the way the note reads suggests that in fact that is a note of his conversation with Q not of his conversation with N. He quite frankly accepted that he had not made many notes of his conversations with N. Given the allegations that have now been made against him in terms of his reassurances that N would be able to go home and the suggestion that she should make up detail that is unfortunate from his point of view. It is also unfortunate from this court&#8217;s point of view and from the family&#8217;s point of view. The whole purpose of contemporaneous notes is to seek to enable the court the parties and the police to have a reliable record of what took place. DC Cherryman&#8217;s explanation that he did not like to interrupt the flow by taking truly contemporaneous notes is understandable. Writing up the notes afterwards though would have been possible. I got the impression from DC Cherryman that the very many demands on his time was probably the underlying explanation for the lack of record-keeping. He himself was unable to recall whether the photograph at G 19 was showing the engagement ceremony or was merely for identification purposes. On balance he thought it was for identification purposes although it is clear from Q&#8217;s statement and the fact that the photographs were provided on 13 October 2017 that it is more likely that it was provided by Q to show the ceremony, even if originally it was provided to Q by N to show her what B looked like. Nor is the documentary evidence in any sense complete. Police records in relation to the complaints of domestic violence are not present. There is no evidence from P&#8217;s school as to his conversations with them about N&#8217;s situation. There is no record from the FCO, forced marriage protection unit of their involvement, save for the note of the conversation when P rang them on 7 December. In particular there is not a note of their visit to N in about October 2016.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in;border:none">The mother gave evidence in a combative and defiant fashion. She often resorted to saying she did not want to comment on a matter or did not want to answer a question. She is clearly a forceful personality and is determined to have her say and I think get her way.  That she married the father without discussion with her father and without inviting her sisters demonstrates that she will do what is necessary to get what she wants.  Her denial of what she said about domestic violence and the father&#8217;s anger was not at all convincing. Many aspects of her answers were unconvincing or evasive. Her explanation for why N could not come back to England in September 2016 when she had a ticket and was due to return to school was implausible. Her account of why they remained in Pakistan and how she came to decide that she would not return to live in England but make her home in Pakistan again was unconvincing. Her evidence in relation to the telephone in the house was frankly risible.  I am afraid she was a far from impressive witness. At times obstructive, defensive, self-entitled, self-centred and argumentative. She demonstrated an almost complete absence of insight into the impact of events on her children and seemed to accept no responsibility for anything that occurred. The Guardian observed that there was no trace of emotion or connection with the children and I am inclined to agree although this may have been the environment as the contact notes and the assessment of Dr Latif suggest that the children are attached to her and she to them.  In respect of any matter which might reflect badly on her I&#8217;m satisfied that I cannot rely on her unless her evidence is corroborated by independent and contemporaneous evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in;border:none">In the witness box the father was generally measured and attempted to answer the questions asked of him more fully than the mother had. He resorted less to no comment. In consequence of being less guarded he found it very difficult to give a clear explanation in relation to one of the central issues; namely whether N and B were girlfriend/boyfriend or engaged. His explanation that culturally such a relationship would be effectively taboo and so he tried to discourage it did not sit well with his written statement that due to N&#8217;s persistence they had eventually told friends and family that B and N were boyfriend girlfriend. His account of never having spoken to E about her numerous conversations with N did not ring true but felt like a rehearsed script. Nor did I think he was being frank when he spoke about the extent of the domestic arguments or his treatment of the children. His evidence smacked of minimisation. Saying that he and the mother sat down to discuss issues but perhaps in loud voices flies in the face both of the other accumulated evidence in this case, this court&#8217;s experience in general and also the characters of the mother and father. It is clear, from the body worn video, that the father tends to hold his feelings in until they reach a point when they erupt. That he is capable of behaving angrily and noisily in front of uniformed police and others suggests that away from the eye of authority he would be capable of behaving in this way at the very least; probably he would be less restrained. On the other hand, aspects of his evidence appeared to have a ring of truth about them. He spoke, I thought, sincerely about the value of education. I also thought he spoke sincerely about what was said to him by N and T when he was in Pakistan for E&#8217;s wedding. He also seemed unable to relate to how the children may have felt about being separated although he at least appeared to recognise that they would have been distressed by witnessing arguments between their parents. In respect of the father he came across generally as a much more reserved individual who does not cope easily with his emotions. In respect of the central allegations therefore I am satisfied that the father was not telling the whole truth and in some respects was either minimising what had happened or being untruthful.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in;border:none">N&#8217;s ABE interview I have summarised in the chronology. She comes across as more composed and coherent than P. Her account of her family and life in the family home is more spontaneous and coherent. It has a ring of authenticity to it. For reasons which I am not entirely clear about there is a pause in the interview when DC Cherryman and N go outside. When the tape recommences DC Cherryman says that N has asked how much information she needs to give and that he has told her to give as much information as possible and as she is comfortable with. Mr Cassidy links this to N&#8217;s belief that if she gave sufficient information she would be able to go home. N now says that in effect she was tricked into giving a false narrative on the promise that she would then be allowed to return to her parents. Having seen DC Cherryman give evidence I&#8217;m satisfied that he did not in any way hold out such an offer to N. I am concerned though that he allowed himself to become too close emotionally to N and that this may have caused him to be less frank with her than he ought to have been. Given the level of distress that she was in, which emerges clearly from the foster carers notes and given what he said about seeking to reassure her I can see that N may have got an impression that she was likely to go home even if DC Cherryman did not intend to create that impression. The break in the interview and that unrecorded discussion outside together with the absence of a plan to tend to undermine the reliability of what was said. On the other hand, as Ms Taylor points out this was not an instance where N was led. The picture which emerges from the interview is of aspects which appear to be truthful and reliable and other aspects of which I&#8217;m more doubtful. </p>

She said &#8216;I just want to take the allegations back and I request to apologise for all of this to the judge and I really want to go home&#8230;&#8217; I don&#8217;t have any issues with them [my parents]. She tells the police she has had no contact with her parents other than face-to-face with supervisors. She denied her account of domestic life had been true and said all of that was false and suggested that DC Cherryman told her to put really bad details in so that they could go home. She maintained that Q knew the truth which was that none of it was true.  Given her demeanour it is hard to know what to make of this interview. There is little that can be inferred from her body language.</p>

She said her second interview was the truth. There were moments in her evidence when she spoke about unconnected matters which seemed more spontaneous and authentic. Her account of struggling in school because it was taught in Urdu was clearly in my view genuine. Likewise, her description of the house in Pakistan and some aspects of life there. In other respects such as when asked about her parents she was keen to absolve them of any responsibility for anything that occurred. Much of the rest of her evidence though simply consisted in her confirming things she had said in interview and then denying their truth. Mr Cameron was unable to really make any inroads into her account though she did accept that she had had telephone calls with her mother after she went into foster care and that they had happened without the foster carer knowing. She clearly was stressed and anxious and needed a break as she was starting to get a migraine.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in;border:none">P&#8217;s ABE interview was undertaken on 12 December 2017 when N was still in Pakistan. It lasted 73 minutes. Having gone through the standard introductions illustrating he understood the difference between truth and lies he almost immediately made an allegation that B had sexually abused N every day and that B&#8217;s younger brother had sexually abused T and that he had told them not to do it again. Both of these allegations I&#8217;m satisfied are untrue. It is during this part of the interview that he makes the allegation that he heard his father calling his mother suggesting that they get N married &#8216;this Friday&#8217;. He gave varying accounts of whether he heard his mum or not precisely what was said and where and how it was said. His interview varies from saying he never spoke to N about the engagement to say she normally shares everything with him. Midway through the interview he refers almost as an aside to his Nan having mentioned that his dad had said he would get married to (B&#8217;s sister) but he quickly moved on from that subject. P jumps from subject to subject at one point the police officer says <span class="None" style="font-style:italic">I just need to, so I don&#8217;t get this confused in my head I&#8217;m just going to take you over what you&#8217;ve told me quite slowly P if that&#8217;s all right</span>.  In contrast his account of being hit by his father at the shops was more coherent and detailed, likewise his account of the conversations with N once the court order was made. These are of course corroborated either by the father or by the WhatsApp messages.</p>

His evidence largely consisted of agreeing that he had said things in the ABE interview and then saying that he made up the details because he thought it would help get the girls home. He maintained his composure, indeed I thought he was very anxious and that made his delivery quite wooden. There were very few moments of spontaneity - when he spoke of going to Pakistan for E&#8217;s wedding and seeing N and T, he livened up. In his evidence he made what I thought was a most unlikely allegation that O had promised him that if he told the Guardian he didn&#8217;t want to go home that she would let him have the Internet all night.  </p>

This emerges from the chronology historically and more recently.  It has found expression in this case in serious allegations of sexual abuse given with some detail which appear according to N and T to have no foundation at all. For the purposes of this hearing it means I need to be cautious about P&#8217;s evidence where it is not corroborated by someone else or something independent or contemporaneous. What is more concerning is how he has developed this habit. Having seen the mother and father give evidence P may well have learnt from them that not telling the truth is acceptable behaviour.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in;border:none">The circumstances in which Q came to give evidence were far from conducive to her giving an impartial and balanced account. She had wanted to retain her anonymity and is plainly extremely cross with the local authority and the court for having confirmed the parents&#8217; suspicions as to the source of much of the information that the police obtained. Attempts to avoid coming to give evidence illustrate both her anger but also a lack of regard for the legal process. When she did give evidence, she was combative in the extreme. Like her sister she clearly has a very strong personality and is used to holding her own and indeed getting her own way. She clearly does have a grudge with her sister and with the father. She clearly is capable of hyperbole and the construction of explanations without an evidential basis. However, notwithstanding the deficiencies in the way in which she gave evidence I&#8217;m satisfied that there was a core of truth to them. I do not accept that any animus towards the mother or father was to such a degree that she effectively created this whole situation. It seems clear that the children turned to her for support along with their other aunt G. Why would they do this unless there was a problem with their parents. Why would Q or G contact the authorities with concerns about N becoming engaged unless there was something on the family grapevine to that effect. The parents own account corroborates that there being a situation in which their 13-year-old daughter was being linked to an older cousin. Perhaps it was G who contacted the NSPCC in May 2017; N&#8217;s phone records show frequent contact with both M and G after her return. Had Q really been fabricating the whole story she would have given it much more embellishment. I thought she was telling the truth when she said that there had been no conversations in October 2017 about N getting married next. Equally she was probably telling the truth when she said there had been no intra-family discussions about the engagement. A fabricated forced marriage would have gone further in its extent and detail than Q gave. Somewhat surprisingly perhaps she emerges (other than O) as the most reliable witness.</p>

I&#8217;m satisfied that DC Cherryman is an honest witness. However because his record-keeping was poor and because we are now some eight months on from events his recollection was at times patchy. He accepted with hindsight that aspect of the investigation could have been better handled. Given the expectations of a professional police witness and the problems with his record-keeping and recollection his evidence was not as reliable as it should have been or could have been. That is far from saying, as is alleged by N that he deliberately or knowingly misled her. At worst he may have allowed his sympathy for N&#8217;s plight as a distressed child to bring out his protective instincts in a way which resulted in him being closer than was ideal. </p>

This is of course only part of the picture. I would like to put down a marker at this stage though that from what I have seen of the children and what I have read about the parents and what I&#8217;ve seen of them that they do have qualities as parents. In their interviews and in evidence the children were polite and cooperative. T in particular came across as an appropriately naive, confident and open little girl. No parents are perfect. Some are very good. Some are very bad indeed. Most fall between the extremes either because of their personalities or life circumstances. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="border:none"><span class="None" style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">The contemporaneous evidence taken together with the parents&#8217; admissions and what the children said in their ABE interviews satisfy me that the atmosphere in the household was at times toxic and on two occasions spilled over into physical violence perpetrated by the father on the mother. The mother&#8217;s denial of the account given by her at F 78 was not convincing. Her reasons for denying what she had said, namely the father&#8217;s name was wrong and the children couldn&#8217;t have said they were pleased when the father went out because he was no longer living there appeared to me to be desperate attempts to avoid the reality of what she had said. Her account of the father becoming very angry with the children is consistent with what the children have said. I&#8217;m satisfied that regular and very heated arguments took place between the parents in which they abused each other. These took place with the children in the home and the children were scared by them. It seems likely that the children&#8217;s behaviour towards each other and towards their parents was at least in part a product of seeing and hearing their parents arguing in the most heated terms. The concerns expressed by P&#8217;s school about his attitude to girls and disrespect for women teachers suggests he witnessed behaviour at home from which he learned. For the mother to call the police because the father had lost his temper and she was worried about what he would do illustrates the severity of the situation.  From seeing the mother and father&#8217;s response to the service of the FMPO and having seen them give evidence I&#8217;m satisfied that both of them are capable of loud and angry outbursts. Having said that whilst this was undoubtedly unpleasant and scary for the mother and particularly the children on the spectrum of domestic abuse this was at the lower end of the spectrum. I do not conclude that there was physical violence used save in isolated incidents; If there had been I am sure the children would have spoken of it and I think the mother and Q would have done. The mother did not suffer physical injury, she does not appear to have suffered particular psychological harm. She was robust in her evidence, is capable of standing up for herself, and I do not get the overall impression of a significant power imbalance in the relationship between the mother and father.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;border:none"><span class="None">As I&#8217;ve said before the situation in the household was at times toxic and dysfunctional. Perhaps there were financial difficulties, perhaps the mother&#8217;s ill-health, perhaps the children&#8217;s poor behaviour all contributed to a very stressful situation. Given that I&#8217;m satisfied that both parents are capable of losing their temper it takes little imagination to see them at times transferring their anger and taking this out on the children. The account of the children being quiet because they were fearful of their father, the children&#8217;s account of the father ejecting them from the house, slapping them when they were being noisy after a night shift, the father punching P to the shoulder and causing a red mark, the mother slapping P for coming in with muddy feet all I&#8217;m satisfied are true. The details of the accounts given by P and N both seemed spontaneous; P&#8217;s account of the shops incidents was close in detail to what the father himself said about it save he denied any force. The evidence from T in 2016 from her school about her anxiety and other historical records all corroborate what the children say.  I&#8217;m satisfied that much of this went beyond what some people might consider to be reasonable physical chastisement within a parent-child relationship because of its pervasive nature not because of the level of force used or injury inflicted. Given there is no evidence of any injury amounting to ABH &#8211; save possibly the redness and swelling P described would satisfy that criteria - it would not constitute an offence. Some of it fell within the boundaries of reasonable physical chastisement. See Archbold 19-237. Given the children themselves speak of being hit only on rare occasions and the language they used (&#8216;beaten up&#8217;) they modified on clarification being sought I am satisfied that physical violence was isolated. However, I am satisfied that at times and for lengthy periods (although not all the time) the children walked on eggshells in the house particularly around their father but that also their mother was capable of taking out her anger on them in a way which went beyond ordinary parent/child scolding or telling off. This like the domestic abuse was at the lower end of the spectrum.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="border:none"><span class="None" style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">I do not accept that a 72% attendance rate is solely due to N hiding in the toilet having gone to school. The low attendance would have been raised by the school far earlier than her attendance hitting 72% and the parents were aware of an issue. Both sought to shift responsibility from themselves to N. It seems to me that her lack of attendance was a combination of the dysfunctional situation at home and its impact on her together with a lack of commitment by the parents to getting N to school. Perhaps they simply had too much to cope with. Perhaps the mother welcomed N being at home to assist with the chores. The father had not been living in the home for a period prior to April 2016 when he became the mother&#8217;s full-time carer and it seems likely from what N said &#8211; indeed what all the children said to social services in the period 2013-16 that the mother struggled to cope on her own. E emerges as a strong personality &#8211; like her mother perhaps &#8211; determined to do as she chose and N may being less assertive and younger have picked up the burden of helping the mother. In any event there was a failure to prioritise N&#8217;s education in the way that it should have been. I am satisfied that the father did and does value education; curiously the mother seems not to. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;border:none"><span class="None">It is clear that P&#8217;s behaviour at school and at home has been a problem for some time. Both the mother and father downplayed this. It seems likely that this is a product of the dysfunctional household that he lived in. Given the mother and children had all expressed concerns about the father&#8217;s strict approach to discipline which as I have found converted into excessive discipline it must have been something of a surprise to P that he ended up living with his father without his mother and sisters. The pre-existing behaviour must have been compounded by the separation from N and from T and from his mother. It must have been very hard for him to understand why his mother had not returned from Pakistan particularly given he does not believe that she is as ill as she claims. The father was left in England seeking to bring P up along with E whilst the mother N and T remained in Pakistan. I&#8217;m satisfied that the father was unable to cope with P and hence he moved to live with H and G.  There is nothing wrong per se with P being cared for by relatives; not only is it common across cultures when parents are struggling to cope it is a sensible response. The problem in this case is both that the father did not reach out for help to keep P at home and failed to understand that a further separation from his father and E might be harmful but that was in combination with a separation from N and T. Given the father was not working and was not caring for the mother he had little calls upon his time and yet could not find a way to help to P and was not prepared then to ask for help from the authorities. I did not detect any empathy or understanding from the mother or father about P&#8217;s position.   </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="border:none"><span class="None" style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">It is certainly the case that the local authority was involved with the family in the summer of 2016. In April T expressed concerns about her father to her infant school. A child and family assessment was completed in July 2016. The mother and N and T travelled to Pakistan for a family wedding but did not return. The father said it was originally planned he would travel to the wedding of his nephew and given it was his blood relative the change in plan seems strange. The medical certificates confirm that the mother was unwell but I am not satisfied that this was the sole reason for her non-return. Her evidence about the medical situation and her operation was not at all convincing either as to the detail of her medical condition or its impact on her and her ability to travel. The medical certificates were produced for &#8216;administrative&#8217; purposes which the mother was not clear about &#8211; indeed I thought deliberately so. It seems most probable they were produced in relation to benefits claims as both the mother and father were existing solely on benefits from April 2016 and her absence from the jurisdiction for some 10 months would have called into question her eligibility for housing and other benefits and the father&#8217;s eligibility for a carers allowance.  In particular I am not satisfied that the mother&#8217;s medical condition was the reason for the girls&#8217; non-return. It seems to me most likely that a combination of factors persuaded the mother that it was better to remain in Pakistan. The ongoing difficulties in her relationship with the father, the background presence of the local authority, the calmer atmosphere generally in Pakistan compared to the home in England, her ill-health all combined to lead her to conclude that she would prefer to stay in Pakistan and more importantly that she would keep the girls in Pakistan. This it seems to me ultimately was a selfish decision. It meant leaving P alone in England. No arrangements were made for him to join her in Pakistan. She chose to keep N and T with her thus disrupting their education in England. The idea that it was sensible for N who already had educational difficulties in England to transfer into a school system using Urdu a language with which she was not familiar is farcical. If the mother had been medically incapable of travelling it was perfectly possible for the girls to return to England to re-join their older sister, their brother and their father and the relatives, including Nan who were there to care for them. The father was himself at home full time. It seems to me most probable that the mother chose to keep them there because she liked to have them around and would have been lonely on her own. N being able to help out around the house given her medical issues must have been a bonus. I&#8217;m satisfied that N became increasingly disenchanted with life in Pakistan. She was in school only for a short period of time and then studied beauty for three months she was then out of education for eight or nine months before returning to England. Life must have been fairly dull for a developing teenager. I&#8217;m satisfied that she wanted to come home and that her mother in particular but also her father knew of this but they had decided for their own reasons that it was better for the family to live like that for the time being. The mother&#8217;s evidence in relation to what she knew of N&#8217;s desires was wholly contradictory as between her oral evidence and her statement. Most likely N had regularly expressed a desire to return to England but had eventually given up.  The mother&#8217;s account of having promised N that she could come home when they got some money together after E&#8217;s wedding was another fobbing off. If N had been promised a return that could have been achieved by December, in particular given that the school holidays were as the mother told me in November. N could have been returned in September 2016, she could have returned with her mother in May 2017, she could have returned with family members after E&#8217;s wedding, she could have returned in November. She did not return because the family did not want her to return. They were returned only after the court order and following on family meetings in England and Pakistan.</span></p>

Regrettably this is in part because the evidence is far from complete in terms of what might have been obtained in terms of contemporaneous and particularly digital material. N&#8217;s and P&#8217;s phones which would have likely contained the records of the communications in WhatsApp or other digital media were not taken by the police and interrogated although P left the house on 8 December with his. N&#8217;s was not taken from her on her return &#8211; DC Cherryman said she was unhappy and he didn&#8217;t want to remove her phone and make her unhappier. He accepted in hindsight this was a poor decision. No questions were asked about the ring N claimed she had exchanged with B; an item which would physically corroborate her account was not asked for or asked about. Was it removed by the family? Did it ever exist? The contemporaneous material that exists is very limited in its extent; the messages shared between N and Q pre October 2017 and messages after the order was made. The contemporaneous material in terms of contact with authorities is also incomplete. The FCO records of the visit in October 2016 are not present. There is no material from P&#8217;s school although it seems in October 2016 that he raised an issue with his school counsellor about Turkey and it is likely it was this source that led to the concerns about N which led to the FCO inquiry.  E has not given evidence.  The one photograph which might relate to the issue is clouded in obscurity. DC Cherryman said he thought it did not show the ceremony but was simply to identify B. Q thought it showed the ceremony. The father and I thought his evidence on this was accurate was clear that it related to his nephew's wedding when B was a &#8216;best man&#8217; and he identified the individuals and location in such a way that this seemed genuine. N has never been asked about the picture; in neither ABE interview or in her evidence. So the picture is incomplete and the trail now cold.  Looking at all the material from the beginnings of the trail in September 2016 when the issue first emerged and the FCO visited, through to the NSPCC complaint through to Q&#8217;s contact with DC Cherryman on 13</span><span class="None" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> October 2017 it seems clear that there was an issue to do with N being engaged which someone in the family was concerned about.  The parents&#8217; case is that Q has fabricated all this out of grudge or spite. This I could understand if there had been nothing at all about N and a relationship and she was simply a 13 year old going to school. But the parents themselves accept there was an issue over N having a &#8216;relationship&#8217; with her cousin. So there is a kernel of accepted family history in something going on between B and N.  However was it truly an engagement in the sense of a formal commitment to marriage in the near future or something less?  N herself in her interview describes a formal ceremony but with no obligations. The parents describe something akin to a formal family acknowledgement that they were an item. However in cultural terms I don&#8217;t believe this amounted to anything like a relationship as I would understand it. It seems not to have involved any sort of actual relationship at all other than perhaps some social media contact and acquaintance through family contact. It seems probable that N met B at either the wedding or at E&#8217;s engagement and through the paternal family assisting the mother in her illness. I accept there was an issue over her medical condition because the children themselves spoke of it albeit saying she exaggerates it. She has obviously made a good recovery as she sat apparently without difficulty through 3 days of hearing and gave evidence without any sign of disability. Because the mother was in Pakistan in the bosom of the paternal family and reliant on them perhaps it suited her to enter a loose commitment or acknowledgement for N and B to perhaps marry in the future.  But a loose commitment I conclude it was.  N&#8217;s description of a ceremony seems to me to be given in a way which doesn&#8217;t speak of her recalling the emotions and details in a connected way   - a lived experience &#8211; as opposed to an observed experience and I am conscious this account is given almost immediately after the break where she asked about what level of detail to provide. If it had truly been an engagement &#8211; a welcome or very unwelcome one it would have been one of the most significant experiences in her life and her connection with the event and the associated emotions would have been more real. N herself spoke of the consequences only in the sense of very loose obligations; quite unlike a formal engagement. I am fortified in the conclusion that it was not a formal engagement by the fact that it left no footprint in the family. Q said she had never had cause to speak to her mother or her sister or anyone else about it. She said it was not a topic of conversation at E&#8217;s wedding. I think it beyond comprehension that if within this family there was an understanding that N was formally committed to a marriage (and she would hit the legal age in November 2018) that there was no reference to it in the celebrations of E&#8217;s wedding over several days.  Q says it was not mentioned and she asked no one. Neither P nor N say anything was said. Interesting T who I thought was entirely genuine and was artless when talking about her family, made absolutely no connection between B and N in her interview. No &#8216;he&#8217;s N&#8217;s boyfriend&#8217; or &#8216;they&#8217;re getting married&#8217;. Not a hint of connection between N and B; indeed T was clear and I again I though she was guileless &#8211; in saying boys and girls weren&#8217;t allowed to play together in Pakistan. So in terms of the close family the concept of N and B getting married had left no mark at all. If there was no formal engagement was that approaching a marriage in late 2017? The source of this suggestion is P. He spoke of a conversation when his father and mother were talking; The details of this are confusing. It is said to happen when in the car park at Tesco and he overhears it. At one point he says he can hear his mother say N at another he cannot hear the voice. His account appears to me to be inconsistent. He is the only source of a firm commitment to marry as far as I can tell. N in her interview says P told her he had overheard this. But by this time P was cranking up the level. He was saying he was subject to a risk of being forced into marriage. He said N and T were both being sexually abused. He said N was threatening to commit suicide and he was going to self-harm. The contemporaneous records from WhatsApp do not show N expressing concerns about an imminent marriage or indeed her being committed to an engagement but only of her desperation to get home. The call on 13 October (which was not recorded simultaneously) and DC Cherryman&#8217;s statement suggest she was not unhappy with the idea she had been going to get married but was now. The mother and her sisters and E all married for love. There is no history of arranged marriages. The family were on the radar of the FCO and police and knew it; the mother herself went to the police on 2</span><span class="None" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">nd</span><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> October to ask for the passport orders to be lifted. The father knew the legal age for marriage was not less than 16. He values education and I accept he had expressed views to E on marriage and education. It would show breath-taking chutzpah or disregard for authority for the mother to go to the police to remove port alerts made in relation to forced marriage fears and then to go off and arrange another daughter&#8217;s forced marriage. Although I have not been impressed with the mother&#8217;s attitude I do not believe she is either that stupid or that arrogant.  The thrust of the call on 13 October and the WhatsApp messages and Q&#8217;s account and what P and N both said and now say is that N was desperate to come home, wanted to resume education.  This is what P was saying to Q in November. Her parents were not listening to her. She wanted to be educated like her older sister who has done very well at school, a beauty course did not match her aspirations.  As time went on and they were not listened to the children took matters into their own hands. N and P engaged Q to assist &#8211; she is a strong character, is prepared to stand up to the parents and fight for her nephews and nieces and she calls out poor behaviour. As matters dragged on &#8211; and the police referral did not occur for some 3 weeks after the 13</span><span class="None" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> October and then led to no immediate action so N&#8217;s desperation increased and so P and Q and N were left on hold. The texts between P and N illustrate her becoming increasingly frantic and telling P if he wants to see her alive he needs to do something and him responding that the team is on it. None of the WhatsApp either in October or in early December refer to N being concerned about an imminent wedding ceremony. I conclude that the kernel of truth that was the loosely arranged &#8216;engagement&#8217; was transmuted by P into an imminent marriage supplemented by risks to himself and sexual abuse added in for extra impact; hence the discussion with Q on 7</span><span class="None" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> December about the Forced Marriage Unit and the call to the FCO on 7</span><span class="None" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> December. This conclusion seems to me the only one that makes sense out of all the many fragments of evidence before me. It means that the central allegation of the forced marriage application does not amount to a forced marriage or any imminent risk of that at all in November/ December 2017. In terms of Sir Nicholas Wall&#8217;s observations about the distinction between consensual arranged marriages and forced marriages involving serious human rights abuses this was far closer to the arranged marriage end of the spectrum but taking the form of a loose commitment not undertaken with N&#8217;s consent but not with the intention subsequently of her being forced to marry B whether she wanted to or not. The nature of the arrangement was such that had it endured to an age when she might legally have married I am satisfied she would have had a say and had she not wished it, it would not have proceeded. That may beg the question of if had she remained in Pakistan whether and how she would then have been able to express her true feelings but that stage has not been reached. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="border:none"><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">It seems clear from what N herself says together with what her mother father and the school say that she was enrolled in school in Pakistan in late September 2016. She had of course been expecting to return to her school in England. It is also clear that she only stayed in school for some three months. I accept that this was probably because she was struggling given that she does not speak Urdu and she had been experiencing problems in school in England. It ought to have been self-evident to the mother that N would not be likely to thrive in such circumstances. I also accept that she then did a beauty course for three months. However this must have come to an end prior to the mother returning to England on 1 May 2017. The mother and father&#8217;s account of having to wait for a certificate to sign on to a further course in November 2017 did not seem to make sense. In any event the net result was that N remained out of education until she returned to England. She did not commence a beauty course in November 2017 although she was still in Pakistan at that point.  Her education was sacrificed by the mother so that N could remain there with her. As I have said earlier it seems likely that N was the mother&#8217;s main physical support for many tasks and this may have contributed to the lack of priority given to her education. In contrast T was placed in school remained there throughout and appears to have thrived. I&#8217;m prepared to accept that N herself suppressed unhappiness in terms of schooling but this is hardly surprising. The parents&#8217; attempt to shift responsibility and to say that it was all N&#8217;s choice is a further illustration of their inability to take responsibility for their own actions.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="border:none"><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">It is immediately apparent from the body worn video of 8 December when service of the order was effected that both the mother and the father were angered by this further intervention into their family life. When served with the documents it would be immediately apparent that it was being suggested that the parents were forcing not only N to marry but also P and that it was being said they were in serious danger. It is not entirely clear what evidence was placed before Ms Justice Russell on 8 December as neither the note of the ex parte hearing [B14a] or the order itself refer to it. The making of the order clearly prompted a flurry of activity in both England and Pakistan. N describes a meeting taking place at her grandmother&#8217;s home. The mother&#8217;s immediate reaction in England was to pick up the phone to H. Given my finding that there was no threat of an imminent forced marriage, there was no suggestion at all that P was being forced into a marriage it is not surprising that in the hours and days which immediately followed the service of the order the mother father and other members of the family would have been speaking to each other and to N asking why she was saying these things. That there was a kernel of truth to them would no doubt have been overlooked in the panic. I am therefore satisfied that N&#8217;s description in her ABE interview of telephone calls in which she was urged to say there was indeed nothing untoward at all going on in Pakistan were made. It would be extraordinary indeed had they not questioned her and urged her to withdraw the allegations. Both the mother and the father&#8217;s account of having had no contact with her save supervised is not the truth. The telephone records showing the communications from N to the family home and from P to the family home showed just how regularly the children were in contact with the family. The mother says that the family landline was in E&#8217;s room and that she paid for it out of her wages. That might be so; given E&#8217;s husband was in Pakistan I think it is likely that landline or social media-based communication was the cheapest way they could keep in contact. However that does not mean that the landline phone was not available outside that room to all members of the family. I note from the body worn video of 8 December that the mother picks up and calls H on what appears to be a landline handset which was in the living room. It may well be that the landline base set was in E&#8217;s room but one way or another, whether through other handsets placed throughout the house, or otherwise I&#8217;m quite satisfied other members of the family had access to the landline. And so when multiple calls are made to the home landline on the 23</span><span class="None" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">rd</span><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> to 24</span><span class="None" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> 25</span><span class="None" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> of December 5th 9</span><span class="None" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> 10</span><span class="None" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> 13</span><span class="None" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> 20</span><span class="None" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> 21</span><span class="None" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">st</span><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> 22</span><span class="None" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">nd</span><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> of January and February lasting from seconds through to half an hour I&#8217;m quite satisfied that these were not just E and N. Likewise calls from P in February to the home landline lasting up to an hour were I am satisfied not just to E. By this time it would have been clear to the parents that not only was forced marriage an issue but also sexual abuse of N and T as well as allegations of domestic violence and abuse of the children. Precisely how pressure was exerted on the children I cannot determine. E may at times have been used as a conduit for parental pressure. It may have been that the mother in particular may also have exerted pressure. Given that the mother is a more forceful character and prepared to assert her rights to a higher degree than the father it seems probable that she more than the father took the lead on this although I&#8217;m quite satisfied that the father well knew this was being done. Again in a sense it is understandable because some of the allegations they had made plainly were untrue and so they were entitled to feel they could tell the children they ought to withdraw them.  However there were also significant elements of the complaints the children had made which the mother and father knew to be true and where the only purpose in exerting pressure was to absolve themselves of responsibility and to avoid criticism and involvement of state authorities in their family. Given the position they had put the children in, even in respect of the false allegations placing the children under pressure was unfair or unwise at best. As if the children were not under enough pressure as a result of the situation that had been created for them their parents further added to it. In respect of the true allegations that the children had made the pressure they exerted on them was unconscionable. Although the majority of this conduct took place after the commencement of the proceedings it was mirrored earlier in 2016 and between 8 December and the commencement of the care proceedings.</span></p>

In respect of the untrue allegations or the exaggerated allegations (the forced marriage) perhaps the children would have confessed in any event. In respect of the true allegations the combination of the unexpected removal into foster care and their unhappiness there, their separation from each other, the general pressure and stress of being in the eye of a storm and the displeasure and disapproval that they had incurred from other members of their family in particular their mother and father must have created an intolerable pressure for them which they felt could only be relieved by withdrawing the allegations in their entirety. N&#8217;s demeanour in her second ABE interview was telling. She was flat, often monosyllabic. It is clear from the notes of O that P did tell her of a conversation with his mother in which his father in the background said he should drop the allegations. I see no reason to disbelieve either O or P in this regard. His subsequent denial of the conversation when it was brought up in front of social workers is perhaps no surprise. That he was as O said wavering as to whether he should withdraw the allegations or not is also no surprise. Given that some of them were true it must have been very difficult for him to contemplate saying they were not. Likewise N. The evidence that they gave in court I also found to be stilted and lacking a connection with their emotions; more repeating a mantra than speaking to the truth. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none">Any one of the findings that I have made might not have fallen within the definition of significant harm or risk thereof attributable to unreasonable parenting. I think it is likely, had the forced marriage and other allegations not surfaced that the family would have remained off the local authority radar. It is unlikely that care proceedings would have been commenced based on exposure to domestic violence, emotional abuse and educational neglect. However the constellation of findings that I have made satisfy me that the threshold was crossed at the relevant time. The combination of all the matters but in particular the suppression of N&#8217;s desire to return home, the enforced separation of the siblings and the consequences for them and the parents complete disregard for the emotional impact upon them against a backdrop where the children&#8217;s earlier exposure to a toxic domestic atmosphere made them particularly reliant on each other and vulnerable have caused significant harm to these children. That the parents allowed a situation to be created where their children were so desperate that they were prepared to make such serious allegations against their parents illustrates the point of how profoundly the parents were ignoring their children&#8217;s emotional needs. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none">However, although the threshold is met that is not an end to the matter. The fact that the threshold is met does not answer the question of what is now in the children&#8217;s best interests. That has become a particularly complex issue in the unusual circumstances of this case and will need careful consideration. The children want to return home. The parents want them home. Perhaps the parents will be able to acknowledge the responsibility they carry for this situation. If they can and are thus able to remove any burden of responsibility from the children, and are indeed able to say sorry to their children there may be a way forward. Acceptance of their responsibility - or at least some move towards acceptance - will be likely to be a prerequisite for the children to return to their care. How could this court place the children back into the situation which existed prior to December 2017 without some insight from the parents into their responsibility? How could the children cope emotionally with living in a household in which they were held to blame? It seems to me it would be very difficult indeed to contemplate that. The parents, as the adults, but in particular as the parents, must create the conditions in which a return becomes a possibility. That will have to be determined at a later date. There is much that will have to occur before that decision will be capable of being taken. </p>

N says that her mother spoke to the paternal family and her mother agreed to an engagement. She said that it took place on Friday, 16 September October or November.

T&#8217;s response to the questioning from whichever angle it was attempted whether by reference to drawings, gingerbread dolls, the larder, what sex is all elicited a response from this little girl which clearly indicated to me that she really had no idea what they were talking about and that sex or dirty things were truly a mystery to her. I got no sense of unease or worry from her. Her response seemed entirely natural. By the end of the interview, it had become uncomfortable to watch given the persistence of the techniques applied. Had she eventually said something I have little doubt that the court would have viewed it with a high degree of skepticism.</span></p>
