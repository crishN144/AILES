	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This is a judgment on the preliminary issue of whether this court has jurisdiction to hear an application for a child arrangements order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> when the child and parents concerned all live abroad. The Applicant is the father and the Respondent the mother of two children: J, aged 15, and A, aged 10. The parties and their children are all British citizens. The parties married in August 2013 in Nottingham but separated three years later and divorced, the decree absolute having been made by the Family Court in Newport, Gwent, in August 2017. Currently, J lives with the father in Country B, whilst A lives with the mother in Country C. Both countries are in the Middle East and neither are signatories to the 1996 Hague Convention. The application before the court is the father&#8217;s dated 30 September 2021 for an order that A should live with him in country B. By order of HHJ Lynch on 2 November 2021, the matter was listed for a hearing of the preliminary issue of jurisdiction.</p>

The court recorded that it had jurisdiction on the basis of habitual residence. In effect, the court allowed the mother to take A with her to live in Country C where they both remain.

This is denied by the mother and I have received no evidence on the matter beyond the father&#8217;s assertion. The father and J decided to move to the Middle East, specifically to Country B where the father had an offer of a job. He says that the intention was to be closer to A. He applied to the Family Court at Sheffield for permission to remove J from the jurisdiction to live with him in Country B. By consent of the parties, HHJ Lynch made orders on 22 July 2020 permitting the father to relocate with J to Country B, and providing for J to live with the father, A to live with the mother, and for each child to spend time with the parent with whom they were not living. Although the child arrangements orders were in respect of both children, the court recorded that it had jurisdiction in relation to J on the basis of habitual residence but did not make any recording of its jurisdiction in relation to the orders concerning A.

He alerted the Country C&#8217;s police and child protection services but this resulted in no action being taken against the mother. Indeed, the mother made a complaint of harassment against the father and he signed a document which he now understands was an agreement not to make allegations against the mother, in order to allow him to leave Country C. The father&#8217;s contact with A has been very restricted, he says, and concerned for her welfare, he has made his application to this court for an order that she should live with him.</p>

In that case the mother was British, the father, French. The parties had divorced in Dubai and the father was granted custody of the child. The French courts refused to recognise the Dubai divorce. The mother petitioned for divorce in England and applied for a child arrangements order. At first instance Mostyn J recognised the Dubai divorce and set aside the mother&#8217;s petition. In any event he would have dismissed her application for a child arrangements order on the basis that the English court did not have jurisdiction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2(1)</ref>(b)(i) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1986</ref>.

They were not made redundant by the repeal of ss 41 and 42, as Mostyn J determined, but were introduced to replace the latter. This was expressly considered by the Law Commissions and, for the reasons given, it was recommended that this jurisdiction should continue. In my view, the reasons they gave, and which were clearly accepted, remain equally valid today.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;4.8<marker name="tab"/>The practical application of this general principle raises a problem as to when, for the purpose of custody jurisdiction, proceedings for divorce, nullity or judicial separation should be regarded as coming to an end. The effect of existing law in all three United Kingdom countries is that once the court is duly seised of the matrimonial dispute, it retains jurisdiction to deal with questions relating to custody of and access to the children. This jurisdiction is retained however long ago the divorce was granted, however distant the connection of the child with the country in which the divorce took place, and however close and long-standing the child&#8217;s connection with some other part of the United Kingdom. The question we have to answer is whether, for the purposes of our scheme, the jurisdiction of the divorce court to make custody orders should continue so long as the child is within the appropriate age limit, i.e. 18 in England and Wales and Northern Ireland and 16 in Scotland. </p>

Our main reason for reaching this conclusion is the impossibility of devising any general rule to the contrary effect which would not sometimes operate against the interests of the child&#8217;s welfare or against those of the parents.</p>

That said, his submissions are persuasive as to the fact that, if the mere existence of divorce proceedings here can clothe the court with jurisdiction to make child welfare orders in respect of children habitually resident elsewhere, then it would drive a coach and horses, or at least a coach, through the now generally accepted approach to the issue of jurisdiction. Clearly, if Parliament had wanted to say that, whenever there are pending matrimonial proceedings here, this court should without more have jurisdiction in respect of issues regarding the parties&#8217; children, then it could have done so. But it did not; and yet the criterion for jurisdiction remains &#8220;in or in connection with&#8221; matrimonial proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;[17] It is self-evident on the face of the petition that the application which the mother now wishes to make is not &#8220;in&#8221; her matrimonial proceedings, because no application is nor could have been made there. But what does &#8220;in connection with&#8221; actually mean? Mr Hale submits it merely means that if there are pending divorce proceedings, then any application regarding the children is automatically connected with them; but I cannot accept that. I consider, as did Judith Parker J obiter in <span style="font-style:italic">AP v TD</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 FLR 1851" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 FLR 1851</ref>, paras 122&#8211;123 that there must be some nexus more than just the mere existence of the two sets of proceedings and the fact that the parties to them are the same. It is not entirely easy to see what nexus there can or could be between proceedings seeking quite different reliefs; but it may be that the question is simply one of fact and degree. As a proposition which I put to Mr Scott and he accepted (and from which Mr Hale did not dissent), one can envisage a petition which raises the same issues as a Children Act application made at about the same time (for example &#8220;unreasonable behaviour&#8221; allegations against the respondent involving his behaviour towards the children). Such issues would be &#8220;connected&#8221; both as to content and in point of time. But that is not the case here. The mother&#8217;s application regarding the children arises out of events in June 2016 and raises issues wholly unrelated to the issues in the divorce proceeding issued nine months previously in September 2015. As Mr Scott submits, her application relating to the children could have been made if the parties had not been married or, indeed, if they were not getting divorced; it is freestanding.&#8221;</p>

In the light of the Explanatory Note to the Rules introducing the amendments consequent on Brussels II Revised, a purposive construction of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 2(1)</ref>(b)(i) would support an interpretation of the provisions bringing it into line with the provisions of Brussels II Revised, and away from the UK based "continuing proceedings" jurisdiction. The time frame of the revoked FPR 2.40 is similar to the time frame for continuing jurisdiction based on divorce in Brussels II and Article 12 of Brussels II Revised. In my judgment to fall within the residual jurisdiction there must be proximity between the divorce proceedings and the court being asked to determine a question of making an order in relation to children. </p>

It seems to me that it must be right that the phrase &#8216;in or in connection with&#8217; must mean something more than the mere existence for a child arrangements order being made whilst a divorce petition is continuing. The Court of Appeal in Lachaux refers to the application being made because the marriage is being dissolved. Thus one is looking for something which creates some nexus or connection even perhaps a tenuous connection in order for the wording of the statutory provision to be fulfilled. Ms Halsall emphasised that the Court of Appeal had supported a broad construction of the phrase not a narrow one. Ultimately it is probably a question of fact.&#8221;</p>

Paragraph 4.11 of the Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission&#8217;s report recommended that where a court has jurisdiction in relation to divorce proceedings, as here, it should continue to have jurisdiction to make custody orders in the course of those proceedings. Accordingly it might be contended that if the divorce proceedings are regarded as &#8220;continuing&#8221; (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/42/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.42(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1986</ref>), then the mere fact that there are divorce proceedings in England and Wales would be sufficient to provide jurisdiction for what we would now call child arrangements orders.

If a causal link were a requirement for jurisdiction to be established, then that might produce a narrow test, rather than allowing for a &#8220;broad view&#8221;. As Bodey J&#8217;s analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">J v U</span> shows, a causal connection may be difficult to find because divorce proceedings and a child welfare applications seek &#8220;quite different reliefs.&#8221; He gave an example of a divorce being based on unreasonable behaviour by reason of conduct towards a child. In such a case the connection is not causal but is created by an overlap in the content or subject matter in the proceedings, particularly when the proceedings are close in time. At [186] of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Lachaux</span>, Moylan LJ gave the example of parents wanting the courts of England and Wales to exercise jurisdiction &#8220;for a number of reasons&#8221; where there is a connection, stating that it would be regrettable if there was no scope to accommodate such a case. </p>

In my judgment, Moylan LJ was simply highlighting that there must be some form of connection: the term &#8220;because of&#8221; merely highlights the need for there to be a reason for the application that is connected with the matrimonial proceedings. The object of the statutory provisions, enacting the recommendations of the report of the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission, was to preserve the jurisdiction of the courts to make &#8220;custody orders&#8221; (welfare orders) in proceedings for divorce, including until the child is 18, and even if the parents or child become habitually resident outside the jurisdiction.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Since the dissolution of the marriage in the present case, there have been two further court orders regarding arrangements for the children. In each case the court recorded that it had jurisdiction on the basis of the habitual residence of the child or children. As noted, A was not habitually resident in England and Wales when the child arrangements order affecting her was made, by consent, in 2020. No point was taken in 2020 that the court did not have jurisdiction with respect of A because the application was not &#8220;in connection with&#8221; the divorce proceedings. However, it appears to me that the point was not considered in part because the parties had come to agreement as to child arrangements and the main reason for the father having made the application at that time was for permission to remove J from the jurisdiction to Country B. In the circumstances the mother should not be prevented now from contending that the court has no jurisdiction just because she did not take the point, about A, in 2020.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Those two previous court orders nevertheless highlight how much has happened within this family since the decree absolute. At the time of the divorce the parties and the children were living in Country D, but the parties were domiciled in the jurisdiction of England and Wales, which gave the Family Court in Newport jurisdiction. Subsequent to the decree absolute the parties and children returned to England, J then went to live in Scotland for a year, the mother and A moved to Country C, and then the father and J moved to Country B. These events over the past four years have followed the breakdown of the parties&#8217; relationship but they are not related to the divorce proceedings themselves. On the facts of the present case, it does not appear that the children are necessarily living abroad on a temporary basis. They might well remain living in the Middle East for the remainder of their childhoods. The father&#8217;s <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> application is very much a free-standing application made because of changes of circumstances, and because of his concerns for the welfare of his daughter. The divorce four years ago is not the context within which the application is now being made. It is not the reason or basis for the application. In 2018, the court recorded the father&#8217;s agreement that it was in A&#8217;s best interests to live with the mother in Country C. It is the alleged subsequent disclosure of abuse, long after the decree absolute, which has triggered his current application. </p>

On the other hand, evidence of the existence and operation of systems and laws of child protection in Country C would be relevant to the question of forum. So too might evidence of the involvement of the authorities in Country C. Had I determined that the court did have jurisdiction, I would have given directions for evidence to be filed and served to assist the court to determine the appropriate forum.

The Applicant father&#8217;s statement, which was the only witness evidence before the court, did not mention any financial matters, let alone his intention to issue Form A upon resolution of his <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> application. Hence the matters set out at 29 (ii) to (vii) above were entirely new submissions based on assertion or evidence which whilst available was not previously put before the court. </p>

The court had previously directed a preliminary hearing on jurisdiction and the applicant should have made his case at the hearing.

However, the mother asks the court to seek to avoid further unnecessary litigation and if the father&#8217;s new arguments are not addressed, he may be more likely to seek to make them on appeal. Hence, I shall briefly address those new arguments, none of which persuade me to reconsider my decision in this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Form A is used to give notice of intention to make an application for financial provision. On its face it states that it is for use when applications for financial provision are made &#8220;in connection with&#8221; matrimonial or civil partnership proceedings (divorce, dissolution etc).&#8221; The father has not yet used Form A and the assertion that he intends to do so is not supported by evidence from the father himself. There has been no opportunity to the mother to test the assertion and it appears to be opportunistic. Hence, even if an application for a financial order were capable of constituting &#8220;proceedings for divorce&#8221;, as the applicant now claims, no notice of intention to make such an application has been given and so no such application is &#8220;pending&#8221; or &#8220;extant&#8221;. A prayer within divorce proceedings which have been concluded with a decree absolute does not, in my judgment, mean that there is an extant or pending application for a financial order unless or until notice of an intention to apply for an order, using Form A, has been issued.</p>

I do not accept the criticism that a family court should, on its own initiative, have invited further submissions on the exercise of the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction. The circumstances do not obviously raise the question of whether that jurisdiction should be exercised. The mother has had no opportunity to submit evidence directed to that issue and it would be wrong for me to make any determination on it. There are clearly factual disputes about A&#8217;s circumstances and welfare. I have had no opportunity to hear A&#8217;s voice. However, I note the judgment of Moylan LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (A Child)</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2020/922" uk:canonical="[2020] EWCA Civ 922" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWCA Civ 922</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2020] 3 WLR 1175" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] 3 WLR 1175</ref> that the court should proceed with great caution before exercising the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction and must identify sufficiently compelling circumstances before doing so. I also note that in the present case the application is not for an order for the return of A to this jurisdiction but for an order that A lives with the father in Saudi Arabia. Whilst I do not decide the issue, it is clear that there would be very considerable obstacles in the way of any application by the father for the court to exercise its <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction. </p>
