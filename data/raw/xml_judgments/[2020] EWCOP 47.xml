She brought to the hearing on its second day the original Letters of Guardianship, bearing the raised seal of the US court.  Although originally the Applicants relied on these orders as the basis for seeking AB&#8217;s return to her mother&#8217;s care, by the end of the hearing their position seemed to be that those orders could be disregarded. Intending that M and AB were now resident in the UK as a long-term arrangement, M considered that what she wants now is an English welfare deputyship under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> effectively to replace the American Letters of Guardianship.

	      <content>
		<p style="margin-left:0.8in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:-0.01in">It was generally agreed that if MN&#8217;s habitual residence was still California at the time when the order for return was made, then the English Court&#8217;s powers were limited to those in Part 4 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>; but if MN&#8217;s habitual residence was by then in England, the Court had it&#8217;s &#8216;full, original jurisdiction&#8217; under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. There was general acceptance (paragraph 21) that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">mere passage of time if sufficiently long could effect a change of habitual residence even if the original removal were wrongful</span>&#8221; but also that on the facts (just over 12 months) no such length of time had elapsed. Hedley J concluded (paragraph 22) that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the question of authority to remove is the key in this case to the question of habitual residence&#8230; It is well recognised in English law that the removal of a child from one jurisdiction to another by one parent without the consent of the other is wrongful and is not effective to change habitual residence&#8230;It seems to me that the wrongful removal (in this case without authority under the Directive whether because Part 3 is not engaged or the decision was not made in good faith) of an incapacitated adult should have the same consequence and should leave the courts of the country from which she was taken free to take protective measures. Thus in this case were the removal &#8216;wrongful&#8217;, I would hold that MN was habitually resident in California at the date of Judge Cain&#8217;s orders.</span>&#8221;  </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.8in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:-0.01in">On the other hand (paragraph 23), if MN&#8217;s removal from California was a proper and lawful exercise of authority under the Directive, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">it seems to me most probable that MN will have become habitually resident in England and Wales and this court will be required to accept and exercise a full welfare jurisdiction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> pursuant to paragraph 7(1)(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.&#8221;</span> If MN was already habitually resident in England and Wales by the time the American court made the order for her return, then (paragraph 25)) &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">that will be the end of recognition and enforcement proceedings because the qualifying condition of paragraph 19(1) will not be made out.&#8221;</span></p>

The alternative ways of resolving the question were either by determination by the US court within the American proceedings, or &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the parties must agree on a single joint expert competent to advise the court on this point</span>.&#8221;  </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">Whilst the question of the validity of PLP&#8217;s actions under the Directive remained undetermined, Hedley J went on (at paragraph 26) to consider the mandatory nature of Schedule 3 paragraph 19(1) and the grounds for its disapplication. Particularly in regard to the &#8216;public policy&#8217; ground, he observed that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">A decision of an experienced court with a sophisticated family and capacity system would be most unlikely ever to give rise to a consideration of 4(a): the use of the word &#8216;manifestly&#8217; suggests circumstances in which recognition of an order would be repellent to the judicial conscience of the court.</span>&#8221; </p>

	      <content>
		<p style="margin-left:0.8in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:-0.01in">In turn this question raised the issue of the extent to which the Court takes into account the best interests of the protected person in an application for recognition. Hedley J concluded (at paragraph 31) that &#8220;&#8230; <span style="font-style:italic">a decision to recognise under para 19(1) or to enforce under para 22(2) is not a decision governed by the best interests of MN </span>&#8230;.&#8221; and he gave three reasons for this: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;First, I do not think that a decision to recognise or enforce can be properly described as a decision &#8216;for and on behalf of MN&#8217;. She is clearly affected by the decision but it is a decision in respect of an order and not a person. Secondly, this rather technical reason is justified as reflecting the policy of the Schedule and of Part 4 namely ensuring that persons who lack capacity have their best interests and their affairs dealt with in the country of habitual residence; to decide otherwise would be to defeat that purpose. Thirdly, best interests in the implementation of an order clearly are relevant and are dealt with by para 12 which would otherwise not really be necessary.</span>&#8221;  </p>

As the Ministry of Justice has observed, inevitably there may be concerns about some of the foreign jurisdictions from which orders might come. But as the Ministry also observes, taking account of such concerns is surely the purpose of the public policy review. Although no wideranging review as to the merits of the foreign measure is either necessary or appropriate, a limited review will always be required as indicated by the European court in Pellegrini. That will be sufficient to identify any cases where the content and the form of the foreign measure, and the process by which it was taken, are objectionable. It also seems to me that the circumstances in which Sch 3 is likely to be invoked, and the number of countries whose orders are presented for recognition, are likely to be limited. In oral submissions, Mr Rees pointed out that, in theory, the court could be faced with applications to recognise and enforce orders from any country in the world, including, for example, North Korea or Iran. That may be right in theory, but common sense suggests it is, to say the least, unlikely in practice, at least in the foreseeable future. And if such orders were to be presented for recognition, the public policy review would surely lead swiftly to identifying grounds on which recognition would be refused. It is much more likely that the orders presented for recognition will be those of foreign countries whose legal systems, laws and procedures are closely aligned to our own. Concerns of this nature can be addressed by admitting evidence of the process by which the foreign protective measures were made and general evidence relating to the legal system of the state that made the order.</span>&#8221;  </p>

Particularly fortified by paragraph 17 of PD 23A, I am satisfied that it is not necessary to import the inevitable delay which transfer to a Tier 3 judge at this point would bring, and I may deal with these proceedings today.    </p>

In effect, the determination of issues put before Monroe Surrogate Court has been thwarted by actions of M taken in bad faith. Recognition of the guardianship authority in the face of frustrated proceedings to discharge it would endorse the bad faith of M. It is not the measure (ie the Letters of Guardianship) which is manifestly contrary to public policy but rather the <span style="font-style:italic">recognition</span> of it in circumstances where the US court was actively engaged in the process of considering whether the measure should be discharged immediately before AB&#8217;s was removal from its jurisdiction. </p>

If the purpose behind either adjournment or interim decision was to revisit the question of recognition in the light of the US court&#8217;s determination of the discharge petition, a better approach would be to require a new application for recognition if the discharge petition failed. Such application would then be free of any question of &#8216;bad faith&#8217;.     </p>

Recognition has as its object the measure as it exists in the Contracting State where it has been taken&#8230; Recognition by operation of law means that it will not be necessary to resort to any proceedings in order to obtain such recognition, so long as the person who is relying on the measure does not take any step towards enforcement.

Such conclusion is <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> a reflection on the merits of the Letters of Guardianship themselves, or the powers of the US court to grant such Letters.

Following the principle of recognition by operation of law, as explained at paragraph 116 of the Lagarde Report, M was in an equivalent position to an English deputy with authority to determine residence, at least until she took a step towards enforcement. A narrow interpretation of paragraph 20 may therefore be vulnerable to criticism of inconsistency with the mandatory nature of the recognition provisions, and a wider interpretation &#8211; which considers whether M falls within the definition of persons who may make a valid decision for the purposes of the &#8216;no refusals&#8217; requirement- ought to be considered. </p>
