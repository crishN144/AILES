In the mother's case her family is well-to-do.  She has two siblings in Iran as well as her parents, and one of the siblings has a young child who is, of course, a cousin to the children with whom I am concerned.   The mother's links with England go back to her birth, because her parents were resident here at that time, and she lived here until she was three years' old.   About 20 years later, she came back to England via a brief stay in Germany, and has remained here.  </span></p>

As a result of that order children have spent very significant amounts of time with both parents, and it is plain that their relationships with each parent are strong and very important to them.  </span></p>

It is apparent that the girl particularly, but also the boy, are anxious not to let either parent down when expressing preferences, and I hope that whatever else happens after these proceedings are over the parents will reflect on ways in which they can, as much as possible, relieve their children of that anxiety.  I will direct, as the parents agree, that they should attend a Separated Parents' Information Programme again, to give them some more thinking time about this. But, at all events, these are plainly very able and committed parents, who rightly feel proud of their children.  </span></p>

Broadly, as to that, father does not oppose such travel to Hague Convention countries, but does not agree to an extension to Iran or other non-Hague Convention countries, and he suggests certain safeguards that should be put in place. </span></p>

On that occasion, I am told, the court specifically considered whether expert legal advice should be obtained about the situation in Iran, but the conclusion was reached that it would not be necessary, because the overall situation could be adequately understood in the absence of such advice.  I follow that thinking and, indeed, for almost all purposes it has proved effective at this hearing.  I do not discount the possibility that some more detailed assistance might have been gained from an expert in Iranian law but, in my judgment, the court has sufficient information before it to reach conclusions about the international issue here.  </span></p>

This is the father's allegation that during the course of the marriage, though not since, the mother would make statements that if the marriage broke down she would take the children to Iran and he would not see them.  The mother denies ever having made any such a statement, or even a suggestion of it.    It is not easy, from written evidence drafted by lawyers and brief oral evidence, to be sure where the truth lies in this respect, but for what it is worth my conclusion is that the father is probably right to say that the mother has on one, or more than one, occasion made a remark of that kind.  I think it likely that such a remark was made in the heat of an argument and it may well be that the mother is not willing to accept that now because she is concerned that any acceptance would damage her case.  I will consider the significance to be attached to this at a later stage.</span></p>

The law in this respect is familiar.  The children's welfare is paramount, but the court gains significant assistance from decisions of the Court of Appeal in particular in this field.   There are two that I particularly refer to.  The first is the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">A</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1115" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1115" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA (Civ) 1115</ref>.  This decision points to the obligation on the court to carefully assess the magnitude of a risk of retention abroad in a non-Hague Convention country, and the magnitude of the consequences of such an unlawful retention.  Where there is a risk it emphasises the importance of the investigating safeguards that would be capable of having a real and tangible effect in the other jurisdiction, and suggests that, in most cases, expert evidence will be needed.  </span></p>

The CAFCASS officer supports effectively a removal of the prohibited steps order in her report.  However, in her oral evidence she accepted that she had not encountered a case of this kind before, and I think she will forgive me for saying that, in the end, she was not able to provide as much assistance on this issue as she was on the domestic issue.  The parties have set out competing positions in somewhat more detail, in particular with regard to safeguards for overseas travel, although they do not agree what that travel should include.  I will not labour this judgment by reciting their positions which appear very largely in their written documents.  </span></p>

This is not disputed.  It would involve taking children born in England, completely assimilated into London life, dedicated to their education at the school which they attend, children for whom their relationship with their father is precious, and requiring them, against their wishes, to leave all that behind and live under very different conditions.  So, there is no difficulty in seeing just how harmful wrongful removal would be. </span></p>

In that regard, it is worthy of note that the mother's family is comfortably off and established in Teheran.  It is not, I think, necessary to reach any conclusion on the father's more extensive anxieties about behind-the-scenes influence, necessary or possible.  It is further common ground between the parties that the father would be at a severe disadvantage in seeking remedies in Iran because of his sexual orientation and his known campaigning stance in the human rights field.  It is common ground that if the father was himself to go to Iran he would be at personal risk because of the attitude of the regime in Iran to homosexuality and matters of that kind.  So, there could be no confidence that a retention could reliably be undone.  </span></p>

I have already mentioned a number of them &#8211; Mr P, and A, and the schools.  I further attach significance to the level of contact that the mother has supported with the father ever since the separation that must have been a particularly difficult one.  The levels of contact that have taken place have been child-centred.  I am more than aware of conflicts between parents, the behaviour on the part of Mr P that led to a caution, angry, abusive voicemail on one or more occasions from the father to the mother, but these are, in my view, peripheral when compared to the commitment of both parents to the children's relationships with each other.  These incidents are unfortunate, they should not happen, and for the children, particularly as they get older it must be incredibly embarrassing to see your parents behaving in this way.   But the core of this is the dependable level of contact that there has been.  </span></p>

They have a point of view in this, and their very clear point of view is that they want to continue living in England, leading a life that they know and enjoy.  If it was suggested to them that they should go and live in Iran full-time they would be appalled, however fond they are of their grandparents, cousins, uncle and aunt.   These being the parents that, they are I find that they both, and in particular the mother, would give very considerable weight to the children's perspective.</span></p>

The significance of Mr P, which is why the father puts him forward, is that a family holiday with him would be an outward sign that the mother's current life in London was continuing, whereas a trip without Mr P might arise in circumstances where difficulties had arisen in that marriage.  The significance of travel in A's absence is obvious.  I discount the possibility that the mother would take two children to Iran and leave one behind on anything other than a very short term basis.  There is, on the mother's side, the availability of sufficient funds to finance a bond to give the father a fighting fund if things went wrong.  There is the possibility of a document being created that would strengthen the father's legal position in Iran by granting him and his family custody of the children while they were there, and there is the possibility which would arise whatever my decision of the mother giving a solemn undertaking on her holy book that she would return the children at the end of any holiday. </span></p>

I do not believe that, even if circumstances changed, she would inflict such harm on the children by keeping them in Iran, in particular, when they have such a strong relationship with their father.  If the mother, for whatever reason, was to reverse her long-term support for that relationship I doubt that the children would ever forgive her.  I do not, while understanding the father's position and wish to compromise to some significant extent, see any logic in trusting the mother to take the children to a Hague Convention country when it would be so easy for her to use that to travel onwards to Iran if she was determined to do so.  </span></p>

I do not think that the father, strongly though he feels about this, lacks the ability to manage his concerns and anxieties.  I consider that the degree of integration that the mother has in her family life is genuine and deep, and that the safeguards bring some added protection.  I make it clear that if I did not repose that degree of trust in the mother, I would not consider that safeguards would be of any value at all.
