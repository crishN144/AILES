	    <p style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The background is that on 14 June, i.e. a week ago, the husband dispensed with the services of his legal representatives, because of a disagreement, as I understand it, as to the level of a bill they had submitted.  So he became, with effect from 14 June, a litigant in person.  His previous solicitors have declined to release to him the papers relating to these proceedings.  On Monday, the husband asked the wife&#8217;s solicitors to send him the bundles.  They offered instead to provide him with copies of the bundles if he collected them from their offices.  He was unable to do that, and so has had a very limited period of time in which to familiarise himself with the papers. Notwithstanding these difficulties, a very detailed skeleton argument has been prepared by or on behalf of the husband, and Mr Stroilov has been able to make very detailed submissions.  I am, therefore, satisfied that I have been able to undertake a fair hearing today to address the issues which have been raised before me.</span></p>

I consider that such a judgment is sufficient and appropriate, in part because this case was before King J on 7 June 2013 and she gave a short judgment in respect of the applications which were then before her.  The applications before her were, again, applications on behalf of the wife for maintenance pending suit and for a Legal Services Order, and also an application made on behalf of the husband for a variation of a freezing order.  </span></p>

The parties married on 8 January 2008. They are both Russian nationals.  They started living together, according to the wife in 2005 and, according to the husband in 2007.  They left Russia in 2009, following which the husband made a successful application for asylum as a political refugee.  The wife was also granted permission to remain in the United Kingdom.  The parties separated in August 2012.  There are no children.  This is, therefore, as described by King J, a short, childless marriage.  The husband is aged 52 and the wife is aged 28.  </span></p>

They comprise (very broadly expressed) properties in Montenegro in the joint names of the parties valued at just over &#163;500,000, properties and other assets in the wife&#8217;s name valued at approximately &#163;128,000 and properties and liquid resources (bank accounts and bonds) in the husband&#8217;s name valued at approximately &#163;2.5 million. </span></p>

It was the husband&#8217;s case that the bulk, if not all, of the assets in his name were in fact held by him on behalf of his son as the sole beneficiary.  The court had listed a 3 day hearing for the determination of that issue.  During the course of her judgment, notwithstanding the husband&#8217;s asserted case, King J decided that the husband had the financial resources available to him to satisfy a Legal Services Order.  She also decided that the wife had no assets available to her for the purposes of enabling her to obtain legal advice and representation.  In reaching those conclusions, King J was applying the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 22</ref>ZA and 22ZB of the Matrimonial Causes Act.

The reason I refer to the offer is that it makes evident the husband&#8217;s position that the wife should receive some financial provision in respect of her claim.  That is relevant, in my view, when I consider the applications for maintenance and a Legal Services Order, and more generally.</span></p>

As for the resources in her name, they consist of a flat in St Petersburg, which although it is now in the name, I believe, of her parents, the wife asserts that it is not a resource which is available to her to meet her immediate needs because it is occupied by her parents and she cannot sell it, and she is currently unable to pay for any loan which might otherwise be secured against it.  The other property she owns is in Montenegro, and it is also asserted that this is not currently available to her as a resource.  The wife has set out her interim needs as being &#163;3,300-odd a month, of which approximately &#163;2,000 per month is the rent in respect of her property.</span></p>

He contends that her budget is inflated, and he contends that she has access to resources.

In other words, the court at the final hearing would decide, having heard all the facts of the case, and having regard to the overall level of award which it was fair to make in the wife&#8217;s favour, whether or not the sums which have been paid pursuant to my order should be in addition to any such award or part of any such award.

In her submissions, Ms Gray sets out the asserted justification for a Legal Services Order in the sum of &#163;52,000.  That sum is achieved by adding up the following: two bills provided to the wife by her current solicitors, Sears Tooth, totalling approximately &#163;53,000; a bill, in respect of which I am told judgment has been obtained by her former solicitors Anthony Gold, of just over &#163;21,000; her current solicitors&#8217; costs from today up to the conclusion of the financial dispute resolution hearing of &#163;8,400; counsel&#8217;s fees for that hearing of &#163;6,000; and prospective valuers&#8217; fees of &#163;3,600. The total is approximately &#163;92,400, but there is then deducted the amount ordered to be paid by King J of &#163;40,000, leaving a balance of &#163;52,000.</span></p>

The balance of the wife&#8217;s claim for a Legal Services Order, including extensive backdating, was (referring again to the word used by King J) dismissed.  As I see it, King J listed the wife&#8217;s application for a Legal Services Order to be heard at the conclusion of the hearing which was to commence on 19 June, on the basis that, by that date, the sum of &#163;40,000 would have been exhausted by the costs of the preliminary hearing.  </span></p>

What I should decide, in my judgment, is whether, following receipt by the wife of &#163;40,200, pursuant to the order of King J, the wife will be able to fund legal services up to the conclusion of the financial dispute resolution hearing, because I do not consider it would be appropriate currently to provide a Legal Services Order that extended beyond that date, and indeed no such order is sought by Ms Gray on behalf of the wife.</span></p>

In addition, the wife has very modest liquid resources and will, pursuant to my order, be receiving &#163;3,000 per month by way of maintenance pending suit.

The first is that I have been told that NatWest are refusing to release the &#163;40,200 to the wife&#8217;s solicitors without an authority being signed permitting them to do so by the husband.  Mr Stroilov says the husband has not refused to sign that authority; he simply wishes to have time to consider it.  I am going to give him until 12 o&#8217;clock on Monday to consider it.  I will order the husband to sign such authority as may be required by NatWest, to be in the form provided to him today by the wife&#8217;s solicitors, by 12 o&#8217;clock on Monday.  I am also going to provide that, in default of the husband signing such authority by 12 o&#8217;clock on Monday, the same do be signed on his behalf by a district judge of the Principal Registry.  That will ensure that the wife receives the sum of &#163;40,200, as provided for in the order of King J.  </span></p>

Although those orders might principally have been directed towards the preliminary hearing which was then listed, I do not propose to reconsider the orders that she made, because in my view the information which she ordered to be provided is equally necessary for the purposes of the substantive financial remedy application.  During the course of his submissions, Mr Stroilov indicated that there might be difficulty in obtaining the bank accounts relating to Freshtel Holdings Limited, because it is in liquidation.  I do not at the moment consider it appropriate to vary the order, because the fact that a company has gone into liquidation does not in my mind justify amending the order made by King J.</span></p>

I have no idea of the likely cost of procuring all those valuations, nor whether it would be possible for them to be obtained for the purposes of the FDR on 15 July.  Further, I question whether it is necessary to have those valuations for the purposes of the financial dispute resolution, given the fact that the assets already have a cumulative value of just over &#163;3 million.  Given the time available, and given the fact that I have no indication of what the likely cost would be, and given my view that the FDR can be effective without such valuations being obtained, I do not propose to make any directions in respect of valuations. </span></p>
