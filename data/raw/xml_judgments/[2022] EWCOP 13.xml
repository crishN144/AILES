The proposals are contained in a treatment plan set out in the court bundle and include the withdrawal of oxygen therapy and hydration, and the provision of palliative care including morphine and midazolam to eliminate (as far as possible) any pain, discomfort or distress. </span></p>

Until the morning of the hearing the Official Solicitor was maintaining a stance that there might be an option for M to have some limited treatment in accordance with the wishes of the family, because although M was clearly dying there was a wider benefit to him of this because it would better enable his family to come to terms with his death. </span></p>

The current unit would be required to discharge him to another hospital, most likely the one where he was initially treated, Charing Cross.  The clinicians there had indicated they were in agreement with the plan being put forward and therefore unlikely to propose anything different.  There is no other option available for hospices and nursing homes are not able to manage patients having this type of treatment and it is extremely unlikely another hospital would take a different view. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Miss Gollop QC on behalf of the OS therefore invited the court to consider whether there was any useful purpose in holding the hearing. Given that the case was listed for one day only, that the start of the case had been delayed for a variety of reasons and could only be delayed more by hearing submissions on this point I decided to hear the evidence in any event. M&#8217;s family had all come to court and would, I think, have found it very difficult if they had not been heard. </span></p>

For reasons that are not clear from the evidence before me, he refused. Over the ensuing months he lost a very great deal of weight so that when admitted to hospital he was emaciated and weighed only 39 kg. His girlfriend, T suggested  he believed that his blood results were affected by his recent diet and that he tried to manage things by going on a fruit diet only, and then fully plant based.  He was anxious about catching Covid. When his weight continued to drop he resumed a normal diet but still he lost weight.  He still did not seek medical attention even when he became ill with what appeared to be a chest infection in the last few days he was at home. </span></p>

The ambulance crew arrived and continued with CPR for an extended period of 45 minutes and 20 cycles when spontaneous cardiac output was restored.  On admission to hospital, M was found to be emaciated with pressure sores. A safeguarding referral was made.  M was placed into an induced coma, intubated and ventilated. He also required inotropic support.  He remained in an induced coma for 12 days, but when sedation was withdrawn he still remained in a state of disordered consciousness. </span></p>

It became apparent by the morning of the hearing that there are no real options for M to be actively treated anywhere.  Charing Cross hospital (which is the hospital to which M was originally admitted) is the obvious option, but it is very likely the treating team there would determine that active treatment should cease as well. Indeed, the two consultants who treated him there have indicated that they would support the applicant&#8217;s plan.  There is no other hospital or unit which has indicated it would be able or willing to give M active treatment.  Hospices and nursing homes will not accept patients with tracheostomies and who need oxygen therapy and suctioning.  </span></p>

He was doubly incontinent and paralysed in all four limbs, with established contractures.  His heart rate was very high. The tracheostomy was in situ with the cuff inflated all the time.  Neurologically he was said to be in a prolonged disorder of consciousness.  On the PDOC pain score he scored 3-4/17 at rest but showed evidence of significant discomfort on movement and suction, raising a concern that he could perceive pain and discomfort despite his level of consciousness. </span></p>

His condition remained unstable and there were several interventions by the medical emergency team (MET) which included chest physiotherapy which was of short term benefit only and distressing.  A CT scan of his lungs showed severe damage, which was said to be due to chronic aspiration and a decision was made not to continue this intervention due to his overall deteriorating condition. </span></p>

Therefore naso-gastric feeding was discontinued, and following consultation with the Consultant in charge of the nutrition team, it was concluded that no other sort of feeding (including total parenteral nutrition &#8216;TPN&#8217;) would be futile and indeed might cause serious complications.

If he was to be moved from the unit it is more likely than not that he would die in the ambulance because movement of this sort causes him to have mucus plugs which reduce his already very limited lung function. When turning him he will often suffer from oxygen desaturation.  Further, the palliative care on offer at the RU may be better tailored to M&#8217;s needs than at Charing Cross, because they are able to provide IV rather than sub-cutaneous morphine and Midazolam (sub cutaneous being the usual route in acute hospitals). Also, M would there be likely to be on a busy and acute ward with less attention from nurses and other medical professionals.  </span></p>

TPN might extend his life expectancy but it is not safe or realistic given his many other problems.

Whilst M is almost certainly completely unaware of his surroundings, it is usual practice to allow for the small chance that experiential distress is possible and to treat him as such.

If he is given palliative care only he is likely to die within hours or days.  There is nothing that can be done about it. I appreciate that T and M&#8217;s parents struggle to accept the evidence that he will die very soon whatever my decision, but, whilst their views are sincerely held and entirely understandable, they are not based on a rational assessment of what they are being told or what is observable. They believe that M has a chance of life and that this should be given to him.  This is understandable but the medical evidence is completely to the contrary. So strong are the family&#8217;s convictions that at some point in their written statements they have suggested that the clinical team are lying and that they have malign motives. They believe that the instructed experts did not spend sufficient time with M to be able to come to their conclusions. </span></p>

Initiation of TPN would put him at risk of infection and thrombosis, and enteral nutrition will actively shorten his life because it will increase aspiration of stomach contents.  Hydration will lengthen his life a little, but the medical evidence is that this will not make him more comfortable at all.  If he has any awareness, suctioning him is intrusive and uncomfortable.

Whilst there seems to be very little or no support in the medical evidence for this view, it is true that the administration of these drugs may derive no benefit to someone who is unconscious.  Professor Wade explains in his report why he believes that someone in this state is not able to experience pain or discomfort.  Dr. Hanrahan, however, states that it is usual to give such drugs to allow for the small chance that M is able to experience some pain or discomfort and notes (as do other doctors) that there is some evidence that M does so.  Palliative care will, as much as is ever possible, guarantee the absence of pain, emotional distress and discomfort in the last days and hours of M&#8217;s  life.  It is true that it will reduce or eliminate such awareness as he has of his loved ones around him which is very difficult, but if he does have such awareness that brings with it the likelihood of distress and discomfort. This would mean suffering in a way which he cannot communicate or avoid and would be very negative. In my judgment the benefits of this treatment strongly outweigh the burdens. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt;color:#000000">The options for M are really very limited.  It would be possible for him to be transferred to Charing Cross, at least to remove him from the current environment where the relationship between the treating team and family is so very difficult and challenging.  However, I must bear in mind the following matters. First M is likely to die in transit. If he does not, then the likelihood is that the treating team there will take exactly the same view as the current team.  The relationship between that team and the family might well break down for the same reasons.  In any event, at Charing Cross M would likely be treated on an acute ward with fewer staff who will change and rotate over time. IV transmission of morphine and midazolam, which works so well may not be available.  So the possibility of a better situation for him or the family if he is to die there seems very remote. </span></p>

It is far and away in M&#8217;s best interests to remain where he is and to be treated in accordance with the plan.  I note that Professor Turner-Stokes said she would do all that was in her power to ensure the family could all be with him when he dies.  I note too that the family are able to get on with the nursing staff for much of the time they have been visiting.  Of the options available, this is the one which is in his best interests. </span></p>
