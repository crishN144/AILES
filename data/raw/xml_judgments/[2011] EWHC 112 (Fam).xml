He asked MF to let him know by 21 March 2011 if any application for permission to appeal had been made and to supply him by that date with a copy of the order I had made on the basis of my judgment. (As I have already explained, there is in fact no order.) In another email later the same day, 25 January 2011, MF asked that &#8220;In the light of new evidence and the letter of the Adjudicator&#8221; I &#8220;consider [his] appeal.&#8221; In a further email sent on 27 January 2011, he wrote:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Contrary to MF&#8217;s contention, there is no new evidence. The fact that the Official Solicitor is seeking an order for costs arising out of my judgment is not new evidence throwing any doubt on the correctness of my findings. The fact, as appears from his letter of 24 January 2011, that the Adjudicator is minded to found his determination in part upon one of my findings is not new evidence nor of itself any ground for giving permission to appeal. And the two letters of 16 December 2010 and 29 December 2010 setting out MF&#8217;s case contain no new evidence. They contain much material which is, no doubt, relevant to MF&#8217;s applications (yet to be heard) for costs and &#8216;compensation&#8217; &#8211; I express no views on the point; that is for another day &#8211; but they do not, in my judgment, disclose any remotely arguable basis upon which MF could realistically hope to persuade the Court of Appeal to interfere. Insofar as they mount any challenge to my findings they are no more than an attempt to re-argue the case and to persuade me (or the Court of Appeal) to come to a different conclusion. They identify no basis &#8211; let alone demonstrate any properly arguable basis &#8211; upon which the Court of Appeal could interfere.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should add that the application for permission to appeal is very significantly out of time. It will be noted that MF&#8217;s initial wish was to obtain a re-trial and that the first mention of any wish to appeal followed the reference to that possibility in the Adjudicator&#8217;s letter. Be that as it may, I refuse permission not because the application is out of time but because it is devoid of merit.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For essentially the same reasons I also refuse MF&#8217;s application for a re-trial. He has identified no irregularity in the proceedings and, as I have said, has produced no new evidence. In these circumstances there is simply no basis for a re-trial. A wish to have the opportunity of re-arguing a case in the hope that it will produce a different outcome does not begin to justify a request for a re-hearing.</p>
