	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Over the course of ten days in July this year (2018), I dealt with the final hearing of cross-applications made by various members of an extended Egyptian family whose interests in these proceedings arise as a result of marriage and consanguineal kinship.   The first application in time is that of NN (&#8220;the wife&#8221;) who, on 17 March 2017, was given permission by Russell J to apply to the English court for financial relief following an overseas (Egyptian) divorce.  Her substantive application under Part III of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>&#8221;) was issued on 22 March 2017.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the context of that Part III claim the wife asserts that her former husband, AS, is the legal and beneficial owner of three properties in central London and a yacht which is currently moored in Egypt.  He accepts that he has a one-third interest in two of the London properties which he claims he owns in equal one-third shares with his two sisters, the third and fourth respondents.  He denies having any beneficial interest in the third London property (mortgage free and worth some &#163;5.7 million) and/or the yacht.  Whilst he accepts that his name appears on the documents of title to both, he asserts within these proceedings that he holds the entire beneficial interest in each for his father, the second respondent.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The material before the court which has been generated over the course of sixteen months of litigation is voluminous and, condensed to its final form, runs to eight bundles of documents.  As the proceedings have developed, the wife has extended the reach of her allegations into the territory of sham, forgery and metadata manipulation.  In support of their collective denial of her case, the respondents have adduced evidence from their Egyptian lawyers and other professionals involved in the various property transactions.  There have been extensive forays into forensic tracing exercises. Vast quantities of information have been produced from Egypt and elsewhere, much of which has had to be translated from its original Arabic content.  Over the course of the trial I have heard evidence from all five parties and (by video link) from the Egyptian lawyers who were involved in one way or another in the various property transactions.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is also expert evidence in the form of two reports from expert witnesses.  The first (which was not the subject of challenge) was from Mr Dennis Willetts, an expert in digital forensics.  His report, produced in June 2018, dealt with the interpretation and meaning of certain pieces of metadata which were referenced in some of the pleadings.  The second was a report from Mr Anthony Stockton.  He was the wife&#8217;s witness whose evidence was directed towards her allegation that the husband, or someone acting on his behalf, had forged the signatures of the second third and fourth respondents on some documents evidencing their beneficial entitlement to interests in the disputed property.  He attended court and was cross-examined on the contents of his report.</p>

By her opening salvo in March 2017, she represented to the court that he had global assets worth &#8220;in excess of &#163;100 million&#8221;.  Those assets, she contended, were held in a number of jurisdictions around the world including Egypt, Dubai, the Cayman Islands, Belgium, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.  This was the basis of the evidence on which she relied to secure an early freezing order in relation to the London properties.  The husband was given less than 24 hours&#8217; notice of that application and did not seek to resist the freezing injunction whilst reserving his right to contest her claims as to beneficial ownership of the properties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In April 2018 the wife made an open offer to compromise her claims in this litigation.  That offer forms the basis of her presentation to the court as it was opened by Mr Warshaw QC on the first day of the hearing.  In short, she seeks the transfer of the London apartment (worth &#163;1.55 million gross) in which she currently lives with the parties&#8217; 9 year old son, A, on the basis that the mortgage will be redeemed from the sale proceeds of the most valuable of the two remaining properties (said by the respondents to be owned by the husband&#8217;s father).  From those proceeds, she seeks an additional lump sum of &#163;2.25 million.  All other assets would remain in the ownership of the party who currently holds them, and the husband will pay child support at the rate of &#163;30,000 per annum together with educational costs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That offer of &#163;3.8 million, which is put forward on the basis of a financial clean break with no order as to costs, has to be seen in the light of the fact that these parties were divorced in Egypt in December 2015 at a time when the wife had a degree of independent financial wealth emanating from her own family.  At the time of the divorce in Cairo, the wife was represented by an Egyptian lawyer, Mr S, who held a power of attorney which enabled him to enter into negotiations on her behalf to secure financial terms.  Mr S was a long-standing friend of her family and had acted for them, and her own father in particular, in relation to a number of transactions over the years.  The wife accepts that Mr S held a power of attorney and had instructions to act on her behalf in the divorce negotiations but claims she was in a state of significant distress at the time and did not appreciate or fully understand the terms of the deal to which he committed her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Under the terms of the Egyptian Divorce agreement, the husband had agreed to pay the wife an additional lump sum of EGP 5 million (then worth about &#163;215,000<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> The husband contends the lump sum was equivalent to c. &#163;400,000 on then prevailing <span style="font-style:italic">fx</span> rates but this figure does not appear to be correct.</p>
	      </authorialNote>) and to maintain the financial status quo ante.  This involved her remaining in one of the London properties in which she had lived with their son since 2012 when she moved to London.  Whilst she remained responsible for A&#8217;s primary care, the husband agreed to continue paying the mortgage on the property from his own resources and to maintain the monthly payments he had been making at the rate of &#163;5,000 per month to cover her expenses.  That agreement has been implemented in terms of the receipt by the wife of the lump sum payment (funded, on the husband&#8217;s case, by an advance of funds from his own father).  She continues to live rent free in the apartment which has been her home since 2012 and the periodical payments of &#163;5,000 per month have been maintained.  It is clear to me that these payments have been supplemented since the Egyptian agreement by her continuing ability to draw significant sums as a joint signatory on the husband&#8217;s credit cards.  That facility appears to have been terminated in December 2016 against the background of the husband&#8217;s allegations that she was abusing her position by significantly overspending on his accounts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is an issue between the husband and wife as to who instigated the Egyptian divorce.  That dispute has to be seen against the particular dynamics of this marriage as it evolved following the wife&#8217;s expressed wish to live in London so as to secure naturalization and, ultimately, British citizenship. Whilst the husband had both Egyptian and British nationality, he remained resident for most of their married life in their former matrimonial home in Cairo.  These are matters which I shall need to address at a later stage of this judgment but it is accepted by the parties that, following their divorce and the implementation of the Egyptian Divorce agreement, the husband continued to make financial provision on a voluntary basis over and above that agreed including some gifts of jewellery to the wife.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the Egyptian divorce, the wife waited some fifteen months before launching her Part III proceedings in London.  I have struggled to identify precisely what was, or might have been, the precipitating event for her decision to litigate in this jurisdiction.  It is clear that tensions between husband and wife had continued, not least in relation to his allegations of her overspending on the credit cards and her cross-allegations of his unwillingness to meet additional expenditure which she says she incurred in relation to their son. There have been parallel proceedings ongoing in the Family Division in relation to A and his contact with his father.  The wife alleges that he took steps in December 2016 whilst she and A were spending the holidays with her family in Cairo to prevent her from returning with their son to London.  That issue was resolved in January 2017 when the husband signed the necessary papers allowing A to return with his mother to London.  However, the tensions between them as parents continue with the wife alleging that she is now unable to risk returning to Egypt with A in case he is once again prevented from leaving that country.  She suspects that the husband&#8217;s objective is ultimately to secure a state of affairs whereby A is raised in Egypt.  She sees his actions as a fetter on her ability to travel freely between the two countries and these issues, together with the financial issues which arose in relation to payments for A, appear to have provided the catalyst for her decision to draw the line and achieve a final clean break between them in financial terms.  As she states in her written evidence,</p>

But a matter of weeks before the Egyptian agreement was concluded, she had been advised by Mishcon de Reya, a well-known leading firm of specialist London divorce lawyers. She states that the purpose of the consultation which she attended in December 2015 was to gain clarity about her rights in England.  She consulted that firm a matter of days before a scheduled trip to Cairo where the Egyptian Divorce agreement was concluded. Before leaving London she had instructed Mishcon de Reya to issue an English divorce petition which they duly did a matter of days after her initial consultation.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When the current Part III proceedings began in March 2017, the wife had approximately US$1.2 million in her bank accounts in Switzerland.  These were funds transferred to her by her own father during the marriage.  He had made his money from the oil business (and, in particular, from selling his interest in an oil rig).  She told me that these were funds which had been made available to her &#8220;to secure a decent life&#8221; in circumstances where she received no financial support following a divorce from her first husband.  Following her remarriage in 2007, she appears to have been supported financially by the husband and/or his family.  When she moved to London in 2012, she confirmed that she did not use this capital to meet her day to day expenses in London; these were being met by the husband.  Rather she regarded the funds as available for the ongoing costs of her two adult sons from her first marriage.  In addition, she had (and still has) a 50% beneficial interest in a London flat which is worth about &#163;1 million and which is mortgage free.   That property had been purchased jointly with her brother as an investment using money given to her by her father.   She did not dispute that her invested Swiss funds had throughout the last year generated an income for her of &#163;125,000 per annum.</p>

In the event of his death during that term, he undertakes to make testamentary provision so as to ensure that A inherits his beneficial interest in the property.  He offers to maintain the mortgage payments on the flat on a secured basis.  The quid pro quo for his ability to make this offer with his family&#8217;s consent is his willingness to compensate his sisters for their interest in two-thirds of the market rent which would otherwise be generated were the wife not in occupation of what they contend to be one of the jointly owned London apartments.  He offers to maintain the payments of &#163;5,000 per month towards A&#8217;s support and guarantees to secure those payments. </p>

I am told that, between them, these parties have spent a sum of just under &#163;1.4 million. Those costs, paid and unpaid, as between husband and wife have had a significant impact upon the remaining assets which appear on the agreed schedule as currently available to the husband and the wife in the context of her Part III claims.  It was Mr Garrido QC&#8217;s position in closing that, including some disputed properties which she is alleged to own in Egypt, the wife has assets in the order of &#163;2.8 million after payment of her costs including funds paid over in satisfaction of the Egyptian Divorce agreement.  In contrast, he submitted that the husband had assets in the order of &#163;1.5 million after payment of his costs, all of which were entirely non-matrimonial in terms of provenance.  </p>

She has done so in the expectation that, leaving aside any conclusions which this court might reach in relation to the sufficiency of the overall financial benefits which the terms of the Egyptian Divorce agreement provided for her, she will succeed in discharging the burden of proof which she bears in relation to her early allegations of the true extent of the husband&#8217;s wealth and thus the resources available to him to meet her claims.  In contrast, he now claims to be in debt as a result of having to realise personal assets to meet mounting legal costs.  His net annual income for the year ended December 2017 was just over &#163;100,000.  He claims to have no steady income at present having lost his employment in the family business during the currency of these proceedings.</p>

It concerned the disposal of 75% of the S family&#8217;s interest in a University complex in Cairo.  In its early stages, the deal was potentially worth US$1.2 billion.  It is the wife&#8217;s case that the husband had, and has, a legitimate expectation of receiving from his father many millions in US dollars from this deal in the negotiation of which he had played a significant role.</p>

In this context, it is common ground that, unlike his two sisters who are each registered as 20% shareholders, the husband has never held shares in the corporate entity which owned the University although he was well remunerated as an employee during the period during which he was involved in the pre-contract negotiations. </p>

He has been described in these proceedings as &#8220;the black sheep of the family&#8221;, an epithet which &#8211; at the time &#8211; probably had some substance as far as the family was concerned.  In December 2006, at about the same time as these parties met, there was a <span style="font-style:italic">rapprochement</span> between father and son.  Professor S travelled to London and offered to clear his son&#8217;s debts (then some US$4 million or c.&#163;2 million on then prevailing <span style="font-style:italic">fx </span>rates) on the basis that he would then be free to return to Egypt to assist in running a new university which Professor S was setting up in Cairo.  That move was described during the course of the hearing as a &#8220;financial bail-out&#8221; and it is probably an apt description.  Its relevance lies in the fact that it is accepted by all the parties to this litigation (including the wife) that, when the husband returned to live in Cairo in 2007, he was more or less completely broke.  That appears to be the basis upon which he started married life with his new wife.  He was aware at the time that she had independent wealth of her own although the wife told me that he never enquired about the extent of her financial resources.</p>

She maintains that the plan was to acquire a smaller property initially whilst they looked for a larger and more permanent family home in the capital.  She describes how they made an initial trip to London in October 2008 when she was six months pregnant with their son. During that trip, they were in contact with several agents and viewed at least one property.</p>

His birth coincided with the final arrangements for the purchase of the first of the London property acquisitions in an apartment block in Central London (&#8220;Flat 117&#8221;).  Contracts for the purchase were exchanged a week after A&#8217;s birth and the sale concluded on 2 March 2009.  By that time, the parties had returned to Cairo and there they remained as a family for the next two and a half years.  They did not use the apartment although the husband&#8217;s sisters and their friends did stay there on occasions when they visited London. </p>

Without accessing her capital (which she accepts was preserved), she must have been aware that he needed to work in order to finance the family&#8217;s lifestyle.  Even on this level of remuneration, it must have been clear to her (given she tells me that they shared every detail of his life in the family business) that this was not an income which, without more, would sustain a life of first class and business travel with all the trappings she describes as a regular incidence of their lifestyle from the early days of the marriage.  It is difficult to see how, in these circumstances, he would have been in a position to fund what she describes as their joint intention on their move to London to build up a portfolio of London property investments.

The following summer, on 23 August 2012, she and A left the family home in Cairo and moved into Flat 117.

Whilst acknowledging that she wished to obtain British citizenship, he contends that one of the reasons for her move was her wish to make the move with one of her sons from her first marriage so as to avoid the compulsory military conscription to which he would be subject as an Egyptian resident.  The husband&#8217;s evidence is that there were serious difficulties within their relationship by this stage and those difficulties were exacerbated by the unhappy relationship which the wife had with the children from his first marriage.  He contends that he had always intended her move with A to be temporary and of no more than three or four years&#8217; duration.  By that time his elder sons would be independent and living away from their family home and she and her elder son would have acquired British citizenship so as to enable them to travel freely between the two countries.</p>

There were discussions in the family and both sisters confirmed to me their agreement that she should be permitted to live in Flat 117 notwithstanding that they would lose their rental income and the opportunity to use the flat as a base whilst travelling in London.  Both Amal and Lina support the husband&#8217;s case that this was to be a temporary move at the end of which the wife and A would return to live in Cairo.  Indeed, Lina appears to have recognised the strains which such a move might place on the marriage.  In her written evidence she recounts several &#8220;difficult family discussions&#8221; during which she sought to point out the potential problems of splitting a family between two different countries.  She said that she cautioned the wife about the cultural implications of an Egyptian husband and wife living apart from one another for long periods of time.</p>

In her written evidence, the wife refers to this period of their marriage as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;long distance family life and marriage breakdown&#8221;</span> which she dates between 2012 and 2015.

It is a deeply personal communication written by one spouse to another at a time when he could not possibly have known that it would end up as one of many thousands of pages of documents in a major piece of litigation.  On any view, it would be impossible to construe that email as a husband demanding of his wife a divorce.  That is expressly what he seeks to avoid.  His intention is plainly to separate without a divorce and, if necessary, without advertising the fact of their separation to anyone.  With some justification, in my view, he recounts that this is more or less the manner in which they were already living their lives.</p>

That was a case which concerned a dispute over the beneficial ownership of property acquired by an unmarried couple over the course of a 17 year relationship.  The legal titles to the properties in issue were held in their joint names but the appellant claimed that he had provided the majority of the purchase funds for the various acquisitions.  Both parties gave conflicting accounts of their respective intentions at the time of purchase.  The judge at first instance held that there was a distinction to be drawn in the application of the <span style="font-style:italic">Stack v Dowden </span>principle when the property in question was primarily purchased as an investment rather than as a home.  Because the respondent had not rebutted the presumption of a resulting trust, he concluded she was not entitled to an equal share of the underlying value of the property portfolio.  That decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal on the basis that there was cogent evidence that the respective intentions of the parties at the time was that the respondent should have an equal share.  The appellant&#8217;s appeal to the Board was allowed and the case remitted to the Supreme Court in the Bahamas. </p>

He was employed by his father as the General Director of N University.  He had only been working in that capacity for two years.  He was maintaining the wife and, as she accepts, he had no assets of his own at that stage save for any savings which he may have made from his income. I have no evidence about that and thus do not speculate although, given his income and the standard of living described by the wife, it is difficult to see how he could have accumulated much in terms of savings.  As I have said, the husband&#8217;s case is that the family home in Cairo which was purchased about a year into the marriage was funded by means of a gift from his father, a position which was not challenged by the wife.</p>

The family had longstanding connections with the capital dating back to the time when Professor S studied for his PhD in London in the 1960s.  I heard from each of the second, third and fourth respondents that they and their families were regular visitors to London.  The evidence of the S family is that the husband was given the task of identifying a suitable investment property given his recent experience of several years living and working in the capital.  They told me that he was better placed to secure a mortgage given his previous residence and employment history.</p>

There is evidence in the papers of three transfers sent from the Professor&#8217;s Arab Bank account to the husband&#8217;s Lloyds account in July and August 2008.  Those funds were subsequently transferred by the husband to the London conveyancing solicitors.  Contracts were exchanged a week later on 27 January 2009.

He points to the &#8216;churn&#8217; of funds in the husband&#8217;s account which makes it impossible to trace the funds pound for pound into the transfer which was made to the conveyancing solicitors in respect of the deposit. That challenge comes as part and parcel of his challenge to the respondents&#8217; case and his allegation on behalf of the wife that the documents allegedly produced and signed in Egypt are forgeries and sham transactions.  That, it seems to me, is a separate issue.  In terms of the initial funding of Flat 117, if the provenance of the &#163;240,000 shortfall was not Professor S&#8217;s resources advanced in accordance with his intention to enable his three children to acquire a London property or family base, the question arises as to where those funds came from and who provided them?  The husband maintains he did not then have the resources which would have enabled him to pay.  His sisters have each confirmed that their father advanced the funds required to complete the purchase on the basis that each of his three children would share in the beneficial ownership of the property.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Professor S&#8217;s evidence, supported by his children, is that the family was anxious to take steps to resolve any ambiguity about the beneficial ownership of Flat 117 by formalising the ownership structure in a legal document drawn up by his Egyptian lawyers.  He told me that, as a family, they had some reservations about the extent to which they could trust the wife&#8217;s intentions given that she had come into their midst as an &#8220;outsider&#8221;.   There is reference in the evidence of all three interveners to the fact that there was some surprise when, in the Summer of 2008, she announced she was pregnant.  Given that both the husband and wife already had grown families from their previous marriages, they had apparently announced that they did not intend to have children.  There is some support for that position in the wife&#8217;s own evidence.  She confirms that, having already had children, neither she nor the husband planned that she should become pregnant since having children together was &#8220;not a priority&#8221;.  Whether or not that was the case, the wife had already made it known amongst the family that she and the husband intended to relocate to London in due course in order to enable her to secure British citizenship.  It was in these circumstances that the family told me that they felt it was important to ensure the arrangements they had agreed in relation to the ownership of Flat 117 were recorded formally in a legal document.  The husband acknowledges that it was highly unusual for the family to have documented a shared ownership arrangement but this step was taken at his father&#8217;s instigation because he had concerns about his relationship with the wife.</p>

According to Mr Salaheldin&#8217;s evidence, he was asked to prepare a contract reflecting the husband&#8217;s (and the family&#8217;s) intentions that all three of Professor S&#8217;s children should share in the beneficial ownership of Flat 117.

The document records that: the husband is the legal owner of Flat 117; the title was transferred into his sole name because of his frequent presence in this jurisdiction and his ability to secure a loan on the property; and his confirmation that he acts as the representative of the partnership in terms of his own and his sisters&#8217; interests.  It records his wish to &#8220;sell and distribute a two-thirds share&#8221; so that each of the three siblings should become equal owners.  Thereafter, the contract records the formal transfer of his legal interest as to one third to each of his two sisters on the basis that each would thereafter share all costs and &#8220;instalments due on the property&#8221; in equal shares.

An offer was made on one particular property which fell through.  They returned to Egypt and were contacted shortly after their return when they were informed that another apartment, Flat 117, was available in the same development.  They did not return to London to view the property but put in an offer which was accepted.  It is no part of the wife&#8217;s case that the property was purchased as a long-term family home in London.

It was managed throughout this period by Mr Tawadross, the husband&#8217;s agent, who collected the rent and carried out whatever work was necessary at the behest of either the tenants or the S family.   There is no doubt that the extended family made use of the flat over those three years.  Amal&#8217;s evidence is that she stayed at Flat 117 frequently between 2009 and 2012.  She says that the short term lets were intended to assist in funding the outgoings.  Lina&#8217;s (unchallenged) evidence was that she stayed at the flat at least once a year between 2009 and 2012 and often with friends.  Her children were regular visitors to the UK during the summer months and she travelled with them to stay at Flat 117.  I have evidence from three of Lina&#8217;s female friends, each of whom confirms that they stayed at Flat 117 at the invitation of the family in March 2009 and May 2010.  It is clear from at the informal statement in the bundle from at least one of those visitors that she was under the impression that Flat 117 was Lina&#8217;s property.  Lina herself states that it was common knowledge amongst many of her friends and family that Flat 117 was effectively her London home.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the financial arrangements between the three S siblings between 2009 and 2012, I was told by all three about an informal arrangement whereby the husband would from time to time tally up any outstanding costs which were not covered by the rental income.   He told me, as did his sisters, that the family would gather for Friday supper at one of the family homes in Cairo and it was on these occasions that family business was discussed, including &#8211; from time to time - any accounting necessary in relation to the London flat.  Both sisters told me that their contributions were made either in cash or through bank transfers.  It is accepted that there are no formal records of account in relation to these transactions. I do have in the documents some contemporaneous records maintained by Mr Tawadross.  These record receipt of rents and the payment of various items of expenditure such as maintenance costs and repairs, various kitchen items purchased (later in 2012) at the request of both the wife and the family and, in one particular instance in September 2011 (prior to the wife&#8217;s occupation of the flat), the cost of meeting delivery charges for a pair of Professor S&#8217;s ear plugs.

I can recall being keenly aware of the fact that this agreement was to the detriment of Lina and myself as it deprived us of the ability to use the property whilst we were in London as well as the rental income which we could have expected to receive.  I was however prepared to make these sacrifices on a short term basis in an effort to assist my brother and his wife.

Lina was staying in London, as was her habit during part of the summer months.  They met at a well-known coffee franchise in London&#8217;s Oxford Street.  Lina was clear that she had expressed to the wife her significant surprise and regret once she became aware of the wife&#8217;s Part III application.  It appears to be accepted that the family was not immediately notified by the husband about the proceedings.  This particular meeting appears to have been set up between the sisters-in-law in order that Lina could inform herself, and thus the wider family, about the nature of the claims which the wife was making in this jurisdiction. She recalls asking the wife how she felt able to advance claims in respect of Flat 117 and the<span style="font-family:Garamond"> LM Flat</span> when she knew full well about the family ownership of those properties.  The response she received from the wife was that she was seeking security for herself and A and that was all she cared about.  The wife accepts making that statement to Lina but maintains now (as she did then) that she was not privy to the nature of any arrangements which the family had made in relation to the two properties.</p>

By this stage, the equity in Flat 117 had increased to the extent that the husband was able to secure a remortgage with FNB Bank which was thereafter secured on both properties.  Flat 507 was purchased on 17 December 2013 for just under &#163;500,000.  The purchase was registered at the Land Registry on 16 January 2014. There was a shortfall of some &#163;22,000 to which all three siblings contributed in equal shares.  The husband&#8217;s evidence is that the shortfall was in fact &#163;23,450 which included a &#8216;lock out&#8217; deposit of some &#163;5,000.  Amal and Lina have confirmed that they paid their respective contributions to the husband in Egypt.  According to Lina&#8217;s evidence, it was their common practice to use cash to account to one another for any dealings or settling of accounts in relation to the two London properties.  She recalls sending cash by messenger to the husband&#8217;s home in Cairo which he then converted to sterling and remitted to London.</p>

At least one of the husband&#8217;s elder sons was resident in Flat 507 for about a year.  In 2015 both the sons moved into a rented apartment in the same block as Flat 117.</p>

According to Mr Salaheldin&#8217;s evidence, he was approached by the husband a few days after New Year&#8217;s Day in 2014.  During that telephone call, the husband asked him to prepare a separate sale contract for Flat 507.  The task was once again delegated to Mr Al-Shabory.  Although dated 16 March 2014, there was some suggestion during the course of the oral evidence that the document had in fact been created by Mr Al-Shabory on 4 March 2014.  Whilst Mr Al-Shabory has no recollection of the precise date, he was clear in his evidence that at some point shortly after he had drafted the contract, all three siblings (the husband and his two sisters) attended on the same occasion in his Cairo office where they signed the 2014 Sale Contract.  Its terms were very similar to those set out in the 2009 Sale Contract and made provision for all three to hold identical interests in the property as to one-third each.</p>

The initial offer from the owners of the investment fund related to the acquisition of the entire Group together with all the underlying corporate assets.  Professor S&#8217;s original intention had been to retire from academic and business life when the sale was concluded.  However, there were various issues which emerged over the course of the commercial negotiations which resulted in a change to those plans.  When the contract was finally signed in 2016, it was only the University which was sold.  Professor S retained ownership of the Academies and the related business entities.  He put on hold his plans to retire and, on his evidence, embarked on a revision of his financial planning.</p>

Some four months later, the husband was notified that he would be required to pay just over &#163;4.2 million together with stamp duty in order to complete the purchase of the long leasehold title.  Because of the fixed term nature of the bonds held within his Credit Suisse account (themselves the product of the Professor&#8217;s earlier payment to the husband of US$5 million), he had to leverage his contribution to the final payment by means of a loan of &#163;2,040,00 against those Credit Suisse funds.  The balance of just under &#163;2.8 million was provided directly by his father who arranged to transfer the funds to Charles Russell Speechlys LLP on 23 September 2016.

I do not accept the wife&#8217;s case that, prior to the receipt of the husband&#8217;s email in November 2015, there were no discussions about the problems in their relationship or that divorce had never been a topic of discussion between them.  It is plain to me from reading the various exchanges of messages between the parties and from my observations of her in the witness box that the wife has a tendency to exaggerated emotional responses.  This would not be the first couple who found themselves falling back on the injection of unexpected wealth to mitigate the pressures of a marriage which was becoming increasingly loveless and unhappy for both, as I find it was by this stage.</p>

The wife lays great store on the standard of living which the family enjoyed during their marriage.   Fast cars, motor bikes and expensive watches were accoutrements in which the husband indulged himself regularly.  Whilst the cars may have been acquired in the guise of some form of business enterprise, he himself accepted that he did not make very much profit from his &#8220;motor trades&#8221;.  The wife is reported to have set much store in her acquisition of designer clothes and handbags.

The husband&#8217;s expectations were no doubt underpinned by the discussions which he and his sisters had had with Professor S.  Whether or not the wife was privy to those family discussions living as she was in London, I have no doubt that she had been informed of developments by the husband.  I find that it is highly likely that he gave to his wife some highly embellished accounts of his expectations on this front.  He is clearly a man whose sense of validation and self-worth flows not only from personal and business achievements but also from the trappings which those successes bring in their wake.  To that extent, I accept the suggestion put to him by his own counsel, Mr Garrido, that the husband is no stranger to personal vanity.  I have little doubt that the husband&#8217;s decision to live apart from the wife, communicated in his email sent in November 2015, came at a time when she was anticipating a life of ongoing financial security where she and the husband would be independently wealthy without recourse to the Professor&#8217;s largesse.</p>

It is the Professor&#8217;s evidence that his son paid not one penny of his own money towards the cost of either although he accepts that, in common with the rest of the family, he has from time to time been allowed to use the yacht.  There is no evidence that the husband has made any financial contribution towards the costs of maintaining the yacht or that he has had the resources to do so.  I was shown several photographs of various family groups with their friends enjoying holidays or trips on the yacht.  I am satisfied that, as an amenity or resource, it has been made available to the whole S family and the friends who have from time to time been invited to accompany individual family members on these trips.   Professor S denies that he gifted the purchase funds to his son although he accepts that the yacht was purchased in his son&#8217;s name albeit not for his son&#8217;s benefit.  </p>

The outcome to that enquiry is essentially binary.  Whilst there may be aspects of the evidence relied on by both the applicant and the respondents which lack essential credibility and/or which are contradictory or inconsistent with other aspects of their respective accounts, this is a case where one of two things happened:  either the respondents signed the documents which are alleged to have been produced by the Egyptian lawyers on or around the dates which are now being advanced or they did not.  If, as a family, they are deliberately lying to this court in order to resist what they may believe to be financial claims which have no merit (at best) or which they perceive to be predatory (at worst), then the inference must inevitably be that these instruments were manufactured on a fraudulent basis and for the purposes of this litigation.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to bear in mind that in this case the wife did not observe these events.  On her case (disputed in part by the family) she was not privy to the property-related discussions which are said to have taken place prior to the acquisition of the three properties and the yacht. In these circumstances, she is driven to formulate her case upon the basis of representations made to her by the husband.  Those representations have to be seen in the context of what she has been able to tell the court in relation to her own participation in events leading up to the property acquisitions.  I have already found that it is highly probable that the husband presented her with an incomplete and somewhat exaggerated impression of the wealth and spending power which the completion of the University sale to the A Group would bring in its wake.  She believed that the husband would be treated equally with his two siblings in relation to the dispersal of that wealth.  She acknowledged during the course of her evidence that, over and above the US$15 million figure which she had been told about by the husband, she knew very little about Professor S&#8217;s intentions.  Her information amounted to no more than reportage from the husband.  In response to a question from Mr Amos during cross-examination, she told me that after the sale of the University, she understood that the Professor had divided his money between his three children and kept some for himself.  Each was then entitled to invest that money as he or she chose.  The plan which she and the husband had settled upon was to invest in real estate in London.  </p>

The evidence is that the consideration for the sale was not paid in full until May 2016, some five months after she and the husband had divorced.  I can well understand how the timing of the advertised recall of the first tranche of US$5 million, coinciding &#8211; as it did &#8211; with the final breakdown of the marriage has raised grave concerns in this wife&#8217;s mind about the truth of the case which the respondents now put before this court.  Indeed, it is right to record that, on her behalf, Mr Warshaw and Mr Viney have left no stone unturned in their forensic efforts to challenge the respondents&#8217; case.</p>

Over the years since the failure of her first marriage, she has been the beneficiary of substantial financial support from her own family.  This financial support has taken the form of the provision of a home for over ten years as well as the direct transfer of substantial funds to accounts in her name.  She accepts that her own father is entitled to recall those funds (although she told me he would not remove her assets so as to see her in financial difficulty) and that he has had the use of funds held in Switzerland in her name through the use of a credit card facility.  Her father provided the funds in their entirety for her investment with her brother in the investment property which they purchased in April 2011.</p>

The documents initially produced by the husband with his Form E were each dated to match either the dates of registration in the office copy entries or, in the case of <span style="font-family:Garamond">the LM Flat</span>, the registration of the long leasehold interest.  The documents produced by the Egyptian lawyers as evidence of work done and payment received were drafted to coincide with those dates.  Without further explanation, any objective reader might reasonably conclude that those documents were created on the same dates as the contracts themselves.  </p>

There is now an acceptance by both the family and the Egyptian lawyers that the three documents were in fact created on the date appearing in the underlying metadata, dates which &#8211; in all three case &#8211; post-date the contract dates by a matter of weeks.</p>

Miss Akthar&#8217;s evidence (which was not the subject of formal challenge) went some way to resolving that issue: she said that the documents supplied to her and copied into the husband&#8217;s Form E exhibit bundle were originals.  What then of the apparent differences in the various iterations of the documents which are now before the court?  As I have said, there is no expert evidence in relation to these formatting differences, albeit that they are small discrepancies.  We have all had to proceed on the basis of what we can see from the face of the documents.   The sales contracts/agreement record on their face that more than one copy was produced. Are those discrepancies adequately explained by the manner in which the different electronic versions were stored on flash drives and subsequently transferred from one computer screen to another?   Alternatively, are Mr Warshaw and Mr Viney correct when they submit that the only logical conclusion is that the documents were not printed and signed at the same time?</p>

The Word Document File metadata shows that all three documents were accessed and modified at a date much later than the internal metadata.  One possible explanation is that, since the document was last accessed and modified, it has been emailed and the destination computer has created a new copy of the document with file metadata set to the date and time of receipt.  However, this is a hypothesis which would require the construction of a processing history and chronology of the three documents before it could be evidenced as a fact.&#8221;</p>

When a word document is saved or closed, the internal metadata is updated and saved, and the file containing the Word document is saved within the file system at roughly the same time, so there should be alignment of the properties.  But if a Word Document file is transferred to another computer, or to a portable storage device, the operating system creates a copy of the file at the new location.  Depending on the software module used to copy the file, some or all of the file&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">[sic] </span>created, modified or last accessed metadata may be modified by the copy process.  Therefore the internal metadata dates and the file metadata dates may diverge, despite no irregularity occurring in the processing.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.29in">The three documents for examination also suggest that, at the time they were printed, they resided in the e-mail cache folder of the host computer.  A Word Document sent as an attachment to an e-mail will be encoded and attached as an additional component of a multi-part e-mail.  After delivery to its destination, the attachment will be decoded and a new file created to contain an exact copy of the Word Document.  But at the new destination, the operating system will create in its directory new metadata for the Word Document file.  So the content of the internal metadata of the Word Document will be unchanged, but it will no longer align completely with the internal metadata.  There is only limited scope, according to the type of operating system in use, to preserve the file system metadata after an e-mail transfer of an attachment.&#8221;</p>

He has maintained several professional and other links with England and the United States.  He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (UK) and of the American Society for World Scholars.  He is a board member of several NGOs in Egypt and, recreationally, a member of prominent shooting and yachting clubs in Egypt.  Over the years he has received many prizes and honorary awards from various national and international bodies.  This is information which I glean from his curriculum vitae, the contents of which were not the subject of any challenge on behalf of the wife.</p>

Whilst there was a period of estrangement over a number of years whilst the husband was living in England, that rift appears to have been bridged in 2006 when the Professor reached out to the husband and persuaded him to return to the family fold on the basis of the clean financial bill of health which the Professor was willing to underwrite.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already referred to some of the husband&#8217;s personality traits and characteristics. He was cross-examined at some length about the two sales contracts for Flat 117 (2009) and Flat 507 (2014) involving his two sisters.  He was clear in his account that his intention in signing the two documents was to confirm the three siblings&#8217; joint ownership of the properties.  He told me that in 2009, his father&#8217;s principal concern had been to protect the sisters&#8217; interests in the event of his death in order that their &#8216;inheritance&#8217; should not pass to the wife.  This, he explained, was the reason why she had been described as an &#8216;outsider&#8217; in family terms.  He said that there was no real issue about the 2009 Sale Contract since no one expected him to die.  As the marriage went on and the difficulties within it became more apparent, he told me that his father&#8217;s concerns changed over time.  By the time the 2014 Sale Contract relating to Flat 507 was signed, A had been born; the family was divided and living in separate countries.  By this stage, the Professor was expressing concerns about the wife&#8217;s intentions.  I accept this as a true statement insofar as it concerned the dynamics in 2013/2014 of the Professor&#8217;s relationship with the wife.  At one point in his own evidence, and unprompted, he told me that he and his daughters had been proved right in relation to their collective concerns.</p>

He further accepts that he represented on the mortgage application form that he held assets worth &#163;2 million and made no mention of the fact that purchase funds were being gifted to him and his siblings by their father.  He told me that, having been charged by the family to identify and purchase their initial London investment property, his concern was simply to satisfy the bank that he had the funds to complete the purchase.  He explained that the &#8220;drive&#8221; to purchase in London at that point in time was motivated primarily by the fact that the Egyptian currency had crashed in value on the international exchange markets.  The family was keen to limit its exposure and invest in sterling in the central London property market.</p>

I am acutely aware that there have been parallel proceedings in the Family Division concerning A and that things said and done in those proceedings may well have coloured the wife&#8217;s (and her team&#8217;s) impression of this husband as a witness and litigator.  I accept that some of his actions may have been overbearing.  I am also prepared to accept the wife&#8217;s evidence that he was aggressive in his correspondence when she indicated an intention to continue with her Part III claim notwithstanding the apparent agreement reached in the context of the Egyptian divorce.  He was, nevertheless, steadfast in his denial that he had fabricated any of the three sale contracts and/or that he had forged the signatures of either his sisters or his father on those documents.</p>

In my judgment, not only does that demonstrate Amal&#8217;s acceptance and understanding of the revocable nature of any funds advanced by her father; it also reveals that she is an astute financial operator who clearly balanced the advantages of not terminating the fixed term deposits against the cost of financing the loan which she took out to repay her father.</p>

He had available to him many of the trappings of significant wealth even if it was not obvious to those around him, including &#8211; at times &#8211; the wife, that the provenance of much of this apparent wealth was the generosity of his father.</p>

I do not close my eyes to the extent of the position of power and influence which the Professor and, to a lesser extent, the husband are likely to have been perceived to hold in the eyes of the Egyptian lawyers, each of whom has a close working relationship either with each other or with the family.  The coincidence of the respective accounts from all seven of the alleged &#8220;co-conspirators&#8221; would not, of itself, have persuaded me of the truth of those accounts.  Rather, I have looked at the wider canvas of the evidence.  I have taken into account the family dynamic as it emerged so clearly during the course of nearly two weeks of evidence.  I observed the Professor and his two daughters at close quarters in the court room not only during their time in the witness box but also as they sat together in the well of the court.  I have found each to be a witness of truth.  I believe them when they tell me that they have not conspired together with their lawyers to manufacture the case upon which the wife relies by way of a defence to their counterclaim in these proceedings.  Small points can sometimes be telling.  It would have been very easy (not to say convenient) had Mr Salaheldin&#8217;s evidence been that he observed the signing of both sales contracts involving the three siblings.  That was not his evidence.  He observed at first hand the signing of the documents relating to Flat 117 but was not present five years later when the contract for Flat 507 was signed.</p>

Whatever electronic or technical differences there may be in the eighteen iterations of the three sets of documents which are now before the court, I do not consider those differences or the absence of explanation in relation to some of the issues arising from the underlying metadata, to displace my findings in relation to the fundamental credibility of the family witnesses from whom I heard.   </p>

The trusts, and each of them, operate as a matter of law from the date of creation (here, May 2009 and March 2014).  There is no doubt that, absent a finding of sham, the husband was entitled as the legal owner of the properties to declare such trusts for the benefit of his two sisters.  The requirements of s. 53(1) (b) and (c) of the Law of Property Act 1953 are thus met in that the husband is a person &#8220;who is able to declare such trust&#8221; and, by his signature to the two Sale Contracts, he has &#8220;manifested and proved by some writing&#8221; his intention to declare such trust.  The two Sales Contracts of 2009 and 2014 constitute the necessary declarations on the part of the husband and a sufficient memorandum of his intentions in relation to each of the properties.  Even without the evidence of the Sale Contracts, s. 53(1)(b) and (c) of the 1953 Act would be met in this case because of what I have found to be the clear intention of the husband in 2009 and 2014 to formalise and record the beneficial interests of his two sisters in the properties.  I accept that each made their respective financial contributions to the purchase price of each property either by way of a direct contribution in the case of both properties, and/or (in the case of Flat 507) through re-mortgaging the equity which represented their beneficial interests in Flat 117.</p>

Given my findings in relation to the existence of a clear declaration of trust in the sisters&#8217; favour, it is not necessary for me to go further.  However, in my judgment this particular analysis sits less happily with the expressed intentions of the parties as I have found them to be.  Were the two Sale Contracts executory contracts for sale, the parties would still be required to take steps to complete the transactions and perfect the sales contracts (i.e. presumably the transfers of the legal titles into their joint names on the basis of full consideration received).  On the basis of the evidence I heard and my findings in relation to the family&#8217;s intentions at the time of each acquisition, the more appropriate legal interpretation in my judgment is the resulting or constructive trust route.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The position in relation to the acquisition of the<span style="font-family:Garamond"> LM Flat</span> and the 2016 Agreement Contract is different.  Under the terms of the document which Mr Salaheldin drafted at the request of Professor S, the husband &#8211; in executing the document &#8211; has acknowledged that he acted as his father&#8217;s agent for the purposes of acquiring the property; that all &#8220;dues&#8221; (recorded as &#163;6,640,575) have been paid by his father; and that he has no rights or entitlement to the property on the basis that his father &#8220;only shall benefit from all profits resulting from the transactions executed on the property&#8221;.  In circumstances where I have found that the funds used to acquire the property emanated from the Professor, the 2016 document operates as a matter of English law to create a trust of the property for his absolute benefit.  In this context, I am aware of the argument advanced on behalf of the wife to the effect that the sum of US$5 million advanced to the husband might be construed as an outright gift and thus the leverage of those funds through borrowings becomes a financial contribution from the resources of the husband.  I am satisfied that the proper construction of that transaction between the Professor and his son was that of a contingent gift.  Professor S acknowledged in response to a question from Mr Warshaw that it could be loosely construed as a gift but the funds were always subject to recall should circumstances change.  That is what the husband acknowledges to have happened with the<span style="font-family:Garamond"> LM Flat.</span> When it became impossible to reverse the sale transaction, and in circumstances where the husband had no resources to complete the purchase, the Professor was obliged to step into his shoes.  The funds required to complete the transaction were provided by Professor S through further leverage of the Credit Suisse deposits and through a further injection of cash from his own resources.  In signing the 2016 Agreement Contract (as I accept he did), the husband, as legal owner, declared a voluntary trust of his entire interest in the property for his father&#8217;s benefit.  </p>

I was shown a letter dated 15 November 2015 from an on-call out of hours &#8220;Night Doctor&#8221; service.  Dr Haroon had attended Flat 117 shortly before 11pm.  The husband was present during that visit and I assume that his presence coincided with the promise he made to travel to London to discuss matters with the wife after sending his November email about the future of their marriage. The wife described his two day visit as &#8220;the most unmerciful days in my life&#8221;. I have already made reference to her seemingly hysterical response in the WhatsApp exchanges which followed the receipt of his email.  The GP&#8217;s record of his visit records a reported history of depression, anxiety and panic attacks which the wife had suffered in the past.  She was advised to seek psychiatric counselling.  The wife told me she had experienced a nervous collapse on that day.  The next letter in relation to the medical evidence before the court is a further letter from the out of hours service dated 12 May 2017 some 18 months later.  That letter relates to a visit made to Flat 117 by Dr Haroon on 1 April 2017 about a week after she had formally instigated her Part III proceedings.  It records epigastric (or lower abdomen rib) pain and the fact she was then under a lot of stress.  She was not at the time registered with a GP which suggests to me that she had not undertaken any formal therapeutic treatment or intervention between November 2015 and the beginning of April 2017.</p>

The wife maintains that Professor S sent her the original terms of the family&#8217;s offer in a WhatsApp message.  Her belief was that those were terms proposed at the time by the husband supported by his father. The Professor denied that he had sent any such message and told me he would not have known how to attach such a document to a WhatsApp message in any event.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have within the bundles a printout of the wife&#8217;s WhatsApp account for 14 December 2015 when it is alleged the document was sent.  She has confirmed she was in Egypt and using her Egyptian mobile telephone when it was received.  I have also seen a document written in Arabic which bears, or appears to bear, a formal professional letter heading identifying the sender as a lawyer called Hassan Abd Moneim Hassan.  It is dated 12 December 2015.  Neither the wife nor the husband nor Professor S has any knowledge about this lawyer.  None of them knows who he is and each denies any contact or prior dealings with him.  A formal translation of that document is in the bundle.  I have been able to compare it with a formal translation of the Egyptian Divorce agreement which the wife accepts was signed by Mr Serry on her behalf acting through a power of attorney which she signed.  The terms are similar and the drafting layout (in terms of a preamble and recitals) look remarkably similar.  I know not whether this document emanated from Mr Serry, nor whether he was involved in its production because I heard no evidence from him.  What I can see is that the English translation of the Egyptian Divorce agreement which was signed by the husband and by Mr Serry as the wife&#8217;s attorney has been formally translated into English by &#8220;Serry Law Office&#8221;.  That translation bears a formal stamp from Mr Serry&#8217;s office.  When it was put to him by Mr Warshaw that the document had been produced by a lawyer whom he had instructed, the husband denied the suggestion.</p>

That counter-proposal was silent as to the sum of EGP 5 million which was being offered as a capital settlement.  She did not ask for a greater capital sum.  Her counter-offer proposed an increase from EGP 30,000 to EGP 40,000 per month (to include the cost of employees and a driver) if A and the wife were to return to live in Egypt.  It requested that the property which the husband agreed to provide in Egypt as a home for A should be held in her name with A as her successor in title.  It sought an increase from &#163;5,000 to &#163;8,000 per month for A&#8217;s maintenance whilst they were living in England.  In the event that she and A were living in Egypt &#8220;next year&#8221; (i.e. in 2016), she sought payment of the school fees at the British International School.  If they lived in the UK, the husband&#8217;s obligation was to be the payment of school fees in England.  In addition, she wanted him to cover the cost of flights with A both from the UK and internally in Egypt.  It is the wife&#8217;s case that she never received a response to that counter-proposal.  She accepts that she was its author.  I replicate its terms on the basis of the wife&#8217;s own translation of the document:-</p>

The wife was present and she accepted during the course of cross-examination that she had been an active &#8220;driver&#8221; in those discussions.  It appears that there were probably two separate meetings in which the two fathers were involved. (The wife accepts she mentioned nothing about these meetings in her written evidence.)  The wife acknowledges that she asked Professor S to secure A&#8217;s future if there was to be a divorce.  She acknowledges that there were discussions about specific figures during which the Professor told her that he believed the sum of EGP 5 million which he was agreeing to underwrite as a settlement was too much.  She accepts, too, that the Professor said that negotiations in relation to the monthly maintenance payments would be something she had to discuss with the husband. </p>

He agreed that he proposed the figure of EGP 5 million.  He told me that initially the wife said she was not interested in money because she was independently wealthy in her own right.

She confirmed to me that he was a trusted family retainer of some twenty years&#8217; standing.   The husband&#8217;s account is that Mr Serry sent him an email which set out the terms of the proposed agreement.  He disagreed with one aspect which was that, if the wife died, A should live with his maternal grandmother.   He said that A should in these circumstances live with him.  That appears to have been agreed since it does not appear in the signed version of the Egyptian Divorce agreement.  He was subsequently notified by the wife and her father that Mr Serry would attend his offices at the Academy in order to formalise matters.  Mr Serry duly arrived with two hard copies of the final version of the agreement.  The husband handed over a cheque for EGP5 million which his father had given him, they signed the two copies of the agreement together with the formal divorce papers which Mr Serry signed using the power of attorney which had been given to him by the wife.  The agreement was formally witnessed by a Mr Kamal and a second witness who attended the meeting with the registrar.</p>

It is a simple statement of fact that I have not had the benefit of any evidence at all from Mr Serry or from the wife&#8217;s father and brother who, on her own account, were active participants in the negotiations which preceded the Egyptian Divorce agreement.  I have already dealt with the medical evidence in this case, such as it is.  I do not regard that medical evidence, on its own, as sufficient to persuade me that this wife was not an able and active participant in the several discussions she had both directly with the husband and, thereafter, with Professor S in the presence of her own father and brother.  She accepts that she formulated her own counter-proposals.  By this stage she had already had advice from a leading firm of English matrimonial specialists which must be presumed to have included the potential extent of her claims and the approach which a court would be likely to adopt in the event of an English divorce.  On her instructions, a petition had been issued in London on the very day she left the jurisdiction to travel to Egypt with A.  She had anchored jurisdiction here; there was nothing to suggest that she was not in a position to communicate freely with her English lawyers about the steps she was taking in parallel in Egypt with the assistance of her own family members and a trusted family lawyer.  The wife asserts privilege in relation to her dealings with Mishcon de Reya and that is her right.  In the absence of Mr Serry and her family members from this hearing, she also asserts privilege in relation to his role in the Egyptian Divorce agreement.</p>

As her Form E disclosed some seventeen months later, she had nearly &#163;&#189; million in the form of equity in the London flat which she owned with her brother.  She had cash in UK bank accounts and a portfolio of offshore investments worth over &#163;1.2 million.  Those assets had been generating for her a six figure income (&#163;125,000 per annum) which, with the husband&#8217;s ongoing monthly payments for A, had enabled her to discharge her domestic economy in London where she was living in rent free accommodation.  She was the owner of a number of expensive motor cars provided for her by the husband including a Bentley, a BMW, a Mercedes and a Range Rover.  She has not been working during the intervening period and thus her capital has not been inflated by income receipts generated by her own efforts.  Whilst her Form E reveals the existence of a bank loan of just over &#163;60,000, this loan appears to have been incurred to meet credit card debts and (possibly) the costs generated by the issue of her Part III claim.  The provenance of that wealth is almost entirely non-matrimonial, as I accept, leaving aside the cash sum which the husband through his father provided as a term of the Egyptian Divorce agreement.  I am satisfied that this sum was indeed underwritten by Professor S whose cheque was handed to Mr Serry on the occasion of the signing of the agreement.</p>

Further, her occupation of the London apartment (at a cost to the husband of a further &#163;98,000 per annum) was preserved albeit only during the period throughout which she was responsible for him as a primary carer (which included terms as to her remarriage).

The husband stayed at Flat 507 whenever he visited London to see A.   They maintained what appears to have been a relatively civilised relationship.  The husband accepted that he purchased an expensive watch for the wife and, shortly after the Egyptian divorce, put down a deposit on a new Bentley for her although the order was subsequently cancelled.  She was still permitted to use his credit card accounts although this arrangement came to an abrupt end amidst allegations of significant over-spending on the wife&#8217;s part.

What I heard about thereafter were the ongoing difficulties in resolving issues relating to the husband&#8217;s payment for additional expenses incurred on A&#8217;s behalf.  It is perhaps not without significance that the wife told me that her patience came to an end when he refused to pay an additional &#163;100 for a hockey stick.  </p>

That case concerned a Russian divorce agreement made at a time when the husband did not have the benefit of independent wealth in excess of &#163;40 million which was subsequently gifted to him by his father.  The case turned largely on the wife&#8217;s future housing needs in circumstances where she was living in a central London property owned by an offshore trust of which the husband was a beneficiary.  The Court of Appeal overturned the award of some &#163;1.14 million which I made in the wife&#8217;s favour to meet future needs on the basis that those needs were generated not by the marriage or any inadequacy of the financial provision made at the time of the Russian divorce but rather by the exorbitant costs which had been generated by the English litigation.</p>

The fact that the provision made for the wife in that case in terms of her ability to occupy the London home did not extend beyond the termination of the children&#8217;s minority did not deter the Court of Appeal from determining that the financial provision made was adequate in all the circumstances of that case.</p>

	      </authorialNote>.  Given the wife&#8217;s acceptance of the fact that in December 2015 she was an &#8220;active driver&#8221; in the discussions which were ongoing between her own and the S family (albeit in the absence of the husband) and in the light of her previous lengthy discussions with the husband on the issue, I reject any suggestion that she was placed under undue pressure by him to conclude the agreement on his terms.  Against the background of her very recent instruction of Mishcon de Reya (who remained on the court record at the relevant date), I find it inherently improbable that &#8211; were she under such pressure &#8211; she would not have availed herself of the opportunity to seek further advice from her English solicitors.  She did not withdraw from Mr Serry the power of attorney which she had given him with a mandate to complete the agreement on her behalf.  Whilst she seeks to advance a case now that she told Mr Serry that she intended to take no part in formalising the agreement, there is no suggestion from the wife that she regarded the advice she received from Mr Serry as being deficient or incompetent in any respect.  There is no suggestion that at any point in the negotiations she communicated to her own father or to Mr Serry that she wished to withdraw from the proposed agreement or to revoke the specific power of attorney which she gave him to sign the agreement with the husband on her behalf.  In the absence of any evidence from Mr Serry, I regret that I am unable to accept this aspect of her case.  Once the agreement had been executed and the lump sum paid (and presumably &#8220;banked&#8221; by the wife), there was nothing further said or done by her or her English or Egyptian lawyers to indicate any intention to resile from the agreement.  Its terms were carried through to include an agreement into which the husband entered in March 2017 to purchase in A&#8217;s name an apartment in Egypt which he contends had been chosen and selected by the wife<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="7">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> This apartment was being acquired on the basis of an instalment payment plan.  It appears that the apartment was sold at the beginning of February 2018 for the equivalent of c. &#163;60,000.</p>

On their case, the wife was waiting for the purchase of the LM Flat to be completed so as to advance her Part III claims from the foot of an assertion that he was the legal owner of a London apartment worth some &#163;6 million.  In this context, and with some justification in my judgment, they point to the wildly exaggerated assertions she made in her initial evidence referring to him as a man worth &#163;100 million.</p>

Had the wife proceeded with her English divorce petition and an application for financial remedies in this jurisdiction, there would inevitably have been a fact-finding process at some stage of those proceedings in order to determine beneficial ownership.  I have found that the first two sales contracts relating to Flats 117 and 507 were legitimate instruments which gave rise to the creation of constructive or resulting trusts in favour of the husband&#8217;s sisters.   At the time the Egyptian Divorce agreement was concluded, <span style="font-family:Garamond">the LM Flat</span> was in its very early stages of construction.  It had been purchased &#8220;off plan&#8221; when the 10% deposit was paid some eight weeks prior to the Egyptian agreement.  The husband was frank in his admission that, had the Professor not recalled the sum of US$5 million when the parameters of the University sale contract changed, he and the wife might well have lived in the property.  That never came to pass since they were divorced shortly thereafter.  I have found that the 2016 Agreement Contract operated to create a trust of the entire beneficial interest in his father&#8217;s favour.</p>

She believed those assets to belong to the husband at the time.  She was also aware of the state of her own finances and the investments which she held in Switzerland.  In the light of my findings, it is difficult to see why an English court would or could in those circumstances condemn this agreement to one which had no weight in terms of its legal effect or consequence in a subsequent Part III application.  Given there can be no doubt that its terms were recorded and, with the wife&#8217;s authority, agreed and subsequently implemented, I can find no solid or reasoned basis for holding that this agreement failed the test of fairness as explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Radmacher</span>.  It was certainly adequate in terms of meeting the wife&#8217;s needs given the extent of her own capital resources at the time.  </p>

She agreed to that term and did not seek to extend those rights of occupation by the counter-proposals which she sent to Professor S.

The majority of this couple&#8217;s married life was spent in their matrimonial home in Cairo.

Together these are worth just over &#163;340,000 (as agreed on the &#8220;stripped out&#8221; asset schedule which is now before the court).  That is less than the equity in the wife&#8217;s London investment apartment which is agreed at just under &#163;416,000.  That, in my judgment, is of crucial relevance to the determination and resolution of the wife&#8217;s Part III claims.  I suspect that the prospects of co-ownership with the husband&#8217;s sisters would hold no attraction for either her or them.  The court could order a sale of those two properties in order to realise the husband&#8217;s interest in each but that does not appear to be an appropriate option given the assets which the wife holds (or, at least, has held if one disregards the impact upon her resources of the costs of these proceedings).  As the Court of Appeal has made plain in <span style="font-style:italic">Zimin v Zimina</span>, the court cannot and should not exercise its discretion under Part III simply because the costs of an unmeritorious Part III application have depleted the applicant&#8217;s resources and given rise to a potential situation of need.</p>

To do so would be to make an order which would give her, as claimant, more than she <span style="font-style:italic">could</span> have been awarded had all the proceedings taken place in this jurisdiction.  It would have required the husband to meet an award which could not be justified on the basis of my findings in relation to computation.  Whilst I can well understand why Russell J granted this wife permission to proceed with her Part III claim on the basis of the evidence which was then before the court, that evidence has been challenged and found wanting.   There is no evidential basis for her assertion that this husband has, or had, assets in the order of &#163;100 million either now or in March 2017.</p>

On the basis that the financial arrangements embodied in the Egyptian Divorce agreement are not the subject of a formal order in the Egyptian divorce proceedings (and I proceed on that basis), I have reached the conclusion that his future security (and that of the wife as his primary carer) requires me to make an order in the context of the wife&#8217;s current application under Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>.

It seems to me that there is wider family wealth on both sides of this case.  I am satisfied that the husband has an earning capacity which will enable him to fulfil the obligations he has accepted under the terms of his open offer even if, as he maintains, he is not currently employed.  I find that the wife, for her part, has an earning capacity which will enable her in due course to make a contribution to her future financial needs.  I accept that her time and energies are currently absorbed with the care she is providing for their son.  However, she is a highly intelligent woman who has in the past sustained her own domestic economy for a period of over ten years working at a senior position in journalism.  I suspect that she will not be able to return to her previous level of earnings but, as A&#8217;s needs diminish in time, I can see no reason why she should not find some form of employment even if on a part-time basis.  In the meantime, the raft of financial provision which the husband will be making will provide her with a secure home and an income stream in terms of the support he will be providing for A.</p>

In circumstances where I have determined the extent of the husband&#8217;s assets in this jurisdiction and his inability without further assistance from his father to make a further lump sum payment from his own resources, there is insufficient evidence for me to proceed on the basis of adverse inference alone in relation to ownership of property in Egypt.  As I have said, there are allegations and cross-allegations on both sides of the case that neither of the parties has provided a clear account of the property assets which they may hold in Egypt.  There was very little forensic investigation of these matters during the course of the hearing and neither party has, in my judgment, proved his or her case to the requisite standard of the balance of probabilities in relation to the existence of any such assets.</p>

The wife in this case has failed in her aspirations to establish that the documents giving rise to the wider family&#8217;s beneficial interests in the three London properties were forgeries or sham transactions manufactured by the husband for the purposes of this litigation.  That was the central thrust of her case.  She has invested her own capital in pursuing that case and, following <span style="font-style:italic">Zimin</span>, the husband cannot be required to act as an insurer in respect of those litigation risks even if he had the financial resources to do so.  It will not be forgotten that the respondent in that case had personal wealth of some &#163;40 million but was not required to make up a deficit of some &#163;1.14 million in terms of the wife&#8217;s needs as I assessed them to be.</p>

I regard it as entirely appropriate for the terms of the wife&#8217;s occupation of Flat 117 to be extended until A is 18 years old or until he completes his secondary education.

I am not persuaded that the evidence which is currently before the court provides any legal basis for such a claim.  This was essentially a family arrangement.  Both Lina and Amal have accepted that they were willing to agree to allow their sister-in-law to occupy the property in order that she could build up the necessary period of residence which was necessary for her application for a British passport. By the time that process occurred, the husband and wife were divorced but, until at least the summer of 2016, sustaining a relationship which involved the husband sending a number of mixed messages to the wife.</p>

It seems to me that this is not a straightforward calculation as it is clear from the evidence of both sisters that they have historically expected to absorb significant &#8220;rent holidays&#8221; during periods in any given year during which family members or friends used the flat as a London base, particularly during the summer months.  Inevitably, it seems to me that there will need to be further discussion amongst the family members as to how they will between themselves resolve these issues once they have digested this judgment.  They are not issues for the wife whose occupation of the property will be secured during the period it continues to be her home.</p>
