The court was clearly notified that one of the issues the mother was raising was consent on the part of the father to the removal of the children from Zimbabwe, that removal having taken place as long ago as 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2005.  It is clear from the fifth paragraph of that order that the mother was indicating that she would also raise a defence under Article 13 (b) of the Hague Convention asserting &#8220;intolerability/grave risk based on the general situation in Zimbabwe&#8221;, for the judge provided for the filing of a situation report (if available) from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and a similar report from the United States Department of State.  It is further clear that the mother was raising the issue of the children&#8217;s wishes, for she ordered a member of the Hague abduction team of CAFCASS PRFD to interview the children on that subject. </p>

Although M and T were excited at the prospect of the arrival into their then home of N (they at that time living with their father &#8211; see below for further discussion of this aspect) they have little recollection of her now, having left Zimbabwe only two weeks after her birth.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M and T were born following a customary ceremony of marriage which had taken place between their parents in 1993.  It was not until 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2000 that the parties married under civil law in a ceremony carried out at the Harare Magistrates&#8217; Court.  Very shortly after that ceremony the parties separated, and the evidence establishes (there being no dispute as to this) that the mother voluntarily left the children with the father.  Although she subsequently (2001) submitted an application to the Magistrates&#8217; Court of Mashonaland seeking custody of the children, the application was dismissed when she failed to attend to prosecute it.  It is her case that she was influenced by the father not to go ahead with that case.  It is the father&#8217;s case that she simply did not bother to attend court, and thus her application was dismissed.  He told me in his oral evidence that his own lawyer in Zimbabwe had then informed him that there was automatically an order for custody in his favour; this is clearly erroneous, but accounts for such an assertion of there having been a &#8220;welfare enquiry&#8221; leading to the making of such an order in one of his documents.  I fully accept that the father innocently misunderstood the position, and was not trying to mislead me in the documentation.</p>

It is not at all clear to me whether she is asserting that this was a customary marriage or a marriage under civil law.  In any event the father denies being married to his new partner, for he asserts that he is still lawfully married to the mother (see below).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the father&#8217;s case that thereafter the mother assumed a new identity (Grace Munyaro), and at some unspecified date shortly after January 2002 successfully made her way to England and continued to live here for at least two years with her new husband.  Contrary to that assertion it is the mother&#8217;s case that she went to live in South Africa, stayed with her sister, worked there, and did not leave South Africa (save for brief external trips) for 2&#189; years.

He told me in his oral evidence that whilst he had received telephone calls from the mother and/or the children prior to learning of their address, these were always from the mobile phones or public telephone boxes with the number withheld, so that he had no idea where they were, save that he did know the country.</p>

Armed with this information he consulted a lawyer (Mr. Motsi) the very next day, and went to his offices at close of business likewise on that day, the conference lasting some five hours.  During that time Mr. Motsi made enquiries and discovered the procedures under the Hague Convention.  Thus it was that as late as September 2006 these proceedings began, in contemplation at least.  The father told me in his oral evidence, and I accept, that it is not possible to physically call at the premises of the Central Authority in Zimbabwe.  All communication is by letter or by telephone.  Mr. Motsi wrote on behalf of the father, and had to chase with many following communications until ultimately the Central Authority indicated that they had received the referral and were acting upon it.  Thus many weeks passed in anxiety for the father.  I accept his account.</p>

Knowledge of the facts and that the act of removal or retention is wrongful will normally usually be necessary. But to expect the applicant necessarily to have knowledge of the rights which can be enforced under the Convention is to set too high a standard. The degree of knowledge as a relevant factor will, of course, depend on the facts of each case.&#8221;</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Intolerable&#8221; is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean &#8216;a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate&#8217;. It is, as article 13 (b) makes clear, the return to the requesting state, rather than the enforced removal from the requested state, which must have this effect. Thus the English courts have sought to avoid placing the child in an intolerable situation by extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns by relying on the courts of the requesting state to protect him once he is there. In many cases this will be sufficient. But once again, the fact that this will usually be sufficient to avoid the risk does not mean that it will invariably be so.  In Hague Convention cases within the European Union, article 11.4 of the Brussels 2 Revised Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) number 2201/2003) expressly provides that a court cannot refuse to return a child on the basis of article 13 (b) &#8220;if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return&#8221;. Thus it has to be shown that those arrangements will be effective to secure the protection of the child. With the best will in the world, this will not always be the case. No one intended that an instrument designed to secure the protection of children from the harmful effects of international child abduction should itself be turned into an instrument of harm&#8221;.</p>

That discretion must be exercised in the context of the approach of the Convention - see Re A (Abduction: Custody Rights) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] Fam 106" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] Fam 106</ref>, per Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Earlier in this Judgment I set out the dates upon which the mother and father celebrated their customary marriage, and later their civil marriage.  The father told me in his oral evidence that he had issued divorce proceedings as long ago as 2001, following his separation from the mother, and that he had understood them to be in agreement that there should be a consent divorce.  However, the mother reneged on what he believed to be the arrangement and refused to consent.  She then left the country, and he has not pursued divorce proceedings subsequently, although he still wishes to be divorced from her.  The mother in her oral evidence told me that she had been informed by the father as long ago as 2001 that they were already divorced, and thus she felt able to marry her new husband, the civil ceremony celebrating that marriage taking place at the Harare Magistrates&#8217; Court on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2005,just before her flight.  In passages of her interview with the immigration service on arrival in England (see section E pages 7 &#8211; 27 inclusive) she states that she was married by traditional ceremony to her new husband on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2000 (in fact the date of her civil marriage to the father), and married under civil ceremony on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2005.  The same information appears in typed form signed on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2005 by the mother at E 35.  In her oral evidence she simply attempted to assert that this was an innocent mistake.  I do not believe her.  She was lying to me when she told me the father had told her she was divorced, and she lied to the immigration services about the traditional ceremony in October 2000 to her new &#8220;husband&#8221;.  It was, in my judgment, a clear attempt to persuade the immigration authorities that she had been married both by custom, and later by law, for a number of years before arrival here in order to bolster her position.  She is of course not lawfully married to him, and I have no faith that she ever underwent a customary marriage to him earlier on.</p>

They were of course not his children, nor does the evidence establish that they lived together for long or at all, and I find this is a further illustration of an attempt to mislead the authorities by attempting to establish a strong family unit which had to be kept together, a position which might well be significantly undermined if she had owned up to a marriage occurring only three days before she left Africa.  This impression is strongly reinforced by paragraph 16 of the same document (E 30) where she speaks of M being followed by men between her school and home who asked M &#8220;when was the last time her father went to South Africa and they would ask my daughters friends where M&#8217;s father was&#8221; (sic).  This is a clear reference not to the father but to her new husband as is clear from the wider context of the document where she is seeking to make a case that both her husband, and necessarily by association with him, she and the children would be at risk if returned to Zimbabwe.</p>

The further aspect of her account which fits with the surreptitious nature of their departure without the consent of the father is the obtaining of passport photographs of the children in December 2004, as part of her scheme to remove the children from Zimbabwe.  She would not have needed such photographs at that time for she gives no account of losing either her own or the children&#8217;s passports until 2005, and indeed never had them in her possession to lose as I have earlier found.</p>

I have no doubt at all that this mother was planning to remove the children without the father&#8217;s consent many months before she did so, for she knew that she would never obtain such consent.

He had been extending the contact by a few days at a time at her request, but when he became anxious and started making enquiries, he discovered that the maternal aunt with whom the mother had been staying with their children had moved home and left no forwarding address; and when he made further enquiries of the school, he discovered that the children had held a &#8220;farewell party&#8221; the previous Friday.  This is, to my mind, the sort of compelling detail that makes his account utterly credible.</p>

That computer crashed, and accordingly the majority of the e-mails on it are irrecoverable (the few survivors appearing in my bundle).

He is demonstrably extremely proud of them, and encouraging of them and their school work.  He says nothing in these e-mails about wanting the girls to come back to Harare, although he makes it abundantly clear that he misses them.  Mr. Nicholls QC in cross-examining the father attempted to suggest to him that if indeed he was intent on obtaining the return of the girls, he would have said as much directly and made specific reference to his wishes in that matter.  I listened to the father as he explained to me, without rancour, that he wished to say nothing to his daughters which would upset their equanimity, for these were not matters which he felt it suitable to discuss with them.  His exchanges on the subject on which he made his wishes abundantly clear were with the mother in his exchanges with her on her dedicated e-mail address.  By restricting exchanges of that nature to her account he ensured that his children would not be caught up in the conflict between the parents.  He was critical of the mother for not producing her copies of these exchanges.  I accept the father&#8217;s evidence on this matter, whilst of course noting that it was not in the mother&#8217;s interests to produce any documentation of the kind I accept he sent her requiring her to bring the girls home forthwith, for it would fatally undermine her bogus claim that he both consented and/or acquiesced.</p>

The first relevant message is to be found at C523 (14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2005 at 1:53 pm).  It reads: &#8220;Do not thank me for this because Mom reads my messages, our address is&#8221; and then she gives their address in the town of H.  At C 525 (22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October at 3:34pm) she says: &#8220;DEAR DAD, I HATE IT HERE.  I AM WRITING IN BIG LETTERS BECAUSE I AM ANGRY BECAUSE I GAVE YOU THE ADRESS FOR YOU TO COME AND TAKE ME AND T.  REPLY ME (sic) AS SOON AS YOU GET THIS MESSEGE&#8221;.

Two days later on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October at 1:53 pm there is a much longer message in lower case (the previous two having been in upper case).  It is full of optimism and how much the girls are enjoying themselves and how they would like him to come and visit.  It is full of suggestions of friends and entertainments etc. (C527).  Forty minutes later at 2:33 pm M writes in upper case: &#8220;IF YOU SEE ME CHANGING MY MIND, I AM NOT THE ONE WRITING THEM MASSEGE (sic) I AM IN A HURRY SO THAT MOM KENT (sic) FIND ME DOING THIS&#8221;.

The first is that the father submits that the message full of optimism at C 527 is not in fact from M but is from her mother.  It is clear from the evidence that the mother reads all of the e-mail traffic of her daughters, a perfectly proper thing for her to be doing given their ages.  But it is equally clear that had she found the messages suggesting that M &amp; T were unhappy living in England, she would have done her best to countermand this impression swiftly, as I find she did, for I prefer the father&#8217;s interpretation of this insertion into a series of disenchanted e-mails to have been made by the mother.  I do so even bearing in mind that children can change their minds very quickly depending on what is going on in their lives.

Mr. Scott-Manderson further points to the fact that the mother has been served with a Notice of Refusal, her appeal was out of time, and an application for judicial review is two years out of time.

He submits that, although Mr Nicholls in his closing submissions refers on a number of occasions to the &#8220;brutality&#8221; inflicted upon the mother by the forces of the State, this brutality (so Mr Scott-Manderson suggests) amounted to allegations that she had been slapped.   Thus, in Mr. Scott-Manderson&#8217;s submission, it is most unlikely that she could possibly make out, in her own case (let alone in relation to the children), that she would face from the forces of the State in Zimbabwe assault or mistreatment of any kind sufficient to qualify as a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950 as incorporated into domestic law.  Article 3 of that Convention is of course a consideration for the IND, for they must consider whether a deportee would face treatment such as to amount to a breach of their Article 3 rights in deciding whether to deport or not as earlier stated.</p>

(under appeal) makes it clear that &#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 15</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</ref> did not prevent a family judge from exercising his powers, whether under international Convention, statute or wardship, to return a child to the country of its habitual residence where that return was in the child&#8217;s best interests, whether or not the child was the dependent of any asylum applicant, as in this case, or had made an asylum application in his or her own right&#8221;.  I take it that the reference in that extract  to &#8220;that return was in the child&#8217;s best interests&#8221; was specifically in the context of the case Bennett J. was deciding, he considering the matter under the inherent jurisdiction, for the country to which he was returning the child was not a signatory to the Hague Convention.  Save for that cautionary note, reminding myself that the Hague Convention does not operate on the principle of the child&#8217;s best interests, but on its own wording imposing its own obligations on each contracting State.  I respectfully agree with Bennett J.&#8217;s approach.  </p>

Certainly on the face of it the husband was said to have breached state security by breaking some unspecified section of one of the security acts.  Since it was not the equivalent of an indictment there were no particulars upon the face of the document. In the course of the hearing an e-mail was produced dated the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2007 (09:48) to the father&#8217;s solicitor from the father.  He had made enquiries through his office as to the warrant of arrest and its validity.  The answer reads:  &#8220;Have checked with the clerk of court at Rotten Raw (sic) and he confirmed the document as a true record, there was a trial and a verdict passed, that&#8217;s all he could say&#8221;.  Once again father is producing material which is on its face not in his interests to produce, for he was concerned as to validity of the warrant although, it being a copy, he declined in oral evidence to assert that it was a forgery, simply raising the question in a proper fashion.  He now, through his own office in Zimbabwe, produces evidence to show that there was indeed a trial of the mother&#8217;s husband.  He does not know whether it led to an acquittal or a conviction, thus I must take seriously the risk that it was a conviction with the obvious consequences or potential consequences for the mother&#8217;s husband should he return to Zimbabwe.</p>

As part of the landscape I consider it would be unwise of me to rule out as a real possibility that the husband will face arrest and possible imprisonment should he return.

They are not, essentially, interested in her.  As to the risk of prosecution of her as a failed asylum seeker, the father told me, and I accept, that he has never heard of any such prosecutions, and that it is most unlikely that she would face such a procedure.  I accept his evidence, whilst of course bearing in mind the submission made by Mr. Nicholls recorded elsewhere that there is or may be a real risk of such an outcome (see that part of this judgment which discusses the cessation of forced deportations to Zimbabwe, and the case of AA v Secretary of State for the Home Department <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2007/149" uk:canonical="[2007] EWCA Civ 149" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWCA Civ. 149</ref> (see above).</p>

I do not accept her evidence on this subject, and in rejecting it simply advert to the fact that she has, at times, been sufficiently trusting of it to seek domestic orders relating to the custody and welfare of her children in the past.</p>

I remind myself (not in a spirit of mischief, nor indeed casually) that it was this mother who absented herself voluntarily from the lives of her two children for a period of some two and a half years without thought as to the psychological consequences to them of so doing.  However that previous absence should not be taken by me as either a benchmark of her attitude towards her children, nor as an indicator that these children in their current state could sustain a further separation from her, for they are now older and their circumstances quite different from those which pertained between 2002 and 2004.</p>

Even after the close of the evidence, and indeed the close of written submissions, I was provided (with the consent of the father&#8217;s leading counsel) with an extract from Hansard recording a debate in the House of Commons on the subject of Zimbabwe which had taken place on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2007.

It contains, as Mr. Nicholls points out, comments by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development.  Those comments are highly critical of the general conditions operating within Zimbabwe, and of the administration of Mr. Robert Mugabe in particular.

I consider there to be a significant difference between positive coaching, and general commentary and attitude towards Zimbabwe over a long period in the household which they occupy.  I too could not, on this evidence, make any finding that either child had been specifically coached for this interview, and the subsequent telephone call referred to in the second of the CAFCASS reports.  </p>

I have also considered the children&#8217;s objections.  Ultimately, there is nothing exceptional about this case on any view.

I do not find it to be essential that he should do so.  I was impressed by his measured evidence, by his acceptance that there are, for some members of the population in Zimbabwe, shortages and difficulties (further admissions against his own interest).  I was further impressed, and accept his evidence also upon the following:  his own financial affairs are in a sufficiently healthy state for him to comply with these undertakings; as for the provision of petrol, his evidence was careful and detailed when he told me that his transport business has contractual arrangements with B.P. for direct supply to his company from their depot in South Africa, thus avoiding the shortages which fall upon other citizens.  I further accept that he has a smallholding, the arable sector of which provides green-grocery provisions to international supermarkets, some of which could be diverted by way of provision of basic staple foods to his family, and cattle which, when slaughtered, can provide basic animal products.</p>

I do so, for I consider that should the mother return with the children she will need a little time to stabilise her affairs and seek legal advice, and take such action as may prove necessary to engage in the litigation process, if that proves necessary, in Zimbabwe.  I have thus extended the period to three months.  Some of the undertakings as specified in the pre-amble to them are not intended to be time-limited, and in respect of those so nominated, I accept them without limitation of time, and subject only to any further application if ever made in the English courts to vary or discharge them.</p>

In the event that the mother chooses to return to Zimbabwe with the children, and wishes to give these undertakings to this court, then she may execute the appropriate written form of undertaking, and a short directions hearing can be taken in front of the Urgent Applications Judge in the event of my absence from London so that she can give those undertakings formally.</p>
