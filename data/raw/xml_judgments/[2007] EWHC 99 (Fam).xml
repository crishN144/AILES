In circumstances to which I shall have to return in due course, the proceedings have become needlessly complicated and, as a result, quite inordinately protracted.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband and the wife (as I shall for convenience refer to them) were born in 1942 and 1948 respectively. Their relationship began in 1982. They married on 26 October 1984. The marriage seems to have come under significant strain in 1997. They separated in 2001, though for a time continuing to live under the same roof. The wife petitioned for divorce on 22 May 2001. The decree nisi followed on 23 August 2001. The wife served her Form A on 10 July 2003. There was more than the usual amount of interlocutory skirmishing. On 18 November 2003 Pauffley J granted the wife a freezing order against the husband, continued by an order made by Bennett J on 25 November 2003. On 18 February 2005 Singer J adjourned the final hearing, which had been fixed for 28 February 2005, to 12 December 2005. The final hearing did indeed start before me on that day but, for reasons explained below, did not conclude until 10 November 2006. I now (29 January 2007) hand down judgment.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I must add a little detail about the trusts. Each of the trusts was created by a deed dated 9 November 1984 &#8211; that is, it will be noted, <span style="font-style:italic">before </span>Mr Registrar Turner had given judgment in the ancillary relief proceedings arising out of the husband&#8217;s first marriage. Each of the trusts is governed by English law. One trust (which I shall refer to as the Parents&#8217; Discretionary Trust) was created by the husband&#8217;s parents and holds 1,700 of the shares in HDC (34%). The other trust (which I shall refer to as Anthony&#8217;s Discretionary Trust) was created by the husband&#8217;s unmarried brother, Anthony, and holds the remaining 1,000 shares (20%). Subject to the fact that, in the usual way, Anthony, as settlor, is excluded from benefit under Anthony&#8217;s Discretionary Trust, the beneficiaries under both trusts are the children and remoter issue of the husband&#8217;s parents then living or born at any time before 9 November 2064. The beneficiaries thus include Anthony, the husband, his children (Simon and Zara) and their children and grandchildren. It is important to note, therefore, that the beneficiaries are not a closed class all of whom are ascertained and sui juris. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Initially the trustees of the Parents&#8217; Discretionary Trust were two professionally qualified English accountants, Mr Halton and Mr Luder. The trustees of Anthony&#8217;s Discretionary Trust were a Mr Pickard and a Mr Jolly. In October 1989 all four trustees retired and were replaced, as trustees of both trusts, by the husband and the wife. In 1991 the husband and the wife retired as trustees and were replaced by a trust company, Credit Suisse Trustees (Guernsey) Limited (&#8220;CSTGL&#8221;) which, as its name would suggest, was based in Guernsey. In 1996 CSTGL was replaced as trustee by the interveners, who are based in Jersey. The first intervener is a trust company used as a vehicle for such purposes by the second and third interveners who are also trustees, along with the first intervener, of both trusts. The second intervener (Mr St George) and the third intervener are both professionally qualified accountants. It is to be noted that although the current trustees are based in Jersey, and are therefore personally responsible to the Jersey regulatory authorities, the trusts continue to be governed by English law and not by Jersey law.</p>

It has been made much more complex because of the wife&#8217;s allegations (i) that the trusts are shams &#8211; with the consequence, so the wife would say, that the husband is to be treated as owning not 1,150 (23%) of the shares in HDC but 3,850 shares (77%), (ii) that the shares in HDC held by the trusts are in any event to be treated as available to the husband in accordance with the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas v Thomas </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 668" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 668</ref>, and (iii) that the value of HDC has been artificially reduced by the husband (a) skimming off substantial sums in cash and (b) diverting its business to FHP. To a much more limited extent the case has also been made more complex because of the husband&#8217;s allegation that the wife still has an interest in CWM.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Charles Howard QC, on behalf of the husband, was justifiably scathing about what he says was the muddled and confused way the allegation of sham was being put even as late as the first day of the final hearing. It would seem that the allegation finds its origin in findings made by Mr Registrar Turner in 1985. The allegation was made in terms, using the word &#8220;sham&#8221;, in an affidavit the wife swore on 18 November 2003. In the wife&#8217;s Form E (sworn on 10 September 2003), and in the very detailed Chronology prepared on her behalf by Mr Philip Moor QC and Mr Christopher Wood, it was said that the husband was &#8220;the de facto controller and beneficiary&#8221; of the trusts. It was further asserted in the Chronology that &#8220;the reason for placing the shares in trust was because [the husband] was in the process of divorcing from his first wife and wished to present himself as a minority shareholder in that dispute&#8221; and that &#8220;in practice&#8221; the husband &#8220;controlled those shares.&#8221; In the Case Summary they prepared for the final hearing, Mr Moor and Mr Wood asserted that the husband &#8220;set out to do everything in his power to defeat his first wife&#8217;s claims against him, including the creation of the off-shore trusts as an integral part of the campaign.&#8221; Mr Howard&#8217;s acerbic comment is that the husband did not create the trusts and that they were not initially off-shore. </p>

In deciding whether or not, and, if so, in what manner, these principles operate in any particular case, the court will of course have regard to the particular context and to the particular factual matrix. Thus it may be easier, for example, to &#8216;pierce the corporate veil&#8217; in the context of a small family company than in some larger-scale or more purely commercial context. Similarly, the inferences that can properly be drawn in the case of an asserted resulting trust may differ, even in a family context, depending upon the nature of the relationship between the parties; an inference appropriate in the case of a married couple may not be appropriate in the case of an unmarried couple, whilst an inference appropriate in the case of a couple (whether married or unmarried) may be wholly inappropriate as between siblings. </p>

There is not one law of &#8216;sham&#8217; in the Chancery Division and another law of &#8216;sham&#8217; in the Family Division. There is only one law of &#8216;sham&#8217;, to be applied equally in all three Divisions of the High Court, just as there is but one set of principles, again equally applicable in all three Divisions, determining whether or not it is appropriate to &#8216;pierce the corporate veil.&#8217;</p>

I am sympathetic to the approach being suggested by the Deputy Judge, though I would not wish to be quite so prescriptive as he appears to be.

For example, in the first and second types of case I mentioned, the court is merely concerned to ascertain the legal nature or effect of what is accepted to be entirely genuine. So also, in a case founded on <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> or analogous statutory provisions, the court is concerned with a document or transaction which is entirely genuine. After all, the purpose of the transferor is to do the very thing which the transaction purports to achieve, to divest himself of some asset and put it beyond the reach of his creditor or spouse (as the case may be). The presence of the statutorily defined vitiating feature merely entitles the court to set aside a transaction which is otherwise entirely genuine.</p>

In his written argument in this court, Mr Pointer QC, on behalf of the wife, at one point referred to the possible &#8216;unity of interest&#8217; between the husband and Codan; and in his written argument before the judge he tentatively described Codan as &#8216;quasi-agents&#8217; of the husband. Both phrases imply that Codan is not asserting, or would not assert, the independence that its duties require of it; and, in my view, on the present evidence, it was wise of Mr Pointer in oral argument to withdraw them. A trustee &#8211; in proper &#8216;control&#8217; of the trust &#8211; will usually be acting entirely properly if, after careful consideration of all relevant circumstances, he resolves in good faith to accede to a request by the settlor for the exercise of his power of advancement of capital, whether back to the settlor or to any other beneficiary.&#8221;</p>

It is not only squarely in line with the guidance given by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1967] 2 QB 786" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1967">[1967] 2 QB 786</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Hitch v Stone</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] STC 214" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] STC 214</ref>, it also appears to me to be correct in principle. When a settlor creates a settlement he purports to divest himself of assets in favour of the trustee, and the trustee accepts them on the basis of the trusts of the settlement. The settlor may have an unspoken intention that the assets are in fact to be treated as his own and that the trustee will accede to his every request on demand. But unless that intention is from the outset shared by the trustee (or later becomes so shared), I fail to see how the settlement can be regarded as a sham. Once the assets are vested in the trustee, they will be held on the declared trusts, and he is entitled to regard them as so held and to ignore any demands from the settlor as to how to deal with them. I cannot understand on what basis a third party could claim, merely by reference to the unilateral intentions of the settlor, that the settlement was a sham and that the assets in fact remained the settlor&#8217;s property. One might as well say that an apparently outright gift made by a donor can subsequently be held to be a sham on the basis of some unspoken intention by the donor not to part with the property in it. But if the donee accepted the gift on the footing that it was a genuine gift, the donor&#8217;s undeclared intentions cannot turn an ostensibly valid disposition of his property into no disposition at all. To set that sort of case up the donee must also be shown to be a party to the alleged sham. In my judgment, in the case of a settlement executed by a settlor and a trustee, it is insufficient in considering whether or not it is a sham to look merely at the intentions of the settlor. It is essential also to look at those of the trustee.&#8221;</p>

The question therefore arises as to which of the trustees&#8217; intentions are relevant for this purpose. Put somewhat differently, the question arises as to whether a trust which is not a sham can subsequently become a sham and, conversely, whether a trust which is a sham can subsequently lose that character. I need to take some time to analyse this issue because, as we shall see in due course, it is in fact, in my judgment, determinative in the final analysis of the wife&#8217;s claim insofar as it is based on sham.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems to me that as a matter of principle a trust which is not initially a sham cannot subsequently become a sham. The reason is that elaborated by Rimer J in the passage in <span style="font-style:italic">Shalson and others v Russo and others (Mimran and another, Part 20 claimants) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2003/1637" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 1637 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 1637 (Ch)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] Ch 281" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] Ch 281</ref>, at para [190] which I have just set out. Once a trust has been properly constituted, typically by the vesting of the trust property in the trustee(s) and by the execution of the deed setting out the trusts upon which the trust property is to be held by the trustee(s), the property cannot lose its character as trust property save in accordance with the terms of the trust itself, for example, by being paid to or applied for the benefit of a beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the trust deed. Any other application of the trust property is simply and necessarily a breach of trust; nothing less and nothing more. </p>

If therefore, a trustee who has entered into his responsibilities, and without having any intention of being party to a sham, subsequently purports, perhaps in agreement with the settlor, to treat the trust as a sham, the effect is not to create a sham where previously there was a valid trust. The only effect, even if the agreement is actually carried into execution, is to expose the trustee to a claim for breach of trust and, it may well be, to expose the settlor to a claim for knowing assistance in that breach of trust. Nor can it make any difference, where the trust has already been properly constituted, that a trustee may have entered into office &#8211; may indeed have been appointed a trustee in place of an honest trustee &#8211; for the very purpose and with the intention of treating the trust for the future as a sham. If, having been appointed trustee, he has the trust property under his control, he cannot be heard to dispute either the fact that it is trust property or the existence of his own fiduciary duty.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to consider the converse case. Can a trust which is initially a sham subsequently lose that character? I see no reason in principle why that should not be possible. The situation is best explained by an example. S has purportedly vested property in T1 as trustee of a trust which is in fact, consistently with their common intention, a sham from the outset. T1 now wishes to retire as &#8220;trustee.&#8221; S, executing all the appropriate documents, purports to appoint T2 as T1&#8217;s successor and to transfer the &#8220;trust property&#8221; into T2&#8217;s name. Now if T2 knows that the &#8220;trust&#8221; is a sham and accepts appointment as &#8220;trustee&#8221; intending to perpetuate the sham, then nothing has changed. The &#8220;trust&#8221; was a sham whilst T1 was the &#8220;trustee&#8221; and remains a sham even though T1 has been replaced by T2. But what if T2 does not know that the &#8220;trust&#8221; was a sham, and accepts appointment believing the &#8220;trust&#8221; to be entirely genuine and intending to perform his fiduciary duties conscientiously and strictly in accordance with what he believes to be a genuine trust deed? I cannot see any reason why, in that situation, what was previously a sham should not become, even if only for the future, a genuine trust. </p>

After all, in the circumstances I have postulated, the trust property has been vested in someone who accepts that he holds the property as trustee on the trusts of a document which he believes to be a genuine instrument. He has no intention that the arrangement should be a sham. Conceptually, as it seems to me, the situation is, in reality, no different from that which was considered by Rimer J in the passage in <span style="font-style:italic">Shalson and others v Russo and others (Mimran and another, Part 20 claimants) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2003/1637" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 1637 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 1637 (Ch)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] Ch 281" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] Ch 281</ref>, at para [190] that I have already quoted.</p>

It took effect by way of a resettlement by Cantrust of assets held by it under the prior trusts. In creating the new settlement, Cantrust was exercising powers it regarded itself as having under those trusts, and no pleaded challenge is raised either to the validity of those trusts (it is not suggested they were shams) or to the exercise of the power to resettle their assets. Given those circumstances &#8230; I am unable to accept the proposition that the settlement created in March 1999 was a sham. If the only person executing the document which created the settlement intended it to be a genuine settlement &#8211; as Cantrust did &#8211; the acts or intentions of others cannot have made it a sham &#8230; [W]hatever may have been the private intentions of the Russo family, if Cantrust intended the settlement to be a genuine one the settlement must have resulted in the resettled assets becoming held on the trusts that Cantrust regarded itself as creating and which, on the face of it, it did create.&#8221;</p>

That is a classic case of sham. The declaration of trust in favour of B is meaningless and has no legal effect whatsoever.

In this situation, Mr Wagstaffe suggests, the transaction is not wholly devoid of legal effect. The declaration of trust setting out the ostensible terms may not be of any effect, but that does not mean, he says, that there is no enforceable arrangement between the parties at all. He suggests that in this situation the court has to determine, on the evidence, what the real terms of the transaction are and then, as I understand his argument, to give effect to it. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before parting with the law, there is one final point to be made. I do not see how, considering the nature of a sham, a transaction can be a sham for one purpose but not for another. A transaction is either genuine or it is a sham. If it is genuine, then in principle the function of the court is simply to ascertain its legal nature and effect and enforce it accordingly. If it is a sham, then it is in principle ineffective, indeed void, according to Arden LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Hitch v Stone</span>. There is, in my judgment, no possible middle course, no third alternative. So, for example, a transaction cannot be genuine as between a husband and the Revenue whilst being at the same a sham as between him and his wife. The point is analogous to that which arises when a husband puts the matrimonial home in the name of his wife to protect it from his creditors in the event of him becoming bankrupt. The point was put with characteristic clarity by Lord Denning MR in <span style="font-style:italic">Tinker v Tinker </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1970] P 136" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1970">[1970] P 136</ref> at page 141:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Mr Wagstaffe correctly points out, it is beyond contestation that prior to 1984 the owners of the 54% interest in HDC which is now in issue were the husband&#8217;s father (as to 34%) and his brother Anthony (as to 20%). It follows logically that the wife&#8217;s entire case rests on the proposition that the settlors (the father and Anthony) intended to divest themselves of those shares. As Mr Wagstaffe observes, there could be no benefit to the wife in a finding that Anthony and/or the father&#8217;s estate in fact remain the true owners of the shares. So the wife&#8217;s case inevitably involves the proposition that the settlors intended the original trustees to hold the shares for the benefit of a person or persons other than the settlors. Since, as a matter of fact, the shares were transferred by the settlors to the original trustees, and are now held by the interveners, the current trustees, the only issue is whether the shares are held by them on the declared trusts (as the husband and the interested parties assert) or whether they are in reality held by the trustees on some other basis &#8211; that is, as the wife has to assert (though this is not in fact how she puts her case), on a bare trust for the husband, and not as discretionary trustees for a wider class of beneficiaries.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems to me that Mr Wagstaffe&#8217;s analysis is plainly correct.

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In the first place, as Mr Wagstaffe observes, it is a complete non-sequitur to suggest that if the terms of a settlement made by A for the benefit of B are in reality other than those which appear on the face of the relevant instrument, the necessary consequence is that C is the beneficial owner of the property. As Mr Wagstaffe comments, Mr Moor presents the proposition that the shares were gifted to the husband in 1984 as following, as night follows day, a conclusion that the 1984 transactions were shams. He submits, and I agree, that the consequence simply does not flow from a finding of sham.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Secondly, and in any event, as Mr Wagstaffe submits, it is impossible to see how it can be said that the shares were gifted to the husband in 1984 when he never became the owner of the shares (save as a trustee much later). As Mr Wagstaffe comments, a gift involves a transfer of property with an intention on the part of the donor that the donee shall become the beneficial owner. If the shares were never transferred to the husband, how (he asks rhetorically) can it be said that they have been given to him?</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with Mr Wagstaffe that the wife&#8217;s case of sham, if it is to &#8216;work&#8217; at all, has to amount to this: that the intention of the husband&#8217;s father and brother and of all the original trustees (Mr Halton and Mr Luder, Mr Pickard and Mr Jolly) was that the shares were to be held by the trustees on trust for the husband. As to this, Mr Wagstaffe submits that such an intention cannot simply be assumed in such a cavalier fashion and that there is no evidence at all to support it. I shall return to the latter point below.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other fundamental legal flaw relates to Mr Moor&#8217;s submission that a transaction which was a sham at its inception cannot subsequently become effective, with the consequence that the sole issue in the present case is whether the trusts were a sham at their inception in 1984, so that it is not necessary for the wife to prove that the interveners are privy or party to any sham. I agree with Mr Wagstaffe, for the reasons I have already set out (see paragraphs [41]-[49] above), that this is simply not the law.</p>

Indeed, he says, and again I agree, in accordance with <span style="font-style:italic">National Westminster Bank plc v Jones </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 BCLC 98" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 BCLC 98</ref> that is what is to be presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary. So, submits Mr Wagstaffe, and I agree, whatever did or did not happen in 1984, the wife&#8217;s case on sham cannot succeed unless she can establish that the interveners, the current trustees, are privy or party to the sham, in the sense that they accepted office as trustees intending not to act in accordance with the trust deeds but instead simply to hold the shares to the husband&#8217;s order. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Wagstaffe doubts, as indeed I doubt, whether Mr Moor was actually prepared to go that far. Indeed, as Mr Wagstaffe points out, the allegation was never put to Mr St George in cross-examination by Mr Moor. (And when it was put to him by Mr Howard, albeit in &#8216;friendly&#8217; cross-examination, he rejected the suggestion and was not challenged on that evidence by Mr Moor.) Be all that as it may, Mr Wagstaffe&#8217;s primary submission is that there is simply no evidence which would begin to justify such an accusation. On the contrary, he submits, the documentary evidence demonstrates that the trustees have acted properly and independently wherever circumstances required them to act at all.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before addressing Mr Moor&#8217;s submissions in detail there are a couple of preliminary points to be made. The first reflects a submission made by Mr Howard in relation to the setting up of the trusts in 1984. There are two aspects to this:</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In the first place, as Mr Howard pointedly observes, there is nothing illegitimate or sham-like about a settlor who creates a trust because he does not want his soon-to-be former daughter-in-law to be able to claim his assets which he is contemplating transferring to his son, her husband. It is not, as he says, a sham for a settlor, even if he is the husband, to put assets into a trust to distance himself from them in divorce proceedings. The trust itself would be perfectly legitimate albeit, if the husband was the settlor, susceptible to challenge under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other preliminary point reflects a submission made by Mr Wagstaffe. As he correctly observed, the mere fact that a trustee complies with a request from the settlor (or, for that matter, a request from a beneficiary) to exercise his discretion in a particular way provides no basis at all for the suggestion that the trust is a sham. As Wilson LJ observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Charman v Charman </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2005/1606" uk:canonical="[2005] EWCA Civ 1606" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWCA Civ 1606</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 FLR 422" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 FLR 422</ref>, at para [12]:</p>

	      <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">In other words, the mere fact that a trustee happens to agree with a settlor or beneficiary that a particular course of action is appropriate (whether, for example, making a loan available to a subsidiary company, advancing capital to a particular person or, as in this case, waiving a dividend) cannot without more justify the conclusion that the trustee has not exercised his independent discretion. On the contrary, submits Mr Wagstaffe, the wife&#8217;s case here depends in large measure upon conduct on the part of the trustees which is, at least on the face of it, to use Wilson LJ&#8217;s words, &#8220;entirely proper&#8221;.</p>

Indeed, he is able to point to the fact that on at least one occasion (in 2004) the trustees took independent legal advice. There is, he submits, absolutely no direct evidence that the trustees have ever acted otherwise than independently, and Mr St George, in both his written and his oral evidence, specifically rejected the allegation. At least as against the current trustees &#8211; the interveners &#8211; the wife&#8217;s case depends in truth, he submits, upon the inferences which she invites me to draw, inferences which, he says, I cannot possibly draw given that there is, as he would have it, a reasonable and innocent explanation for everything the trustees have done or (as the case may be) not done.</p>

And the same goes, he says, and I agree, for the letter to the Inland Revenue dated 7 May 1997 similarly relied upon by Mr Moor. Moreover, as Mr Howard points out, the allegation that the trustees looked solely to the husband and used him as their channel of communication with Anthony is not entirely accurate: Anthony visited Guernsey to meet CSTGL and Simon travelled to Jersey to see Mr St George; and the letter from CSTGL dated 18 February 1994 was in fact written to Anthony.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus, as Mr Wagstaffe correctly submits, the trustees&#8217; decision to waive the dividend was plainly one which the trustees were entitled to take having regard to the overall best interests of the beneficiaries: had they refused to waive the dividend, significant tax liabilities would have been created to the detriment of the HDC shares (shares in HDC being of course the only asset held by the trusts); moreover Mr St George&#8217;s unchallenged evidence was that dividend monies would in any event probably have been invested in one form or another and probably not been distributed to the beneficiaries. The trustees&#8217; decision, he says, plainly fell well within the ambit of the discretion they were entitled to exercise. This example, latched upon by the wife as an instance of the trustees being under the husband&#8217;s control, provides, he submits, no support whatsoever for the suggestion that the trustees are simply the husband&#8217;s &#8216;yes-men.&#8217; On the contrary, as both Mr Howard and Mr Wagstaffe point out, the proposal was put to the trustees and considered by them on the merits &#8211; and their agreement to what was proposed was not an automatic assent; Mr St George required to be persuaded that what was being proposed was indeed in the overall interests of the beneficiaries.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the various schemes of corporate re-organisation, as Mr Wagstaffe correctly points out, the trust funds were not going to be diluted. As Mr Howard put it, all these schemes preserved the integrity of the trusts and the independence of the trustees. The trustees stood to acquire either loan notes or shares in another company in place of their holding of shares in HDC, but there is absolutely nothing to suggest that the overall value of their investment &#8211; the value of the trust funds &#8211; would not remain exactly the same. As Mr Wagstaffe put it, in circumstances where there was no particular disadvantage to the trusts, and a possible advantage to HDC, it is easy to see why the trustees were happy to agree in principle to the proposed schemes. Again, he submits, this provides no basis for the suggestion that the trusts are shams. Quite the contrary. Mr Howard points to a letter dated 28 June 1999 written to Mr St George by a Mr Jeffery (who was advising the husband at that time) in relation to the proposed acquisition of the shares by WGL &#8220;if the proposal is acceptable to you as trustees.&#8221; The letter, which was copied to the husband, expressed Mr Jeffery&#8217;s view that &#8220;the reconstruction will be in the best interests of [HDC] and of its shareholders (including yourselves as trustees)&#8221; and continued, &#8220;I would therefore recommend that you take up the shares in [WGL]&#8221;.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the complaint that the trustees did not involve themselves in the day-to-day running of HDC, Mr Wagstaffe points out, correctly, that as a matter of general principle, companies are run by their directors, not their shareholders, that the trustees are, moreover, entitled under the terms of the trust deeds to leave the day-to-day running of the company to HDC&#8217;s management &#8211; in other words to the husband who was, and more recently to Simon who is, the managing director &#8211; and that the trustees&#8217; decision in this respect is in no way unusual. Moreover, as he also points out, the decision of the trustees has been vindicated by the fact that during the time the current trustees have been in office the value of HDC (whichever expert&#8217;s view on that matter is accepted) has plainly increased in very significant measure. Again, therefore, Mr Wagstaffe submits, this suggestion provides no basis at all for drawing the inference that the trusts are shams.</p>

What is quite clear, he says, is that there is no evidence to justify a finding that the current trustees are parties to a sham; and without such a finding, he submits, the wife&#8217;s case on sham cannot, as a matter of law, possibly succeed. </p>

On the contrary, he says, a letter dated 3 August 1987 written by Mr Luder to the husband and copied to Mr Halton, shows Mr Luder quite clearly regarding the trust of which he was a trustee as being genuine and not a sham: the letter, for instance, refers to the shares &#8220;presently held in trust&#8221; and distinguishes them from &#8220;your own shares&#8221; and also canvasses the possibility of the husband&#8217;s &#8220;renunciation of your interest under the two Settlements.&#8221; And if Mr Luder and Mr Halton were not involved in a sham then it is, he says, fanciful to suggest that Mr Pickard and Mr Jolly, the trustees of a trust set up at the very same time, were involved in a sham. </p>

No evidence from the original trustees as to what they intended has been adduced. The husband&#8217;s father is dead. Anthony&#8217;s evidence, so Mr Howard and Mr Wagstaffe would have me accept, and I agree, does not support the contention that his intention in 1984 was to gift his shares to his brother. Moreover, as Mr Howard correctly points out it was never suggested to Anthony by Mr Moor that he had been dishonest or party to a sham; when questioned by Mr Howard he affirmed that the trusts were genuine. </p>

As Mr Wagstaffe pithily observes, if A gives property to B, the legality of the transaction cannot be affected by C&#8217;s motives. The husband was neither a settlor nor a trustee, so he was not, in this sense, one of the parties to the transaction. Mr Wagstaffe submits that the evidence simply does not begin to establish what the wife has to prove if this part of her case is to succeed. I agree.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reality, says Mr Howard, is that in the final analysis the wife&#8217;s entire case that the trusts were shams from their inception in 1984 rests on nothing more than her own evidence that the husband&#8217;s father had told her that he would make a gift of the shares to his son. Let it be assumed that the wife&#8217;s evidence on this point is reliable (something Mr Howard does not accept). Let it be assumed, moreover, that what the husband&#8217;s father said to the wife actually reflected his true plans and intentions (something which, again, Mr Howard does not accept &#8211; her father-in-law may have been fobbing her off or he may have subsequently changed his mind). None of this, says Mr Howard, gets the wife anywhere. Whatever the husband&#8217;s father may have said to the wife, it is a wholly inadequate foundation on which to make a finding of sham against Mr Luder and Mr Halton. Moreover, it is not pertinent to anything done by Anthony or by Mr Pickard and Mr Jolly in relation to the other trust.</p>

Mr Howard also points to the letter from CSTGL dated 18 February 1994 relied on by Mr Moor as in fact demonstrating quite the reverse of what Mr Moor would have me accept. That letter, says Mr Howard, quite clearly shows that CSTGL was not treating the trusts as shams. Moreover, as Mr Howard observes, what CSTGL was actually proposing was a transfer of all the shares out of the trusts not to the husband but to Simon and Zara &#8211; something wholly inconsistent with the wife&#8217;s case that there was a gift to the husband in 1984 and with her case that, the trusts being, as she alleges, shams, the shares belong and have always belonged to the husband, as indeed with her case that the shares were intended to be transferred back to him as soon as his divorce from his first wife had been finalised. In relation to the same period, Mr Howard can also point to a letter written by the husband on 23 June 1993 which, he asserts, and I agree, shows the husband himself treating the trusts as entirely valid.</p>

At that point the wife and her advisers were faced with a simple if stark choice: they could either accept Mr St George&#8217;s evidence &#8211; which would have been the end of their case &#8211; or they could, if they thought they had the material to justify such an attack, have mounted a frontal attack on Mr St George&#8217;s credibility and professional integrity. Understandably, Mr Moor shrank from the latter course. But a case which, as I have said, should probably never have been brought, was allowed to continue, limping on to inevitable defeat and, in the process, significantly increasing both the length and the cost of the proceedings.</p>

The availability of unidentified resources may, for example, be inferred from a spouse&#8217;s expenditure or style of living, or from his inability or unwillingness to allow the complexity of his affairs to be penetrated with the precision necessary to ascertain his actual wealth or the degree of liquidity of his assets. Another is that where a spouse enjoys access to wealth but no absolute entitlement to it (as in the case, for example, of a beneficiary under a discretionary trust or someone who is dependent on the generosity of a relative), the court will not act in direct invasion of the rights of, or usurp the discretion exercisable by, a third party. Nor will it put upon a third party undue pressure to act in a way which will enhance the means of the maintaining spouse. This does not, however, mean that the court acts in total disregard of the potential availability of wealth from sources owned or administered by others. There will be occasions when it becomes permissible for a judge deliberately to frame his orders in a form which affords judicious encouragement to third parties to provide the maintaining spouse with the means to comply with the court&#8217;s view of the justice of the case. There are bound to be instances where the boundary between improper pressure and judicious encouragement proves to be a fine one, and it will require attention to the particular circumstances of each case to see whether it has been crossed.&#8221;</p>

But what does the word &#8216;resource&#8217; mean in this context? In my view, when properly focused, that central question is simply whether, if the husband were to request it to advance the whole (or part) of the capital of the trust to him, the trustee would be likely to do so. In other cases the question has been formulated in terms of whether the spouse has real or effective control over the trust. At times I have myself formulated it in that way. But, unless the situation is one in which there is ground for doubting whether the trustee is properly discharging its duties or would be likely to do so, it seems to me on reflection that such a formulation is not entirely apposite &#8230; </p>

The qualification relates to the word &#8216;immediate&#8217;. In that case the trial judge knew that, if he were to proceed also to order the wife to pay the husband&#8217;s costs, she would be unable to comply with his orders for her swift payment of a lump sum and costs without recourse to the off-shore trusts over which he found her to have &#8216;effective control&#8217;: see 295B&#8211;C. So the question in that case was whether her access to their funds was immediate.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the first place, although the court can &#8220;encourage&#8221; it cannot compel. As Mr Wagstaffe put it, and I agree, although the court can encourage a third party to transfer an asset to a party to the marriage, if that third party disregards the court&#8217;s encouragement, the court has no power under <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas v Thomas</span> to compel the transfer, for only property owned by a party to the marriage can be the subject of a property adjustment or other order under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>. Thus, to take a specific example, there is no power in the court, says Mr Wagstaffe, to order the transfer to the wife of the Antigua property, which is owned by HDC. That said, the trustees would have no particular objection to the Antigua property being transferred to the wife so long as (i) such a transfer did not put HDC in difficulties &#8211; he did not suggest that it would &#8211; and, more importantly, (ii) HDC received full consideration for the transfer (possibly by way of part-exchange for the wife&#8217;s shares in HDC). Likewise, says Mr Wagstaffe, in relation to HDC&#8217;s 75% share in the proceeds of sale of Drum Grange. Mr Wagstaffe, in my judgment, is plainly correct on all this.</p>

If money is to be extracted from HDC for the wife it should be done by HDC acquiring the wife&#8217;s shares. Anything else, he submits, will jeopardise the trusts one way or another. As he says, it cannot be in the interests of the trusts or the other beneficiaries for the trustees either to concede their majority control of HDC or to jeopardise HDC&#8217;s liquidity at what he asserts is this critical stage in its trading history.</p>

The court should not assume that the Trustees will automatically or inevitably exercise their discretion in any particular way simply because they are encouraged to do so by the court. By making this submission the Trustees are not indicating an intention to set their face against whatever the court may consider is the right solution as between [the husband and the wife]: they simply make it clear that they have a number of beneficiaries to consider and they will do what they think is right for the class of beneficiaries as a whole.

That would come dangerously close to placing a fetter on their own discretion which of course would be inconsistent with their duties as trustees. However the court should be reminded that the financial health of HDC is of paramount importance for the Trustees. The Trustees would be obliged to refuse any such request from [the husband] if the effect of exercising their discretion in [his] favour would be particularly onerous for the company and, indirectly, thereby for the beneficiaries.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">In this respect the role which Simon &#8230; plays within HDC is plainly of considerable importance. When, by way of illustration, the forensic accountants Mr Walton and Miss Walker gave evidence, they were both of the view that replacing Simon &#8230; within HDC would cost the company something in the order of &#163;100,000. Were [the husband] to make a request to the Trustees that they exercise their discretion in such a way as to enable [him] to live more comfortably with the consequences of such an order, the Trustees would inevitably have to give careful consideration to the possible repercussions for HDC itself and for the other beneficiaries. The position of Simon &#8230; would be of particular concern in view of his status as an important &#8216;player&#8217; within HDC, a shareholder in HDC, the father of two minor beneficiaries under the 1984 settlements and a beneficiary in his own right under those settlements. The Trustees would require considerable persuasion before they complied for instance with a request which had the effect of significantly undermining his ([Simon]&#8217;s) position and it is entirely possible that they would refuse point blank a request from [the husband] that had such an effect. The Trustees therefore urge caution when the court is invited by [the wife] to conclude that the Trustees would inevitably advance capital or appoint shares to [the husband] were he to request it to do so.&#8221;</p>

In other words, the trustees are likely to be prepared to facilitate, by waiving their dividends, distributions by HDC which are sensibly required either for the purpose of discharging (in whole or in part) the directors&#8217; loan accounts or for facilitating compliance with whatever order I may make against the husband. On the other hand, I do not think it likely that the trustees will be prepared to make capital distributions from the trusts for the benefit of the husband or in order to enable him to meet his obligations under any order I may make. It is, of course, possible that the trustees will be prepared to assist the husband in this way, but there is nothing in the history of the trusts thus far to suggest that they will and all the reasons marshalled by Mr Howard to suggest that they will not. For me to suggest that they should would, in my judgment, pass beyond &#8220;judicious encouragement&#8221; to improper pressure. I decline to do so.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Under the pressure of adversarial proceedings carried on with no little vigour on both sides, each party&#8217;s allegations against the other have intensified. Both protagonists accuse the other of giving less than frank evidence &#8211; that is to put it politely &#8211; and, more generally, of various forms of litigation misconduct. Thus Mr Howard accuses the wife of being less than frank in the evidence she put before the court in support of interlocutory applications. He also accuses her of prevarication and worse in her oral evidence before me. Mr Moor for his part makes similar allegations against the husband and points, with justification, to the great difficulties the wife has had throughout much of the litigation in making the husband comply with his obligations of full and frank disclosure.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not propose to rehearse in detail all the allegations and counter-allegations. What is clear is that both the husband and the wife have, at various stages in the litigation, been less &#8211; much less &#8211; than frank with each other and with the court. And there has been, in different ways and to different degrees, a certain amount of litigation misconduct on both sides. It follows that I must approach the evidence of both the wife and the husband with an appropriate degree of caution. That said, one must keep a sense of proportion. I do not think that either the husband or the wife has set out systematically to deceive the court. And the litigation misconduct is far indeed from the top end of the scale. Certainly there is nothing in any of this to justify any adjustment of the award that would otherwise be appropriate: cf, <span style="font-style:italic">Tavoulareas v Tavoulareas</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 2 FLR 418" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 2 FLR 418</ref> at page 426.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is common ground that, certainly in the past, HDC did much cash trading; a number of both casual and regular customers paid in cash. It is also clear that both the husband and the wife often used cash in their daily lives, and often in large amounts, when others might have paid by cheque or credit card. There is, of course, nothing unlawful or even suspicious about any of that. The question is whether the company&#8217;s cash was being skimmed off without going through the books and, by implication, without being declared to the Inland Revenue (now the Revenue and Customs). The wife says that cash &#8211; and in very substantial amounts &#8211; was being skimmed off in this way. The husband denies it.</p>

The question is whether the cash, to the extent that HDC dealt in cash, was properly recorded in the company&#8217;s books and accounts, as the husband asserts, or whether, as the wife claims, it was diverted &#8211; skimmed off &#8211; by the husband.</p>

Her belief may be genuine &#8211; I am prepared to accept that it is &#8211; but for evidence the wife has to look elsewhere. As Mr Moor very fairly accepted, she is not able to make good her case from her own first-hand knowledge. She is able, I accept, to point to various matters which, at least to a suspicious mind, might be thought consistent with diversion of cash, but none of them is conclusive; each is equally consistent with the husband&#8217;s case.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, the wife relies upon various documents she found &#8211; cash summaries and annotated cash envelopes and the like &#8211; which, she says, actually show the process by which HDC&#8217;s cash receipts were diverted by the husband into his own pocket. The husband vehemently denied the allegation, describing how HDC&#8217;s cash takings were taken home by him, carefully counted and recorded by him and then paid into HDC&#8217;s bank account. In relation to this part of the case he was in fact able to demonstrate, even though taken by surprise, that in many of the specific instances alleged by the wife the relevant cash had in fact been paid into HDC&#8217;s bank account. Between them the husband and Mr Howard were able to &#8216;marry up&#8217; many of the documents and the specific sums of money which the wife saw as incriminating and supportive of her case with the corresponding bank statements showing that the relevant cash takings had indeed been paid into HDC&#8217;s bank account. The husband was not able to carry out this exercise in relation to every transaction relied upon by the wife but this was hardly surprising given, first, the amount of time that had passed and the somewhat disorganised state of the relevant documentation and, secondly, the fact that, albeit unintentionally, as the wife would have it, the husband was in effect ambushed and had to respond, at least initially, at very short notice.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, the wife relies upon entries in some of HDC&#8217;s ledgers seemingly showing that at one time staff were paid, at least partly, in cash. To be precise, what the ledgers which the wife relies upon actually show is that some of the cash paid into HDC by its customers &#8211; and, I might note, recorded as such in its ledgers &#8211; was used to pay wages in cash. There is, of course, nothing unlawful in paying an employee in cash rather than by cheque or BACS payment, though the practice is much less common nowadays than once upon a time. The question is whether the relevant wages payments, and these cash payments in particular, were properly recorded in HDC&#8217;s books, so that, for example, proper deductions were made for PAYE and NI. The ledgers relied on by the wife do not enable one to answer that question, save inferentially, for it might be thought unlikely that cash takings intended to be diverted, even if used to pay employees in cash for the purpose of avoiding payment of PAYE and NI, would be carefully recorded in the way in which they were in ledgers which might at any time be called for and examined by HDC&#8217;s auditors. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband had no completely satisfactory explanation for what had happened &#8211; it was all a long time ago and he claimed no longer to have access to other company books which might have thrown some further light on this &#8211; but he denied that it showed him skimming off money for his own purposes. The clear impression I was left with having heard all the evidence on the point was that, at worst, this may have been &#8211; and I emphasise may have been; the evidence does not warrant any such finding &#8211; a tax fraud designed to save PAYE and NI. I am in fact very sceptical as to even that, for it is unlikely that the records of such a fraud would have been recorded in such carefully, indeed meticulously, maintained ledgers. And in any event, as one of the forensic accountants, Mr Roger Walton, pointed out in his evidence, such a fraud has a negligible effect on a company&#8217;s profits. It is essentially neutral so far as profits are concerned, because all one is doing is to remove from the income side of the accounts an amount which, because it is going out in wages, could properly have been set off as an expense on the other side of the ledger.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fourthly, the wife relies upon the evidence of a former employee, a Mr G. Mr G&#8217;s evidence is tainted and was, I regret to say, demonstrably unsatisfactory in certain crucial respects. Put shortly, Mr G was offered a sum of &#163;50,000 by the wife to give evidence, that sum to be paid out of whatever the wife recovers in the litigation. Although the wife said that this was a sum which Mr G was owed by way of bonus &#8211; owed, it may be noted, by HDC and not by her &#8211; the fact is that he was being paid for his evidence, knew that he was being paid for his evidence, knew that his evidence was crucial in relation to the allegation of cash dealing, and knew perfectly well what the wife wanted to hear him saying in the witness box. That is what I find insofar as it was not in fact admitted either by the wife or by Mr G. </p>

The truth, insofar as it emerged at all, had to be dragged out of each of them in cross-examination. I am far from satisfied that I have, even now, a frank and accurate account of their discussion. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">More generally, I found Mr G to be an unsatisfactory witness whose evidence could not necessarily be accepted at face value. Mr Moor makes the important point that in certain respects Mr G&#8217;s evidence was corroborated by other evidence or could be shown by other evidence to be correct. That I accept. But the immediate question for present purposes is whether I can safely rely upon his uncorroborated evidence in relation to the &#8216;cash&#8217; allegations. Mr Howard submits that I cannot. I have to agree. Mr Moor rightly says that the ultimate question is not whether Mr G was paid for his evidence but whether his evidence is truthful and reliable. I agree. But my assessment is that in many respects Mr G&#8217;s evidence, even if not consciously false, was far from reliable. I am unable to accept his evidence in the absence of corroboration. Specifically, I am unable to accept his uncorroborated evidence relating to the &#8216;cash&#8217; allegations. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Quite apart from all the other deficiencies in the case the wife seeks to make against the husband, there is, as Mr Howard pointed out, a fundamental difficulty about her case. The matters of which she is able to make specific complaint all took place a long time ago &#8211; in some cases as long ago as 1989/1991 &#8211; and, more to the point, before the installation of HDC&#8217;s current computerised stock control and accounting systems. Mr Walton&#8217;s opinion was that, given this system, cash drawings would only be possible if there was collusive fraud &#8211; that is, fraud colluded in by the relevant members of HDC&#8217;s staff &#8211; and he had found no evidence of it. I accept his evidence. </p>

I also heard evidence from the various employees &#8211; L, W and R &#8211; who would have had to be involved in varying degrees in, or at least aware of, any such fraud. Suffice it to say that I found each of them to be an entirely honest and for the most part entirely reliable witness. None of them, I am satisfied, would have been party to or remained silent in the knowledge of any such fraud, just as I am sure that they would frankly have told me about anything &#8216;fishy&#8217; that might have come to their attention. I bear in mind that they are all employees of HDC, and therefore in a sense beholden to the husband, but all, as I have said, were entirely honest witnesses. All or at least some of them would have known if there was anything wrong going on, as it were, right under their noses. It is clear that none of them was aware of anything out of the ordinary.</p>

In this context it is of interest to note the submissions he makes on behalf of the trustees in the light of all the evidence I have now heard. He suggests that it would appear difficult to conclude that there has been significant undeclared cash trading on the basis of the evidence put before the court. He records the trustees&#8217; assessment as being that there are grave difficulties in placing any substantial weight on Mr G&#8217;s evidence. He submits that I simply cannot be satisfied that Mr G&#8217;s evidence was the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. In contrast, he submits that I can safely rely on the evidence of L as indicating that, whatever may have happened in the past, the systems now in place at HDC make it very difficult if not impossible for any significant volume of cash trading to take place.</p>

But it is interesting that the trustees, who I am quite satisfied have no particular axe to grind and whose only concern is to safeguard the position of their beneficiaries, should be so singularly unimpressed with what has emerged in relation to allegations which, if they had substance, the trustees would have every interest in pursuing themselves on behalf of their beneficiaries.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the allegation that HDC&#8217;s business has been diverted to FHP, Mr Moor identifies the two issues to be addressed: (i) was there parallel trading? and (ii) if so, what was the level of the husband&#8217;s knowledge and involvement?</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That there was parallel trading, that FHP was undercutting HDC, and moreover using HDC&#8217;s processing facilities to do so (and at a cost unduly advantageous to FHP), and that the effect of all this may in principle have been to divert some profit away from HDC, is pretty clear, just as it is a fair inference that the fact that FHP was established less than a month after the wife obtained the first freezing order is more than a mere coincidence. But this of itself does not take the wife very far. For unless she can demonstrate, and in my judgment she cannot, that the husband was in some way involved in or privy to what FHP was up to, the only outcome would be to leave HDC in a position where, if it was minded to, it might be able to pursue a claim against FHP &#8211; in reality against those, Simon and Melinda, responsible for its activities &#8211; assuming that is, that it could be shown that FHP did actually divert profit away from HDC. </p>

Mr Howard also points to the evidence of both the forensic accountants, Mr Walton and Ms Julia Walker, agreeing that this level of profit would have no impact on the valuation of HDC, because it does not add any goodwill &#8211; a hardly surprising conclusion, as Mr Howard points out, bearing in mind that FHP traded for only two years, the second at a loss, and is now dormant.

After all, Simon, whose destiny was strongly linked with HDC but who held only one share, must have been concerned about the possible ramifications for him of the freezing order. And this is not mere speculation. Simon did not give evidence but Melinda did and, as Mr Moor pointed out, she admitted whilst giving evidence that &#8220;my intention was to get some income away from HDC.&#8221; Moreover, as Mr Howard points out, there is not a shred of evidence showing that any of the money made by FHP has ever reached the husband.</p>

I bear in mind Mr Moor&#8217;s caution to me not to rely too uncritically upon Melinda&#8217;s evidence, but on this crucial point I accept her evidence. W described to me how when she had asked the husband about FHP he had replied that he did not know anything about such a customer. It was plain that she believed him when he said this.

Moreover, even if HDC does in principle have a cause of action either against FHP and/or against Simon and/or Melinda, it does not seem to me that there can in reality be any value in such a claim. On the contrary, the consequences for HDC were it even to think about suing Simon and Melinda would in all probability be little short of disastrous for HDC, given the centrality of Simon&#8217;s role in HDC.</p>

I do not agree for, as Mr Howard himself submits, if the wife wishes to acquire the Antigua property as part of her divorce settlement she can do so only by purchasing it from HDC (no doubt using monies paid to her as part of the divorce settlement) and on the basis, for otherwise neither HDC nor the trustees are likely to agree to such a sale, that she indemnifies HDC against the tax liability.</p>

The figure of &#163;227,943 has two components: most of it comprises monies advanced to enable the payment of litigation costs incurred by the husband and by the trustees; &#163;40,000 represents additional drawings in the normal course. I agree with Mr Moor that it is not appropriate to make any adjustment to reflect drawings in relation to costs (see further below). But an adjustment in relation to the &#163;40,000 (to which has to be added tax of &#163;13,333) is appropriate, so I propose to reduce Mr Walton&#8217;s net valuation figure of &#163;2,763,029 to &#163;2,709,695.</p>

He points out that, although the husband must have known the true position which would be revealed by the full accounts for the year to 30 June 2005 when they subsequently became available, he was silent on the matter whilst giving evidence before me in December 2005. So, he says, the husband is not to be relied upon. He questions the gloomy picture of HDC&#8217;s future prospects painted by the husband. He points out that very large sums of money are being spent on plant and machinery &#8211; which must betoken some degree of confidence in HDC&#8217;s future prospects and which is in any event likely, together with other initiatives being proposed by the husband, to improve both productivity and profitability. He points also to parts of the husband&#8217;s own evidence recognising both that the poor results in the year to 30 June 2006 were in part due to exceptional circumstances and that trade, which has recently up-turned, is currently good and profitable. Mr Howard, for his part, submits that there is no reason for me not to take the management accounts at face value and that the up-turn in trade relied on by Mr Moor does not betoken a long-term improvement.</p>

He submits that &#8220;it is hard to conceive how there could conceivably be any goodwill in this business with the spectre of Avian flu &#8230; it really makes no sense to attribute goodwill to such a threatened business &#8230; it is inconceivable in the current situation that anyone would pay &#163;1.8 million for the goodwill of this business. The proposition is absurd because the spectre of Avian flu removes the goodwill.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, and in any event, he submits that Ms Walker&#8217;s valuation of the goodwill ignores the essential, if at present notional, remuneration costs of the husband and Simon. As he points out, both Mr Walton and Ms Walker had proceeded in their Fourth Joint Statement on the agreed basis that the profits should be further adjusted to take into account notional remuneration, though they differed as to whether this should be, as Mr Walton would say, &#163;145,000 for the years to 30 June 2003 and 2004 and &#163;195,000 thereafter, or, as Ms Walker would say, &#163;125,000 throughout. As Mr Howard also points out, referring to the adjusted net profit figures which I have set out in the last two columns of the Table, Mr Walton&#8217;s figures produce an average adjusted net profit over the four years of only &#163;130,000, whilst even Ms Walker&#8217;s average is only &#163;175,250. It is therefore, he submits, quite impossible to justify a goodwill calculation based upon future maintainable earnings of &#163;450,000, quite apart from the fact that 2006 in fact constituted a loss. Mr Moor&#8217;s only reasoned response to this complaint is to point out, correctly but, in the light of my findings, irrelevantly, that Ms Walker has arrived at her valuation without including any add-back for FHP&#8217;s trading or for undeclared cash takings.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I understand Ms Walker&#8217;s methodology, as set out in Note 3 to Appendix 4 to the Fourth Joint Statement &#8211; and this after all reflects the fundamental principle that goodwill is the difference (if any) between the total value of a company assessed by capitalising its profit stream and the total value of its tangible assets &#8211;, once one has calculated the figure (in Note 3, &#163;3,150,000) obtained by applying the appropriate p/e multiplier (in Ms Walker&#8217;s view, 10) to the future maintainable earnings net of tax at 30% (in her view, &#163;450,000 less tax of &#163;135,000), one has to deduct the value of the business assets to be sold which, on the values she and Mr Walton have agreed, amounts, as I have said, to no less than &#163;1,305,683. In other words, there is only any goodwill in HDC if the capitalised value of its anticipated profits exceeds &#163;1,305,683.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Similar calculations to those undertaken by Ms Walker (and in each case assuming future maintainable net earnings of &#163;450,000 and a p/e multiplier of 10) show that if one takes her own average adjusted profit figure of &#163;175,250, the resulting figure is only &#163;1,226,750. In other words there is no goodwill. If one takes an adjusted profit figure of &#163;255,000 (that is, &#163;450,000 less notional remuneration costs in Mr Walton&#8217;s figure of &#163;195,000) the resulting figure is &#163;1,785,000, producing a figure for goodwill, after deducting &#163;1,305,683, of &#163;479,317. The comparable figure if one takes Ms Walker&#8217;s remuneration figure of &#163;125,000 is &#163;2,275,000 which, after deducting &#163;1,305,683, produces a figure for goodwill of &#163;969,317. If one takes the mid-point between Mr Walton&#8217;s figure and Ms Walker&#8217;s figure, ie, &#163;160,000, the comparable figure is &#163;2,030,000, producing a figure for goodwill of &#163;724,317.</p>

The goodwill figures of course reduce if one takes a lower p/e multiplier. Thus, for example, if one takes Ms Walker&#8217;s remuneration figure of &#163;125,000 and applies a p/e multiple of 5 the resulting figure is only &#163;1,137,500, which being less than &#163;1,305,683 shows that there is no good will. One can re-work the calculation the other way. Taking Mr Walton&#8217;s remuneration figure of &#163;195,000, and still assuming that the maintainable profits are &#163;450,000, there will be no goodwill unless the appropriate p/e multiplier is at least 7.315. If one takes the mid-point remuneration figure of &#163;160,000, but otherwise making the same assumption, there will be no goodwill unless the appropriate p/e multiplier is at least 6.432.</p>

What, as it seems to me, the various calculations indicate, is that there will not be any very significant goodwill unless both (a) there is a significant gap between the figure for maintainable net profits (making no allowance for notional remuneration costs) and the notional remuneration costs and (b) a p/e multiple significantly higher than 5 can be justified. </p>

He submits that the distancing of herself from CWM is a &#8220;charade&#8221;, that she has merely &#8220;parked it&#8221; in her daughter&#8217;s name to await the end of the proceedings, and that when the dust has settled she will indeed &#8216;take up the reins&#8217; again. He points to the fact that the wife&#8217;s daughter was brought into CWM only nine days after the divorce proceedings were commenced on 22 May 2001.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Howard says that on the wife&#8217;s own admission CWM made gross profits of some &#163;830,000 over a period of about 10 years. He submits that I should value CWM on the basis that it has a sustainable earning capacity of &#163;80,000 per annum gross (though he had to concede that the accounts for the year to 31 May 2000, when the wife was still a sole trader, showed profits of only &#163;24,500) and suggests that on the basis of maintainable gross profits of &#163;80,000 CWM &#8220;probably&#8221; has a value if sold on the open market of over &#163;1,000,000. Mr Moor describes the last submission as &#8220;remarkable&#8221; and points out that it is a figure which has no evidential foundation and which, indeed, was first mentioned in written submissions that Mr Howard delivered on 12 September 2006, well after the evidence had concluded. Mr Moor&#8217;s submissions were delivered on 18 September 2006. Mr Howard&#8217;s submissions in reply dated 2 November 2006 were largely silent on the subject of CWM.</p>

But so far as concerns CWM I am not prepared to find that her evidence was other than frank and honest. I accept that she has divested herself of CWM in favour of her daughter and I cannot say that, in all the circumstances, it was unreasonable of her to do so. I recognise that it may be that her daughter will indeed, after the dust has settled, either take the wife back into the business or in some other way enable the wife to share in the profits of CWM&#8217;s business. But that is no more a resource that can be taken into account in any quantified manner than the husband&#8217;s hopes or expectations under the trusts. I should add that I am, in any event, wholly unpersuaded that CWM is worth anything like as much as Mr Howard would have me believe.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Drum Grange, as I have said, has now been sold for &#163;2,700,000. The net proceeds of sale are payable, it is accepted, as to 25% &#8211; &#163;674,130 &#8211; to the wife and as to 75% to HDC. HDC&#8217;s interest in the proceeds of sale has been taken into account in the valuation of HDC, as has the value of the property in Antigua. The contents of Drum Grange are worth approximately &#163;80,000 and it is accepted that they should go to the wife. The wife has jewellery worth &#163;23,000. The husband&#8217;s pension fund, as I have said, is worth &#163;717,576 and he has shares in a quoted company worth &#163;13,489. The wife has a car which she values at &#163;11,000 and the husband at &#163;15,000. I propose to proceed on the basis of the wife&#8217;s figure. The husband has a car which he bought in 2003 for &#163;104,000 but which, according to Mr Howard, relying on Glass&#8217;s guide, is worth only &#163;47,000. The husband&#8217;s car has a number plate which is said by Mr Moor to have &#8220;considerable&#8221; value; I have no evidence on the point. There is dispute about the amount which the husband may have in an account at Lloyds TSB, though it would seem not to be very large. Mr Moor submits, with the support of Ms Walker, that I should treat the husband as having additional capital of &#163;175,000 (representing what he suggests is the aggregate value of the husband&#8217;s car and number plate, the monies in the Lloyds TSB account and what is referred to as &#8220;money unreasonably removed from HDC&#8221; by the husband and Simon through extravagant drawings on their directors&#8217; loan accounts). Mr Howard rightly disputes this.</p>

The case was originally fixed for eight days starting so near the end of term in Michaelmas 2005 that there were only that number of sitting days before the end of term. It seemed to me that the time estimate was almost certainly inadequate. I warned the parties that I would not be able to sit beyond the end of term or at the beginning of the next term and that if the case had to be adjourned part-heard it would almost inevitably, because of my other judicial commitments, have to be adjourned for some months at least. Counsel nonetheless decided to proceed rather than adjourning the case so that it could be re-fixed with a more realistic time estimate. The very thing I had feared would happen did happen. Term ended with the husband&#8217;s evidence not yet completed and without my having heard any of the expert evidence. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I had feared, it was not possible to resume for many months &#8211; not in fact until July 2006. The parties had assured me that five further days would suffice. By the end of the fifth day, when Mr Howard had to leave for his pre-booked holiday, we had finished the evidence, but there had been no time for any closing submissions. I therefore gave directions providing for the lodging of written submissions over the Long Vacation. The parties understandably wanted the opportunity to make oral submissions. Because of my other judicial commitments and counsel&#8217;s professional commitments it was not possible for those to be heard until November 2006, almost exactly eleven months after the trial had begun. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The delay is most regrettable. But I am satisfied that it has not caused any injustice. I was provided with a transcript of all the evidence that had been heard in December 2005 and the provision of written submissions gave all parties the opportunity to prepare their final submissions at leisure. Those written submissions, for which I am most grateful, enormously eased the burden on me.</p>
