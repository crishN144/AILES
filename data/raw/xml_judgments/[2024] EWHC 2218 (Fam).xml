The Appellant&#8217;s case has evolved. The Respondent submitted a Position Statement late and that late submission caused a delay to the start of the appeal. I granted leave to appeal the order of Recorder Searle. Despite permission being granted to appeal, the Respondent maintained that the appeal before me was a backdoor appeal. That was an argument that I thus had to revisit and which I ultimately rejected. Doing so elongated the appeal and lead to judgment being reserved. I have stood back and considered the litigation conduct of both parties in this case. Having done so I have concluded that whilst both parties&#8217; behaviours have on occasion been frustrating, neither&#8217;s behaviour can be categorized as reprehensible. </span></p>
