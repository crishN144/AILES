The relationship between the intervenors and the husband broke down shortly thereafter.  Each side will say the other was to blame.  This appears to be the seed of the dispute between the intervenors and the husband, and which eventually led to the litigation between them, the husband, the wife and ML, commenced in October 2019, whereby the intervenors were seeking redress for what they said was a failure to implement the terms of the shareholders&#8217; agreement to transfer the beneficial ownership of [Company A]/[ Company B] to [Company X] Ltd once the value of [Company A]/[ Company B] reached &#163;5m.  The intervenors alleged that as a result, they suffered loss in the form of revenue from the activities from [Company A] and the missed opportunity to have a stake in [Company B], which was, they say, to be the umbrella company for a whole range of sporting online TV channels, with associated benefits in the form of sponsorship and merchandising deals.</p>

The husband will say that he was becoming increasingly frustrated with being told at meetings that he was entitled to nothing at all from the business, when he was the one who was working full-time to generate all its income, and when he says the business was entirely based on his media persona, his knowledge and contacts, and the content he created.</p>

The wife and the intervenors assert that the husband stripped out [Company A] from [Company B], in order to deprive the wife of any meaningful interest in the business, and that he has acted selfishly and dishonestly by then seeking to transfer ownership of [Company A] to a separate holding company.

The wife and the intervenors have alleged that the husband has deprived them of their fair share of hundreds of thousands of pounds of income and of a valuable share in the business as a whole.  Having the majority shareholding in [Company B] gave the intervenors standing to participate in legal actions against the husband (in respect of the trademark application and in respect of the loss of income from [Company A]).  The evidence given by the intervenors was that they had so far spent &#163;44,000 plus VAT in respect of the trademark litigation, and &#163;105,000 plus VAT on pre-proceedings work in respect of the [Company B] litigation.  This is some indication of the value that they place on the potential gains from the litigation.  The shares were plainly not worthless to them.</p>

This argument is disingenuous and has no force.  Secondly, he said he did not consider there was a need to notify until the share transfer and appointment of him and his uncle as directors had taken place.  These are poor excuses.  It is clear from the terms of the agreement itself that the reason for the delay was to conceal the truth from the husband and ML, because if they knew what was happening, they would not have entered into the settlement agreement and paid &#163;250,000 to the intervenors, and would likely have taken action to prevent the shares being transferred to them;</p>
