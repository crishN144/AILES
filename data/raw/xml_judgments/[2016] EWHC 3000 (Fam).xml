This is a rehearing, the previous final order of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> June 2010 having been set aside by Moor J on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2015 because of the husband&#8217;s non-disclosure in respect of his interest in two trusts.</p>

	      <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.57in">The wife&#8217;s case is that she should receive an equal share of the parties&#8217; current resources including the assets in the trusts.  Mr Pointer submits that the sharing which took place in 2010 is of no continuing relevance because it was procured by the husband&#8217;s non-disclosure and the wife is entitled to have her award determined by reference to the current position.  Accordingly the wife seeks a lump sum of &#163;14 million plus, in the event of the sale of a company called Group Silverline Ltd, an additional sum equal to 40% of &#8220;any excess value&#8221; over the current value of the company.</p>

The other assets were shared in 2010 in a manner which was and remains fair.  The husband, therefore, proposes that the wife should receive a lump sum of &#163;3.65 million, being a third of the value of the trusts&#8217; assets as at 2010 plus 15% &#8220;compensation&#8221;.</p>

I will consider this in more detail below but, in summary, it is clear from Lady Hale&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Sharland v Sharland</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] 2 FLR 1367" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] 2 FLR 1367</ref> that &#8220;there is enormous flexibility to enable the procedure to fit the case&#8221; (para 43).  In some cases this will require the court to &#8220;start from scratch&#8221; (para 43) but in others it will not: as in <span style="font-style:italic">Kingdon v Kingdon</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 FLR 1409" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 FLR 1409</ref>.</p>

He was subsequently given an interest in the company which was then sold in 1999.  The husband received &#163;15 million.  He purchased what became Group Silverline Ltd (&#8220;Silverline&#8221;).

The husband lent his brother (over time) &#163;1 million but he was not otherwise engaged in this business which became Silverline&#8217;s biggest customer.  There was an informal agreement between the husband and his brother that a percentage of the shares in Toolstation would be treated as being held by the brother for the husband&#8217;s benefit.</p>

The husband&#8217;s brother says that, rather than transfer cash, it was agreed that his parents would invest in Toolstation and subsequently transfer their shares.  The husband&#8217;s parents acquired 10 million shares in the company.  In due course they decided to give 3 million shares to each of their children.</p>

The trustees are the husband&#8217;s brother and his parents.  The beneficiaries are the husband and his descendants, being currently his five children (two of whom are minors).  I have read a statement from the husband&#8217;s brother, provided for the set aside proceedings, but have otherwise received no evidence from the trustees.  Moor J found that the husband is the principal beneficiary of the Trusts.</p>

As explained by the husband&#8217;s brother, in fact, to simplify the process, he transferred 2,580,460 shares to the Eagle Trust and his parents transferred 6 million shares to the Hardy Trust.  </p>

He is the sole shareholder.  In his oral evidence the husband said that this cost &#163;1.6 million of which &#163;1 million was lent by the husband&#8217;s father and &#163;600,000 was provided by the Trusts.</p>

This valued his assets at &#163;14.26 million, including only half of the former matrimonial home (at &#163;1.57 million), plus pensions of &#163;430,000.  The husband&#8217;s business interests were valued at &#163;9.7 million.  His shares in Silverline were valued at &#163;5.4 million and his shares in Powerbox AG at &#163;600,000.  The former was a desktop valuation provided by accountants (specifically a Mr O&#8217;Donnell).  The latter was based on the amount paid by the husband for the purchase of the company in March 2009.</p>

As Mr Greene has said, valuation is not an exact science.  The differential is just over 10% in the value of these assets and less than 5% of the total resources in 2010 excluding the Trusts&#8217; assets.  Further, once the loan from the husband&#8217;s father is taken into account, which it would have to be, the total based on Mr Greene&#8217;s valuations becomes less than the &#163;6 million figure given by the husband in 2010.</p>

This identifies two remaining issues between the parties.  The combined total, excluding the assets in the Trusts (including the husband&#8217;s loan), is &#163;22.8/&#163;24.2 million (including the shares in Silverline and Powerbox valued at &#163;16.1 million and pensions of &#163;670,000).

One appraisal, from Savills, suggested an asking price of CHF4.5 million with a &#8220;margin for negotiation (normally 5-8%)&#8221;.  If this margin is applied, the value is between CHF4.28 and CHF4.14 million (an average of CHF4.2 million).  The other appraisal, from FIMA Architecture, gave a provisional estimate of CHF3.6 million.  If it were necessary for me to do so, I would take a figure of CHF3.9 million as providing a sufficient indication of the gross value of the property for the purposes of my judgment.</p>

In his written opening Mr Pointer deployed a number of what, with respect to him, I consider to be rather convoluted arguments.  First, he submitted that &#8220;it is clear&#8221; from <span style="font-style:italic">Cowan v Cowan</span> that at the date of separation the wife had an expectation &#8220;of a proportion (half) of the &#8230; shares that were held in the trusts&#8221;.  It is not clear to me how <span style="font-style:italic">Cowan</span> provides any support for this proposition.  Next, he submitted that even if these shares should be treated differently, the principle from <span style="font-style:italic">Re Hallett&#8217;s Case</span> (1880) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="13 Ch D 696" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">13 Ch D 696</ref> should be applied so that the funds spent from the Trusts should be treated as coming from the husband&#8217;s own money first and not the wife&#8217;s or joint money.  I struggle to see how this principle is relevant or applies as submitted by Mr Pointer.  In any event, in his final submissions, Mr Pointer accepted that the shares contributed by the husband&#8217;s parents were not marital assets.</p>

He, additionally, points to the need to take into account the interests of the other beneficiaries, to Toolstation being the husband&#8217;s brother&#8217;s company and to the fact that the Trusts realised a very substantial part of their interests in Toolstation in the years after the parties separated.</p>

Taking Mr Pym&#8217;s valuation for the Toolstation shares, the Trusts&#8217; assets totalled &#163;14.8 million.  Deducting 35% to reflect the parents&#8217; shares gives &#163;9.6 million.  33% of this sum equals &#163;3.17 million; adding 15% (&#163;476,000) gives a total of &#163;3.65 million.

Much may remain uncontentious.  It may be possible to isolate the issues to which the misrepresentation or non-disclosure relates and deal only with those.

First, it undermined the basis on which his shareholding had been valued and &#8216;therefore the ability of the wife to address the proportionality of agreeing a discount below her claimed 50% &#8230; against the receipt of a larger share of the other family assets&#8217;.  Secondly, it created a false basis for the wife to assume that a delayed realisation of the husband&#8217;s shareholding might justify a tapered reduction in her share of the proceeds (para [30]).  Once the judge had decided that the husband&#8217;s fraud had undermined the parties&#8217; agreement and the consent order, that should have been the end of the matter.  There were three inter-related reasons for this ...&#8221;</p>

There is nothing wrong with the order dated 18 April 2005 save that it requires such an addition.  There is no need to dismantle it: the need is to add to it.

I do not accept Mr Pointer&#8217;s submissions including that, if the wife had known about the cash held by the Trusts, she may well have &#8220;opted&#8221; to receive some of her award by way of shares in Silverline.  This was not explored during the hearing but I see no prospect of this either having been agreed or being ordered by the court.  It was the husband&#8217;s business and the court would not have given the wife shares in it unless a fair award could not otherwise be achieved.  Plainly, it could.</p>

	      <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.57in">Further, if I was to undertake the discretionary exercise by reference to the current value of the resources, I would have to make considerable allowance for the fact that the current values of Silverline and Powerbox reflect the husband&#8217;s work over the course of the last 6 years.  Indeed, it would be easy to conclude that the difference between the values given for 2010 and the current values are not the product of marital endeavour.  The husband has not been trading (per <span style="font-style:italic">Cowan</span>) or gambling (per <span style="font-style:italic">H v H</span>) with the wife&#8217;s share because the resources as disclosed, including the husband&#8217;s interests in these companies, were shared in 2010.  </p>

This is too remote.  As referred to above, the current value of the business is the product of post-separation endeavour, as between the husband and the wife, and gives her no entitlement to a further share in addition to that which she received in 2010.</p>

Further, the fact that the value of the shares was not realised until after the end of the marriage does not affect their potential quality as marital assets.  The husband did not work in the business.  The husband was entitled to the shares to reflect the sums he had lent his brother.  The fact that Toolstation was the brother&#8217;s company does not, in my view, alter the fact that the shares were by way of an investment.  Nor do I accept his submission that the wife&#8217;s claim should be determined by reference to 2010 values.  This would be wholly artificial when the true figures are known.  </p>

Superficially the question is easily framed as being whether the trust is a financial &#8216;resource' of the husband for the purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25(2)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>).  But what does the word &#8216;resource' mean in this context?  In my view, when properly focused, that central question is simply whether, if the husband were to request it to advance the whole (or part) of the capital of the trust to him, the trustee would be likely to do so.  In other cases the question has been formulated in terms of whether the spouse has real or effective control over the trust.  At times I have myself formulated it in that way.  But, unless the situation is one in which there is ground for doubting whether the trustee is properly discharging its duties or would be likely to do so, it seems to me on reflection that such a formulation is not entirely apposite. On the evidence so far assembled in the present case, as in most cases, there seems no reason to doubt that the duties of the trustee are being, and will continue to be, discharged properly.&#8221;</span></p>

Mr Amos has referred to passages in the husband&#8217;s brother&#8217;s statement but these are of a very general nature, namely that in 2012 he was &#8220;conscious of my obligations as a trustee, so wanted to make sure that not all the funds were being distributed and a greater degree of control was being exercised&#8221;.  Mr Amos also refers to the fact that, since 2012, the Trusts have lent, not distributed, funds to the husband.</p>

This is clear from the evidence to which I have referred in the previous paragraph and from the amount distributed and lent since 2010.  The court would have answered the <span style="font-style:italic">Charman</span> question in the affirmative to that extent (i.e. 65%) and might well have gone further.  On this basis the wife would have been awarded 32.5% of the Trusts&#8217; assets, by way of lump sums, payable by the husband as and when those assets were realised.  I do not discount this percentage to reflect the fact that the husband was retaining illiquid assets (namely his business shares).  This discount is already reflected in the unequal division effected in 2010.  To take this factor into account again would be double counting.</p>

The Trusts have received &#163;21.45 million net.  Of this 35%, namely &#163;7.5 million, represents non-marital resources, leaving a balance of &#163;13.95 million.  In my view, as explained above, this is all marital wealth.  &#163;1.5 million had been distributed prior to the 2010 order and was, therefore, taken into account at that time.  This leaves &#163;12.45 million.  If this were to be distributed equally between the parties the wife would be entitled to a lump sum of &#163;6.22 million.  The husband could only pay this if the Trusts gave him the funds to do so.  This would leave the Trusts with assets of &#163;6.45 million (including the loans).</p>

The first is that the wife would have received this element of her award earlier than now because she would have received payments in instalments (mainly in 2015 with a smaller sum in 2012), as the Trusts&#8217; interests in Toolstation were realised.  I do not include the earlier receipts (post 2010) because the distributions then made to the husband, which left the Trusts with almost no cash, were used by him to repay the loan he had taken to pay the wife &#163;3 million in 2010.</p>

Clearly, the remaining instalments (of approximately &#163;280,000) should be accelerated.  I will determine the date by when payment should be made when I make my order.</p>

Whilst I am not entirely happy with the concept that the sum I award to reflect these factors is arbitrary, I take it that Wilson LJ meant discretionary rather than susceptible to the application of a precise formula.  I propose to increase the wife&#8217;s award, excluding the sum of &#163;280,000, by &#163;200,000, making a total of &#163;6.42 million.</p>
