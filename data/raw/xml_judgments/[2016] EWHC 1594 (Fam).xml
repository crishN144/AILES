The court had concerns about the status and legality of the agreement entered into in Thailand, in addition to which there were the financial payments made in Thailand to the clinic and the surrogate which would require consideration under s 54(8). </span></p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Section 54 goes to the most fundamental aspects of status and, transcending even status, to the very identity of the child as a human being: who he is and who his parents are. It is central to his being, whether as an individual or as a member of his family. As Ms Isaacs correctly puts it, this case is fundamentally about X&#8217;s identity and his relationship with the commissioning parents. Fundamental as these matters must be to commissioning parents they are, if anything, even more fundamental to the child. A parental order has, to adopt Theis J&#8217;s powerful expression, a transformative effect, not just in its effect on the child&#8217;s legal relationships with the surrogate and commissioning parents but also, to adopt the guardian&#8217;s words in the present case, in relation to the practical and psychological realities of X&#8217;s identity. A parental order, like an adoption order, has an effect extending far beyond the merely legal. It has the most profound personal, emotional, psychological, social and, it may be in some cases, cultural and religious, consequences. It creates what Thorpe LJ in Re J (Adoption:  Non-Patrial) [1998] INLR 424, 429, referred to as &#8220;the psychological relationship of parent and child with all its far-reaching manifestations and consequences.&#8221; Moreover, these consequences are lifelong and, for all practical purposes, irreversible: see G v G (Parental Order: Revocation) [2012] EWHC 1979 (Fam), [2013] 1 FLR 286, to which I have already referred. And the court considering an application for a parental order is required to treat the child&#8217;s welfare throughout his life as paramount: see in In re L (A Child) (Parental Order: Foreign Surrogacy) [2010] EWHC 3146 (Fam), [2011] Fam 106, [2011] 1 FLR 1143. X was born in December 2011, so his expectation of life must extend well beyond the next 75 years. Parliament has therefore required the judge considering an application for a parental order to look into a distant future.&#8221;</span></p>

The applicants addressed this issue in their statement at paragraphs 29-38, and exhibited a notarised memorandum from a Miss Kulkanya Vorawanichar, a lawyer working for Watson Farley &amp; Williams (Thailand) Ltd. The memorandum set out that at the time of the conception and of the birth of the children there were no laws directly relating to the practice of surrogacy in force, meaning that surrogacy was not illegal at the time in Thailand. To the best of Miss Vorawanichar&#8217;s knowledge there had been no judgment which had addressed the issue of surrogacy in the Thai Supreme court.</span></p>

In response to an amendment tabled by the Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Hansard, col 246), to permit the making of a parental order in favour of one person, Dawn Primarolo, Minister of State, Department of Health, (cols 248-249) said; </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">"Surrogacy is a complex area. I shall start by responding to the hon. Gentleman. As far as surrogacy is concerned, the mother who gives birth is the mother. Parental orders, like adoption orders, transfer parenthood after birth. In my view, there is a difference, and I will seek to explain why before asking him not to press the amendments. Under the 1990 Act, it is possible to make parental orders transferring parenthood only to married couples. The Bill extends the provisions to include civil partners and couples who are not in a civil partnership or married, but who are living as partners in an enduring relationship. A parental order is awarded by a court, subject to the report of the parental order reporter, who visits the parties concerned and prepares a report on whether the provisions of the law are met &#8211; for example, whether the woman who carried the child has freely given her unconditional consent.&#8221;</span></p>

The Bill does not extend parental orders to single people. As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendments seek to change that with regard to surrogacy. It is interesting to note that surrogacy has rarely featured in the scrutiny and the debates that have taken place on the review of the 1990 Act and the Bill. Arguments for the change to access to parental orders, which the amendments seek, have surfaced only recently.&#8221; </span></p>

That recognises the magnitude of a situation in which a person becomes pregnant with the express intention of handing the child over to someone else, and the responsibility that that places on the people who will receive the child. There is an argument, which the Government have acknowledged in the Bill, that such a responsibility is likely to be better handled by a couple than a single man or woman. I would say to the hon. gentleman that there is a difference. His point was that single people are able to adopt and to receive IVF, so why can they not get a parental order over surrogacy? The difference is this: adoption involves a child who already exists and whose parents are not able to keep the child, for whom new parents are sought. That is different, which is why there is no parallel. IVF involves a woman becoming pregnant herself and giving birth to her child &#8211; there is not a direct parallel. Surrogacy, however, involves agreeing to hand over a child even before conception. The Government are still of the view that the magnitude of that means that it is best dealt with by a couple. </span></p>

Clause 54 relates to how parenthood may be transferred by a court order when a woman has carried a child as a surrogate on behalf of a couple who cannot have children themselves. Under the 1990 Act, parental orders transferring parenthood can only be made for married couples. As I have mentioned, the Bill extends the provision to include civil partners and couples who are not married or in a civil partnership but who live as partners in an enduring family relationship, which is what the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s questions deal with. When the 1990 Act was introduced, it included a provision allowing married couples who had had a child through surrogacy before the Act came into force to apply retrospectively for a parental order. The Bill mirrors that by including a similar provision for people who were not entitled to apply for a parental order before because they were not married. They must apply within six months of clause 54 coming into force.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s amendment would add that a couple applying retrospectively must have been in a relationship for a minimum of 12 months if they are not married or in a civil partnership. Surrogacy can be a route that couples look to when they are unable to have children themselves, and I do not believe&#8212;I am sure that members of the Committee do not either&#8212;that couples would enter into it lightly. The process of a couple deciding that they are both happy with such an arrangement is complex, and they have to find a surrogate who would be suitable to carry their child. That can take a number of years, so in most cases, the couple will have gone through the process together. In addition, when the court is considering the application, it would have to be satisfied that the couple were in an enduring family relationship for the parental order to be granted. As part of that consideration, it is more than likely that the court will consider the length of the couple&#8217;s relationship as well as their commitment to each other. The Government are prepared to continue with the arrangement whereby the family division of the High Court would take the decisions on what made for an enduring relationship that was suitable and in the best interests of the child for a parental order to be made.</span></p>

Gentleman referred, because to make an application to the court under section 54, if the couple are not married or in a civil partnership, they must be in an enduring family relationship. Therefore, it is not necessary for it to be in the legislation in the way that the hon. Gentleman is suggesting. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree with the principle that the family division of the High Court, with its experience, is the best place to test whether a relationship is an enduring one. That decision is better made by the courts than by Parliament seeking to put in place arbitrary time periods or definitions, however well-meaning we may want to be. The ultimate test when issuing the parental order is what is best for the child.&#8221;</span></p>

In this case the applicants began their relationship in April 2014 when the first applicant P had already entered into a surrogacy agreement with the respondent. It is their case that their relationship was based on their shared desire and commitment to becoming parents together; but the fact that P had already entered into a surrogacy agreement and that parental orders are only available to couples raised questions, about their commitment to each other and to any children born as a result of an agreement initiated and entered into by P on his own, for the POR which were entirely understandable. P had had a previous civil partnership from 2007 until its dissolution on 25 September 2012 and he explained to the POR (during her visit to the family at home) that he wanted children whilst his previous partner did not; this was something that he had in common with B. B, too, had wanted children and ended his previous relationship as his partner did not see himself as a parent. </span></p>

I am unable to identify with any precision the amount the respondent received &#8220;other than for expenses reasonably incurred&#8221; but given that a proportion was for loss of earnings I do not have difficulty in authorising the element of the payment which was made by way of compensation. </span></p>

It is clear to me that the applicants entered into the agreement in Thailand in good faith and that the payments they made to the clinic will have included an element of profit. The applicants were not in a position to negotiate the fees paid to the clinic, which as they said were standard fees for commercial surrogacy in Thailand at that time, and I will authorise the element of payments to the clinic which would have been profit as well as medical procedures, treatment and administrative costs. </span></p>

That is the recommendation of the POR whose report dated 15 December 2015 I have read and already made reference to. The applicants have established a family life with the children under Article 8(1) of the ECHR. Article 8 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child directly applies to this case making parental orders the only and most appropriate means to recognise in law the facts of these children&#8217;s lives now and throughout their lives; the applicants have a relationship with the children as their parents (P is their biological as well as their physiological and emotional parent) and it is necessary to make the parental orders to give legal effect and recognition to the children&#8217;s identities. </span></p>
