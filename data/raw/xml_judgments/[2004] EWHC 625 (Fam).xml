	    <p class="Heading1"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:12pt">This case concerns 2 cross applications for ancillary relief. The Husband&#8217;s being first in time. The matter has been extant since 1998 and has been hotly contested before me for some 7 days. The issues are many but, in the final analysis, relatively simple. The assets are not enormous but the costs are horrific in the context of the parties&#8217; wealth. The schedules which have been put before me show that the Wife&#8217;s costs total &#163;256,861 of which some &#163;154,411 has been paid leaving some &#163;100,000 due and payable. The Husband&#8217;s costs amount to some &#163;315,000 of which some &#163;180,500 </span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:8pt"/><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:12pt">is owed to the firm in which he is an equity partner. </span></p>

	    <p class="Heading1"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:12pt">Of course, insofar as he pays the costs to his firm and this results in profit to the practice, he will be entitled to a 50% share in that profit and so I must bear in mind that his net bill will, in reality, be less than the sum set out above. Another way of looking at his liability is to adopt the rationale set out in Malkinson v Trim in which Lord Justice Chadwick said </span><span style="font-weight:normal">:-</span></p>

The only sensible way in which effect can be given to the indemnity principle is by allowing those costs&#8221;  </span></p>

Despite this, it is immediately apparent, the costs claimed total some &#163;570,000 in context of assets (ignoring all paid and unpaid costs) which are said to range, depending on each side&#8217;s presentation, between &#163;1.378 million (per H) or some  &#163;1.1 million (per W). Thus, it is immediately apparent that the costs are wholly disproportionate to the assets in this case. It would seem that the parties have used between 40 and 50% of their worldly worth in pursuit of the issues in this case</span>. </p>

The FDR failed and the result has been a bitterly contested case where, in reality, because of the costs to be paid there can be no winners. </span></p>

It seems to me that it is vital that cases are placed before the Court in a sensible and cost effective manner &#8211; this means that it is essential that detailed thought is given to the</span><span style="font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:12pt">preparation of the bundles. Only some 5 bundles have been in regular use and (save for the affidavits and reports) only a few documents have been relevant even in those</span><span style="font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:12pt">bundles. The remaining 13 Bundles have only been</span><span style="font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:12pt">used for</span><span style="font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:12pt">occasional references. I consider that a Core bundle should have been prepared. Whilst I appreciate that, on occasions, it can be difficult to know what points may assume significance, I believe that little or no thought was given to the preparation of Bundles. The result has been reams of irrelevant documentation has been produced.</span></p>
	    <p class="Heading1"><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:12pt">Of course, at the end of this Judgment I will have to apportion responsibility for the costs but, as I informed the parties at the outset of this case, monies spent on litigation cannot be used for other (perhaps more important) purposes. At the commencement of this case, I invited the parties to seek to narrow the issues in an attempt to save the running costs of the trial that was done to some extent but, even so, it did not lead to any saving in the daily running costs as the case lasted its allotted 7 days plus a morning for Judgment. The consequence of all this is that the assets may be insufficient to deal with needs and/or there may be liquidity problems &#8211; however, that, in the final analysis, is the choice (or perhaps fault) of the parties.</span></p>

She is a member of a very close-knit family and has 2 younger sisters &#8211; called J and G.

Mr H is 70 years old and his wife will be 70 years old in June 2004. The parents ran a chicken business at M P and, for many years, they were successful and fairly prosperous. Such was their affluence, that they were able to assist the Wife when she commenced her own business at the age of 23 years old in about 1980. </p>

At the outset, the business was nominally held as a partnership with Mr H and Mrs H because they had provided some start up capital and general assistance. But, although her parents were entitled to drawings from the business, they did not take them and, eventually, &#8220;forgave&#8221; the monies that were due to them. The Husband says in 1979 he was already courting the Wife and he assisted her with some start up costs and legal advice. If he did so, I do not consider that his input was of any real importance to the business. </p>

	      <p class="Heading2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The Wife&#8217;s shop has been successful over the years as a result of her personal devotion to it and her commercial nous. I find that it has been built up by a great deal of hard work by her alone. It is now valued by the joint accountant at &#163;216,000. The Husband is dubious as to whether this is an accurate valuation because, he says, the Wife has failed to reveal all her stock. He told me that he had taken stock sheets from the former matrimonial home which showed that, in October 1997, the business had stock (at the lower of cost or realisable value) of &#163;397,000. He had downloaded these stock sheets from the parties&#8217; home computer and removed them when the parties separated. In February 1999 the Wife entered his new home and removed various documents including those stock sheets. Moreover, the Husband says that the Wife was in the habit of receiving cash from customers which was not put through the books. He says that at one time there was &#163;50,000 in the business safes. The Wife denies these contentions. I find that she did remove the stock sheets from either the study at the former matrimonial home or from the Husband&#8217;s home at 23 The C, (I am uncertain as to which, but that does not matter). However, I am sure that the Wife had them in her possession. When she was ordered to produce the records, her then solicitors informed the Husband&#8217;s advisers that the records had been destroyed. They have never surfaced and so there is a lingering doubt as to the real value of the jewellery stock. However, in the final analysis I do not consider that this will affect my Judgment about the fair distribution of the assets. Moreover, whilst there may be an element of cash to this business, I am unable to make any positive findings about whether it has occurred (or more relevantly) whether it still occurs and the amount.</p>

There has been an issue as to whether the joint accountant&#8217;s valuation of the practice is accurate because the work-in-progress has been under valued or incorrectly stated.  A great deal of costs have been expended on that issue. Suffice it to say the joint valuation is now some &#163;67,700 and that is the figure which I propose to adopt. The practice now consists of two equity and one salaried partner. Mr J undertakes commercial work, the Husband - the residential conveyancing and the salaried partner PI litigation. It has some 40 members of staff. The firm has had some hard times but the Husband has told me that the position has now stabilised and that he is hopeful that prospects are better than they have been for some time. The Husband&#8217;s new wife &#8211; E J &#8211; works in the firm as practice manager drawing &#163;18,000 per annum as her salary. </p>

	      <p class="Heading2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The parties have one son called N who was born on the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 1989 &#8211; so he is 14&#189; years old. He attends T College as a weekly boarder. During the marriage, he was a day boy at D High School and the Husband paid his fees at that private school. In September 2000, (without any consultation) the Wife moved N to his present school (thereby increasing the fees due) and then in September 2003, she caused him to become a weekly boarder &#8211; again with no consultation with the Husband. She told me that N wanted to become a boarder as he felt he needed his &#8220;own space&#8221; having been distressed by these continuing proceedings and the attendant ill-feeling that that has been engendered between his parents. He was awarded a scholarship to assist with cost of his boarding (because he was considered a caring member of the school community). His fees are now about &#163;5,000 per term (as opposed to &#163;3,800 as a day boy). The Wife told me that she had not communicated with her Husband about schooling - first because, she knew that he did not want N to continue in private education and, secondly, because all/any communication was very difficult. I consider that it was and (is unfortunate) that the Wife decided that she would not keep N&#8217;s father fully informed and I note that he has not paid any school fees since the summer 2002. It is an essential part of parental responsibility that vital decisions affecting a child&#8217;s life are taken after joint input. If they are not, it inevitably leads to dissatisfaction and problems - for example in this case, in relation to the non-payment of school bills. Since June 2002 the Wife has been solely responsible for the fees. The Husband has said that he could not afford them but I find that he has chosen to spend such resources as he did have on holidays with N so to ensure their continuing relationship (because, as she told me, his weekend contact has virtually ceased). I do not criticise him for this but it does mean that he has not made a proper contribution for the last 20 months odd to his son&#8217;s basic educational needs. It is the Husband&#8217;s case that once he is able to pay (and he hopes this will be soon) he will contribute one half of the fees. I consider that it is very important that he begins to make these payments at the end of this case. I made it clear that I wanted specific proposals and in his final submissions Mr Brudenell on behalf of the Husband indicated that he would start paying next January 2005. The Wife is seeking payments from the Summer term 2004. I am going to order the payments to commence from the Autumn term 2004 &#8211; that is next September.</p>

Road.</span> The plot cost some &#163;12,000 and &#8211; there is no dispute that this money was provided from the Husband&#8217;s savings. The Husband says that he invested a further &#163;13,000 in building costs &#8211; the Wife does not accept this &#8211; but suffice it to say the Husband put all his then monies into their new home. The Wife&#8217;s parents also assisted &#8211; they were quite knowledgeable about building projects and gave valuable assistance in this regard. They also lent funds until the parties were able to borrow &#163;25,000 on mortgage. These monies were used to repay Mr and Mrs H when the project was almost complete. This house was the only home in which the parties lived during the marriage. The Wife continues to live there with N. It is now worth some &#163;280,000 and is subject to a mortgage of &#163;93,500 odd (the latter having been increased [to about &#163;120,000] in 1990 in respect of jointly owned investment properties bought at C). During the marriage the Husband paid the mortgage on this property (and was able to use the rental income from C to defray that expenditure). Since June 1998 the Wife has paid the mortgage. There is no dispute but that at the end of this case, the Wife will have the former matrimonial home transferred into her sole name. It seems that the transfer will cost the Husband some &#163;9,300 in CGT, because, even though PPR relief will be available to him for the period up to June 2000 (given he left the property in 1998), he has to pay CGT in respect of the last 4 odd years. </p>

This suited them both because the Husband had a good knowledge of the property market as a result of his practice and the Wife enjoyed overseeing renovation work. Their first project was a house at <span style="font-weight:bold">48, S Road</span>. It was purchased for &#163;8,250 with monies which emanated solely from the Husband. There is a dispute as to who funded the renovations. I am unable to decide who paid for what but I have no doubt that it was a joint project. It was bought in the Wife&#8217;s sole name and, when it was sold, the net profit was put into another project at <span style="font-weight:bold">No 82, P Street</span> which cost some &#163;21,000. This house was also bought in the Wife&#8217;s sole name but was, as I find, a joint project. When this was sold for &#163;34,950 it seems that the Husband used some &#163;7,500 to repay a car and aeroplane loan. There has been some criticism about these actions and his alleged failure to tell the Wife the truth about the precise sale price. The allegation is that he skimmed off the &#163;7,500 used to repay his loans. If he did not tell her about the exact sale price (and I make no finding about it) it does not seem to me to be of any importance in the context of this case, particularly as the Wife must have signed the conveyancing documents and could (indeed should) have checked the figures for herself.</p>

It was the Wife who found the premises. She was attracted by the rental potential of the 2 cottages and the possibility, as she saw it, of planning permission in relation to the extensive grounds at the rear. She persuaded the Husband that the project would be a good buy. The Wife was able to raise a commercial loan (for a total of &#163;115,000) from her bankers - the Yorkshire Bank &#8211; albeit at a high rate of interest. When the marriage broke down, she sought to argue that C was really &#8220;her&#8221; project and was only put into joint names only because the Husband had persuaded her that this was tax efficient. I do not accept her evidence in this regard. Whilst I have no doubt that she was the driving force behind the project, it was part of a pattern of joint property deals that the parties had undertaken on previous occasions. Indeed, in order to reduce the cost of borrowing the commercial loan was soon repaid with monies (some &#163;109,000) raised against the jointly owned former matrimonial home. I am satisfied that this was done because the parties considered this to be another joint project. The renovation works cost some &#163;50,000 which was funded by a council renovation grant, the net proceeds of P Street and &#163;10,000 from one of the Husband&#8217;s inheritances. </p>

The land was sold because Mrs H was facing potential bankruptcy because her family business had failed. It is the Wife&#8217;s case that the land is still owned by her mother because the sale was a paper transaction to ensure that her mother did not lose the land to her creditors. She says that (i) no consideration passed, the Husband had (ii) backdated the transaction and (iii) had caused the sale to be accomplished at an undervalue. If her allegations were correct the whole transaction would have been a fraud on the creditors. In the event, none of the above allegations was made out by her.  The Husband was able to prove that the Wife had paid for the plots from her Tessa account (into which, inter alia, her modest salary from his previous firm was paid); the land was independently valued and the sale took place at a proper value and the sale was not backdated. Accordingly, I find that the land belongs to the Wife and not her mother. It seems that a great deal of aggravation has been caused by these allegations and the need to disprove them. However, it is symptomatic of the manner in which this case has been conducted that both parties felt the need to expend considerable energy (and therefore costs) on an asset (which in the final analysis) is worth, as I find, some &#163;18,000 net &#8211; and even on the Wife&#8217;s case was worth some &#163;8,000.</p>

	      <p class="Heading2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.26in">The Wife visited the Yorkshire Bank (her own bank) to discover whether they would make the funds available to her. The bank offered some &#163;200,000 to enable a purchase to proceed at &#163;225,000 (which was &#163;30,000 lower than J&#8217;s offer). She offered the farm as security. The Wife planned to buy M P in her sole name. The bank then informed her that they required additional security. She told me in her evidence that when she had left the bank, the loan had been agreed and the only security sought was M P. She told me that she had then asked her husband to deal with the legal matters and, after his involvement, the bank had insisted on additional security. She considered that the Husband was in some way to blame for this state of affairs. She feels that he had manipulated the situation so that he could have his name on the title deeds. This explanation, which was not in any of her affidavits, seems to me to be wholly without foundation. Her earlier case was to the clear effect that the Husband wanted nothing to do with this project and was very reluctant to risk his own assets. This evidence sits in sharp contradistinction with an allegation that the Husband manipulated the bank to ensure that his assets &#8211; namely his share of the C properties &#8211; were required as additional security before the loan was sanctioned. I consider that the more likely explanation is that the bank agreed to lend some &#163;200,000 in principle subject to valuation and/or further investigation and, when those investigations were complete, the relevant bank official decided that M P on its own, was not sufficient security.</p>

Thus, the loan was taken out in the Wife&#8217;s sole name but was supported by a joint mortgage over M P and the C properties. Indeed, the bank documents show that the bank obtained an all monies charge over C and, as such, the Husband stood effective guarantor to all the Wife&#8217;s indebtedness with the bank &#8211; which included her business overdraft. It does not seem that either party appreciated this fact in 1992.</p>

At this time, there is no real suggestion that the marriage was going seriously wrong even though the parties may have some difficulties. Their son was only 4 years old and the real troubles were about 5 years away. As the Husband was an integral part of the negotiations with the receiver (and he was proud of his achievement in that regard) it is inconceivable that he did not tell everyone about his role and his (as he perceived it) generous gesture of putting his own assets on the line.</p>

The H&#8217;s and the M&#8217;s (as they then were) discussed how these sums were to be paid. The Husband put up the initial &#163;5,000 which was subsequently repaid by the H family in a matter of days.  The remaining funds had to be found somehow. Mr H was entitled to a share of &#163;5,000 in the proceeds of sale of his mother&#8217;s bungalow at P. His sister T H<span style="color:#FF0000"/>was entitled to the remainder of the net proceeds because she had purchased the bungalow from her mother at an earlier date (no doubt to assist the old lady with her capital needs). Mr H persuaded his sister that the property should be sold to his daughter G for some &#163;70,000. In reality, by the date this he had already secured another buyer for &#163;100,000. He did not inform his sister of this prospective purchaser at the time. He told me that his sister was content to receive &#163;70,000 because that was the sum that she wanted. He also said that, when eventually she was told of the back to back deal, she was content because (i) he had looked after their mother whilst she lived in J and (ii) he had done work on the property to improve it. I consider that whole scenario and explanation to be dubious but it is not my job to cast aspersions about the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> party transaction. However, it does indicate to me that Mr H was prepared to do anything to secure the farm  -  even if it meant being parsimonious with the truth even to his own sister. It is clear that he regarded the &#163;30,000 profit as &#8220;his&#8221; money albeit that G was the conduit because of his own perilous financial position. Indeed, &#8220;G&#8221; appears to have &#8220;gifted&#8221; part of her profit to the Wife and Husband because some &#163;20,000 of those monies were used to fund the purchase. I do not know what became of the remainder. There is a suggestion in the written evidence that the Husband did not account for the additional amount but he was not questioned about this matter and there is no evidence to support the assertion. </p>

It was not a formal life interest, but it was an understanding and they did not seek to have their position formalised in any way. They did not want their names on the titles Deeds for two very good reasons &#8211; first, because they were facing potential bankruptcy and secondly, it made sensible tax planning if the property was held by the next generation because it avoided potential inheritance tax in the long term. Moroever, they could not have had any beneficial interest in the property because that would have been a fraud on the creditors. </p>

Of this, she only paid the Husband and the Wife &#163;53,000 which then was used to reduce the mortgage. She retained the remaining &#163;20,000 and used it as a deposit to fund her own pharmacy business. As the Husband and the Wife owned M P &#8211; they were legally entitled to the whole amount. However, the H family decided that J deserved the additional funds for the unpaid work that she had undertaken through 1991/2.

I think that one of the difficulties that has bedevilled this case, is the general failure to grasp the fact that he and Mrs H had lost the farm because of the guarantees they gave the Bank.

There was no agreement that the money expended would give the H&#8217;s any interest in the property. It was simply spent and thereafter P P collected the rents from 2 flats and G from the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>.  Without an express agreement, it is clear that the works inured to the benefit of the property. It has been suggested that the funds in some way gave rise to a propriety estoppel in favour of Mr and Mrs H. I shall deal with that issue when I come to consider the Law as it applies to the facts as I have found them. Suffice it to say, Mr and Mrs H were given leave to intervene in these proceedings but chose not to do so. Although, they spent their own monies on the property, they passed the rent through a company &#8211; namely P P - in which they had no interest. I am of the clear view that they did not expect any form of recompense for the improvements which they funded &#8211; rather, they regarded the money as being spent for the benefit of the property.</p>

Thus, from about 1998, the repayments have not reduced the capital outstanding to any significant extent.</p>

On behalf of the Wife, Mr Wood asserts that Mr and Mrs H are the beneficial owners of M P.

In support of his contention Mr Wood sets out in his able written submissions all the facts which he says point to the necessary understanding and payment of capital in this case &#8211; all of which he says point to a Constructive trust. I will not repeat all the facts and matters which are set out at page 5 of his submissions but I have taken each point made fully into account and I have made my own findings of fact which do differ from the gloss which Mr Wood seeks to put on the events that happened in 1992.

	      <p class="Heading2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.13in">Mr Brudenell on behalf of the Husband asserts that the legal and beneficial interest lies with the Husband and Wife. In support of that contention, he points to the chronology of events and to the fact that the mortgage itself states that the parties are legal and beneficial owners. He points out that the H&#8217;s were likely to be made bankrupt and that, as a result, it would be a fraud on the creditors if they were to have an beneficial interest. He refers to the case of <span style="font-weight:bold">Hyett v  Stanley 2003 EWCA Civ 942.</span> This case concerned an unmarried couple (who had been together since 1988) lived in a property solely owned by the man. He had financial difficulties and could not service his debts with the result that the bank required him to secure his borrowings by way of a mortgage. As his income was insufficient, they also required the woman to enter into the charge which then became a joint mortgage. She asked for an interest in the house but the man said that this was unnecessary as she could prove her rights as a result of the mortgage. The Court of Appeal held that a constructive trust arose immediately upon entering into the mortgage by which she had rendered herself jointly and severally liable to considerable debts. As a result of which she had acquired an immediate 50% beneficial interest in the equity of the property because she had acted to her detriment and this was the only reasonable explanation to be inferred from all the circumstances. Mr Brudenell&#8217;s point is that this case is so much the stronger because his client made it clear that he would not act to his detriment, by assuming the liability for the mortgage by securing C, unless he acquired both a legal and beneficial interest in M P.</p>

	      <p class="Heading2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">To my mind the most striking feature in this case is that Mr and Mrs H did not act to their detriment in any way. They were facing potential personal bankruptcy &#8211; their debts were such that any funds which they managed to husband (by fair means or foul) would (and indeed should) have been paid to Lloyds Bank in reduction of their indebtedness. Even after the sale of W and M P they owed the Bank some &#163;280,000 and there were some &#163;200,000 of additional creditors.  Moreover, the sale of the farm to the Husband and the Wife secured them a benefit &#8211; that is a home and the ability to continue to run their chicken business. Even if they spent capital over the years, it was a small price to pay for the facilities that they enjoyed and the lifestyle that it provided. In addition, if they had achieved a beneficial interest that would have been a fraud on the creditors and if they were to be found to have one now that would cause potential Inheritance Tax problems which Mr H was clear he did not want. For all these reasons I find that they do not any beneficial interest under a constructive or resulting trust.</p>

Of course, this couple may decide to move when they retire &#8211; as the chicken business seems fraught with financial difficulties and is hard work. But that will be a matter for them. At the start of this case, I did not have any evidence of the discount to be applied in such circumstances. There was out of date valuation evidence of the reduction for a formal life interest which had not been updated because, as I was told, the Wife&#8217;s Counsel had objected at an earlier directions Hearing. I asked the joint accountant to assist me by giving discount rates based on a 7 &#8211; 5% return on capital. His evidence was to the effective that the appropriate discount rates were:-</p>

Even if her shop is safe from Compulsory Purchase, I wonder how all the disruption will affect her trading.

Her evidence was to the effect that she had been drawing too much from her business to fund lifestyle and costs. I accept this evidence &#8211; in fact, I am sure that she is right about this as the net assets have declined very substantially. She has sought it make additional profits by buying on lower margins and discounting stock but she does not feel that, in the long term, this makes good business sense.

She saved the farm for Mr and Mrs H - she would fight for them and her family if that is what was needed. All these are laudable qualities but they have coloured her approach to this litigation. Hence the fact that much of her evidence about M P seemed to me to be incorrect because she has convinced herself of the righteousness of her cause.

The effect of this is to the benefit of the Husband by some &#163;24,000 because it will reduce his ultimate liability by that amount as 50% of the properties values will be rebased for CGT purposes. In all the circumstances &#8211; because his pension is somewhat lower and because his business is prima facie worth less, I deem this slight advantage to be fair in all circumstances of this case.  I note that in his final presentation Mr Brudenell on behalf of the Husband indicated that there would be no CGT on M P farm on its reduced value. Of course, it may be that the Revenue will deem that transfer to be at market value in which event the Husband will have to pay CGT &#8211; if this does occur then there will be no advantage in net terms as set out above. If this does occur then, I still consider that the overall outcome is fair. If it is of any assistance I find as a fact that the true value of the property &#8211; subject to Mr and Mrs H&#8217;s rights &#8211; must be discounted because it could not be sold on the open market. Its value is thus some &#163;204,500. </span></p>
