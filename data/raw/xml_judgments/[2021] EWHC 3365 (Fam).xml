	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This is an application made by two journalists, Louise Tickle and Brian Farmer, for the publication of a fact finding judgment (&#8216;the Judgment&#8217;) given by HHJ Williscroft (&#8216;the Judge&#8217;) at Derby Family Court on 27 November 2020 in what, they argue, is a case of considerable public interest. The Judgment contains very serious findings of domestic abuse against the Father. The dispute before me was as to which parts of the Judgment should be redacted, in particular whether the identity of the parents should be disclosed. The application raises fairly stark issues of the balance between Article 8 and Article 10 European Convention Human Rights (&#8216;ECHR&#8217;) rights. As will become clear from what I set out below, I have found in favour of the Applicants and therefore will refer to the identity of the parents, as relevant, in this judgment. I will refer to the Child as X throughout and use the masculine as a neutral gender for grammatical convenience. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The position before me was that the Applicants argued for publication of the Judgment including the names of the Mother and Father but without the name of X, other wider family members and some of the most intimate details. That application and form of redaction was supported by the Mother and the Children&#8217;s Guardian. The Father did not oppose publication in principle, but argued for the redaction of the names of the parties and any parts of the Judgment which could lead to the identification of X. The Father, by the time of the hearing, did not oppose the inclusion of the intimate details the other parties wished to redact, but he did not positively argue for those to be published. The Father had however, in his third skeleton argument, argued that the Judgment should be published &#8220;warts and all&#8221; in relation to the intimate details, but keeping the parties and X anonymous. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The parents were married in 2007. X was born in 2018. The Father was elected an MP in May 2010 and was a Government Minister for a period between January 2018 and July 2018. The Mother was elected an MP in 2019 for the same constituency and remains an MP. A large part of the asserted public interest in the publication of the Judgment, and certainly in the naming of the parents, lies in the fact that the Father was an MP and a Minister. It is apparent from these facts that if the Judgment is redacted in such a way as to effectively protect the anonymity of X, a significant part of the public interest in the Judgment will be removed. The facts of the case are unusual in the sense that the parties are identifiable even without their names by the shortest of internet searches.</p>

The Court may itself publish information in the form of a judgment, which will commonly be anonymised so as to protect the identity of the child. The President of the Family Division produced Guidance in 2014 and 2018 relating to the publication of judgments. The 2014 Guidance at paragraph 16 and Schedule 1 indicates that judgments in cases such as this, fact finding at which serious allegations have been determined, should ordinarily be published on the grounds of public interest, subject to anonymisation. It is a matter of public record, and some public concern, that, despite this Guidance, relatively few judgments are published, and that number has been falling. It is therefore uncontentious that the Judgment should be published; the issue is the form of any redactions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is not my intention to summarise the Judgment as the purpose of this application is to allow the Judgment itself to be published. There is a schedule of allegations annexed to the Judgment which sets out the Judge&#8217;s findings. The Judge found that the Father had been physically abusive to the Mother on more than one occasion. He was also physically abusive to a female family member on more than one occasion. The Judge found that the Father had used coercive and controlling behaviour, including to pressurise the Mother to engage in sexual activity. The Judge found that the Father raped the Mother by inserting his penis into her when she was asleep on more than one occasion. The Judge at J6.45 refers to the issue of submission and consent being a complex one, and I am fully aware of the complicated relationship between rape as a criminal offence and the more generalised use of the word. In the context of the Judgment, it is perfectly appropriate for the Judge to have used the language she did, see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H-N and others (children) (domestic abuse: findings of fact hearings)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2021/448" isNeutral="true" canonical="[2021] EWCA Civ 448" court="EWCA-Civil" year="2021" jurisdiction="GB" type="case">[2021] EWCA Civ 448</ref> at [72].</p>

 <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;17..The interplay between articles 8 and 10 has been illuminated by the opinions in the House of Lords in Campbell v MGN Ltd <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2004/22" isNeutral="false" canonical="[2004] 2 WLR 1232" reportSeries="wlr" court="UKHL" neutral="[2004] UKHL 22" year="2004" jurisdiction="GB" type="case">[2004] 2 WLR 1232</ref> . For present purposes the decision of the House on the facts of Campbell and the differences between the majority and the minority are not material. What does, however, emerge clearly from the opinions are four propositions. First, neither article has as such precedence over the other. Secondly, where the values under the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each. For convenience I will call this the ultimate balancing test. This is how I will approach the present case.&#8221;</span>

 <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;148. What was the nature of the freedom of expression which was being asserted on the other side? There are undoubtedly different types of speech, just as there are different types of private information, some of which are more deserving of protection in a democratic society than others. Top of the list is political speech. The free exchange of information and ideas on matters relevant to the organisation of the economic, social and political life of the country is crucial to any democracy. Without this, it can scarcely be called a democracy at all. This includes revealing information about public figures, especially those in elective office, which would otherwise be private but is relevant to their participation in public life. Intellectual and educational speech and expression are also important in a democracy, not least because they enable the development of individuals' potential to play a full part in society and in our democratic life. Artistic speech and expression is important for similar reasons, in fostering both individual originality and creativity and the free-thinking and dynamic society we so much value. No doubt there are other kinds of speech and expression for which similar claims can be made.&#8221;</span>

As such, it is a relatively unusual example of a case which would engender public attention where there is no criticism of the Judge but rather contains a careful consideration of these issues. Most cases involving private family law litigation and allegations of domestic abuse, where the judgments are eventually published, are ones which are appealed (to the High Court or the Court of Appeal) and it is therefore being argued that the Judge has erred. In this case the Mother, the Applicants and Rights of Women all say that the Judge approached the determination of allegations of domestic abuse in an appropriate and sensitive manner. </p>

It would appear to the public to be highly inconsistent, and difficult to justify, to allow the perpetrator, namely the Father, anonymity in the Family Courts.

She argues that the Father&#8217;s stance in this case is a continued effort to silence and control her through who she can speak to about the case and the narrative that she can give. As such, Dr Proudman argues that the Mother&#8217;s Article 10 and Article 8 rights are being interfered with by preventing the Judgment being published and her being able to speak about her experiences. She argues that the very fact of the Father&#8217;s resistance to publication of the Judgment is yet another example of his coercive and controlling behaviour. </p>

The Mother is clear that she can manage any media interest in a way which protects X, both now and in the future. Ms Reed accepted that there are likely to be problems for X in the future in relation to his relationship with the Father, given what is already in the public domain, and the issues in the Judgment. But those problems are not primarily a consequence of publication of the Judgment, but rather of the Father&#8217;s behaviour and the fact that some of that is already publicly known.

If the parts relating to the parents being MPs, and what happened in 2018, are removed then that integrity is undermined because a core part of the facts would be missed out.

 <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;35. Article 8 thus protects two very different kinds of private life both the private life lived privately and kept hidden from the outside world and also the private life lived in company with other human beings and shared with the outside world. For, as the Strasbourg jurisprudence recognises, the ability to lead one's own personal life as one chooses, the ability to develop one's personality, indeed one's very psychological and moral integrity, are dependent upon being able to interact and develop relationships with other human beings and with the world at large. And central to one's psychological and moral integrity, to one's feelings of self-worth, is the knowledge of one's childhood, development and history. So amongst the rights protected by Article 8 , as it seems to me, is the right, as a human being, to share with others &#8212; and, if one so chooses, with the world at large &#8212; one's own story, the story of one's childhood, development and history. Man is a sociable being. Long ago Aristotle said that &#8220;He who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god&#8221;. More recently, Blackstone observed that, &#8220;Man was formed for society&#8221;. And, somewhat earlier, John Donne had memorably written that, &#8220;No man is an Island &#8230; any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind&#8221;. That is what distinguishes mankind from the brute creation. We are able to think and to communicate with each other. We have self-awareness. It is natural for us to want to talk to others about ourselves and about our lives. It is fundamental to our human condition, to our dignity as human beings, that we should be able to do so. This, after all, is why totalitarian regimes seek to silence those who will not conform not merely by taking away their right to speak in public but also by depriving them of human companionship. </span>

The personal autonomy protected by Article 8 embraces the right to decide who is to be within the &#8220;inner circle&#8221;, the right to decide whether that which is private should remain private or whether it should be shared with others. Article 8 thus embraces both the right to maintain one's privacy and, if this is what one prefers, not merely the right to waive that privacy but also the right to share what would otherwise be private with others or, indeed, with the world at large. So the right to communicate one's story to one's fellow beings is protected not merely by Article 10 but also by Article 8 .&#8221;</span>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It follows from <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re S</span> that neither the asserted Article 8 nor Article 10 rights take precedence. By the end of the hearing Mr Clayton accepted that <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re S</span> did set out the relevant approach in this case, and in my view that is plainly correct. The Court must undertake an intensive analysis of the specific rights being claimed and then carry out the balancing exercise. In my view there is no inconsistency between undertaking the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re S</span> balancing exercise and applying the principles in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">FZ</span> at [10]. The child&#8217;s best interests are plainly <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">a</span> primary consideration, which I have to carefully consider on the specific facts, but not <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">the</span> primary consideration. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I start with Article 10. It is a trite but none the less central principle that open justice is of vital importance to a democratic society and a properly functioning judicial system. Any infringement of that principle needs to be carefully justified. The Applicants&#8217; rights under Article 10 are in effect held to protect the public interest in knowledge of what happens in the Court system. I accept that, on the specific facts of this case, there is considerable and legitimate public interest in the publication of the Judgment including the parties being identified. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The Father was in a prominent and powerful position in the UK. Importantly, his role as an MP and a Minister meant that he had a role in law-making, including in respect of issues concerning domestic abuse. The mere fact that he was an MP, let alone a Minister, means that there is a strong public interest in the public knowing about a finding by a Judge of conduct of the nature of that set out in the Judgment. The democratic system relies upon the media being able to publish information about elected representatives, particularly where the information comes from findings in a court judgment. Of course, the public&#8217;s right to such information is not without limit and politicians retain Article 8 rights. However, I note that the Father does not rely on his own Article 8 rights, and if it were not for the interests of X there could be no doubt that the Judge&#8217;s findings would be published. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Further, the information that the Father put into the public domain after the sexting scandal is materially inconsistent with the findings in the Judgment. The Judge accepted that he had been sexting back in 2011. The Father had put himself forward in the Sunday Times article as having been the victim of a mental health crisis which led to him sending inappropriate texts in 2018. However, the Judge&#8217;s findings of rape and serious sexual misconduct pre-date any mental health crisis, as does the much earlier sexting. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In those circumstances there is a strong Article 10 right in the media being able to set the public record straight. There are considerable similarities in this regard to the reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Campbell</span>. However, in my view, the facts here are much more strongly in favour of publication than in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Campbell</span>, given the role of the Father as an MP, the fact that his earlier inconsistent and untrue statements were made to protect his political career, and the gravity of the facts that the Judge found. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I also consider that there is a broader public interest in the publication of the Judgment, including the identification of the parties. There is a well recorded concern that victims of domestic violence, and particularly women and girls, are often unwilling to come forward to the courts. The fact that Family Court proceedings almost always take place in private; that very few judgments are published; and that many of the judgments that are published are ones where something has gone wrong, all give rise to a public concern about the workings of the family justice system. There is very considerable publicity around judgments such as <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H-N,</span> but it is exceedingly rare for judgments to be published where there have been findings, not challenged on appeal, of domestic abuse, including coercive and controlling behaviour. As the parties other than the Father point out, this is a judgment where the Judge dealt with great care and sensitivity with issues of domestic abuse, and highly contested evidence. There is, in my view, a real benefit in a judgment such as this being brought to the public&#8217;s attention to show the workings of the Family Court in a transparent fashion. The Judgment could be published with names redacted but still containing the findings on domestic abuse. However, the truth is that it would in those circumstances receive little publicity. There is, in my view, an important Article 10 consideration in the public seeing a judgment such as this, where a powerful man is held to account in respect of abuse of his female partner. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The Mother&#8217;s Article 10 and 8 rights are somewhat different. She has a right under Article 10 to her own freedom of expression, and this includes the right to speak to whomsoever she pleases about her experiences. That Article 10 right would normally be very significantly interfered with by the privacy requirements of the Family Courts, but this would generally be justified under Article 10(2) by reason of the interests of the child. I also accept that her Article 8 rights to tell her own story and thus have autonomy, as explained by Munby J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re Roddy</span>, would be interfered with. The level of the interference in the Mother&#8217;s rights should not be underestimated. The Mother says that she feels that, having been subject to coercive control by the Father, she is now being silenced by his resistance to the Judgment being published. For women who have been the subject of domestic abuse to be unable to speak about their experiences, including their experiences through litigation, must often be extremely distressing. And may in some cases be re-traumatising. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The Mother suggested that, if the court refused to allow publication, she would refer to, or even read out, the Judgment in Parliament relying on Article 9 of the Bill of Rights. In my view this issue is irrelevant. Firstly, the Court cannot prevent or supervise what the Mother as an MP does in Parliament. That is a matter for the Speaker of the House and the Parliamentary authorities. The Father disputes that the Speaker would allow her to use Parliamentary Privilege in this way, but it would be wrong for me to speculate upon that. Secondly, the Mother has acted at all times as a responsible parent who prioritises X&#8217;s interests. I am confident that if I found it would be contrary to X&#8217;s interests for the Judgment to be published, she would think very carefully before saying anything in Parliament. Thirdly, I have to strike a balance under the ECHR; what the Mother does in Parliament is outside that balance. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In most cases the interference in parents&#8217; Article 10 rights is likely to be justified by the need to protect the anonymity of the child. It will usually be the case that the need to protect the child will be an overwhelming (although not paramount) factor. But the Court should be slow in all cases to be used as a means by which one parent seeks further control over the other. Particularly where there have already been findings of coercive control. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Further, there is a significant public interest in issues concerning domestic abuse and how it is dealt within the Family Courts being openly discussed and debated in as fully informed way as possible. This case is a very unusual one by the very fact that the survivor of the abuse, the Mother, and the Child&#8217;s Guardian, support publication. It is also unusual in that those who seek to achieve publication wish to use it as an example of good handling by the Family Court. The nature of the way judgments in private law cases in the Family Court are published means that usually only those cases where something is alleged to have gone wrong are published. This leads to an inevitable erosion of public confidence in the family justice system, both in private and public law (care) cases. This lack of confidence is ultimately hugely detrimental to the public interest, both in the upholding of justice and the protection of children. This case offers an opportunity to slightly redress that issue. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">All these factors have to be weighed against the Child&#8217;s Article 8 rights. These are not paramount, see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re S</span>, but they are of very great importance. If X was older and was likely to be on social media and watching any media/social media interest which follows from publication, I would be very concerned about publication. I fully accept that both children and other parents can be both intrusive and at times unpleasant, and a somewhat older child could be placed in a very vulnerable situation. However, X is only 3 and has no access to social media and will not have for some little time. To the degree that parents or children at nursery make any comment to X it is likely to totally pass him by, given his young age. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It may be that there will continue to be some media interest in years to come, and things said on the internet do frequently remain in perpetuity. However, firstly the likelihood is that the media storm, if there is one, will pass fairly quickly. Secondly, explanations are going to have to be given to X in any event, at an age appropriate time, given the sexting scandal and constraints over his contact with his Father. I am therefore as confident as I can be that X will be protected from the ramifications of the publication of the Judgment.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Finally, there is the issue of the impact of publication on X&#8217;s relationship with the Father. Again, in my view, this can be appropriately controlled. Contact with the Father is currently significantly circumscribed given the nature of the findings, and the Judge will consider contact further later in the proceedings. The findings will have a very material impact on X&#8217;s contact with the Father, and doubtless with their on-going relationship. However, that is not a product of publication, but rather of the Father&#8217;s behaviour as found by the Judge. Given X&#8217;s young age, and likely obliviousness to the fact of the Judgment itself, I find it difficult to see how the publication of the Judgment will make any greater impact on the relationship. There may be a short-term media storm, but as I have said above, in my view X can be protected from that. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Therefore having carried out the intensive and fact specific investigation of the different ECHR Articles in play, I have concluded that the Judgment should be published with the Mother and Father&#8217;s names and in accordance with the redactions proposed by the Applicants and supported by the Mother and Guardian. </p>
