	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Defendant is a young adult who has suffered from severe schizophrenia for some considerable time. She was admitted to hospital in September 2002 pursuant to the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.  Upon admission it was discovered that she was pregnant.  She was at the time aged just 18.  The Defendant&#8217;s treating doctors formed the view that a termination of the pregnancy was necessary to prevent grave permanent injury to her physical or mental health.  Her treating psychiatrist, Dr S, together with the consultant gynaecologist, Mr C, signed a certification pursuant to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/87" uk:canonical="1967 c. 87" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Abortion Act 1967</ref> to that effect.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I further found that the proposed procedure was in the Defendant&#8217;s best interests as the risks attendant upon the Defendant&#8217;s pregnancy continuing to full term were very significant and far outweighed the risks attendant on the termination.  Accordingly, I granted the declaration sought by the Claimant (see [2002] EWHC (Fam) 3189).</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">During the course of the application an issue was raised as to whether, in any event and in the light of existing case law, it had been necessary for the Claimant to have sought a declaration from the Court at all.  In relation to the instant application, particularly in light of the initial lack of consensus amongst the parties and medical experts, I was in no doubt that it had been proper for the Trust to make the application.  However, prompted by the parties (the health trust and the official solicitor) who were concerned that the situation might now be different in the light of the &#8220;Human Rights&#8221; legislation, I indicated that I would be prepared to hear further submissions on this wider issue should the parties, on reflection, wish to obtain guidance in relation to it.</p>

Lord Brandon said at 56:</p>
	      <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>

		    <content>
		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;The application of the principle which I have described means that the lawfulness of a doctor operating on, or giving other treatment to, an adult patient disabled from giving consent, will depend not on any approval or sanction of a court, but on the question whether the operation or other treatment is in the best interests of the patient concerned. That is, from a practical point of view, just as well, for, if every operation to be performed, or other treatment to be given, required the approval or sanction of the court, the whole process of medical care for such patients would grind to a halt.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="BodyTextIndent3" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst a declaration of the court was not necessary to establish the lawfulness of the proposed treatment, there were however certain circumstances in which good practice would nonetheless require it. The speech of Lord Brandon (at 56) set out the parameters thus:</p>
	      <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;That question is whether, in the case of an operation for the sterilisation of an adult woman of child-bearing age, who is mentally disabled from giving or refusing her consent to it, although involvement of the court is not strictly necessary as a matter of law, it is nevertheless highly desirable as a matter of good practice. In considering that question, it is necessary to have regard to the special features of such an operation. These features are: first, the operation will in most cases be irreversible; secondly, by reason of the general irreversibility of the operation, the almost certain result of it will be to deprive the woman concerned of what is widely, and as I think rightly, regarded as one of the fundamental rights of a woman, namely, the right to bear children; thirdly, the deprivation of that right gives rise to moral and emotional considerations to which many people attach great importance; fourthly, if the question whether the operation is in the best interests of the woman is left to be decided without the involvement of the court, there may be a greater risk of it being decided wrongly, or at least of it being thought to have been decided wrongly; fifthly, if there is no involvement of the court, there is a risk of the operation being carried out for improper reasons or with improper motives; and, sixthly, involvement of the court in the decision to operate, if that is the decision reached, should serve to protect the doctor or doctors who perform the operation, and any others who may be concerned in it, from subsequent adverse criticisms or claims.&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;Having regard to all these matters, I am clearly of the opinion that, although in the case of an operation of the kind under discussion involvement of the court is not strictly necessary as a matter of law, it is nevertheless highly desirable as a matter of good practice.  There may be cases of other special operations to which similar considerations would apply. I think it best, however, to leave such other cases to be examined as and when they arise.&#8221;</p>

(See the Law Commission&#8217;s report at page 87, and clause 8(3)(c) of the Draft Bill, <span style="font-style:italic">Mental Incapacity</span>, Law Com No 231).  Importantly, it was the Commission&#8217;s view that the procedures in the Abortion Act did not of themselves adequately protect young women lacking capacity, upon whom terminations were being performed without in all cases a proper investigation of their capacity.</p>

The issue of the termination of pregnancies in such circumstances must arise frequently. It seems to me essential that each hospital should have a protocol to deal with possible terminations of such pregnancies, and that these protocols should be designed to address the issue in good time so that, wherever practicable and in the interests of the patient, a termination can be carried out at the earliest opportunity. Furthermore, any such protocol should ensure that the patient is referred at an early stage to independent legal advice, whether from the Official Solicitor or the solicitor who, as in this case, appears to have represented her at the Mental Health Review Tribunal.&#8221;</p>

It is imperative that the medical profession ensures that adequate protocols are put in place for the timely resolution of these issues.   </p>
