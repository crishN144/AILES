They were resent to his new address, and on 13 November he contacted the court asking for an oral hearing. Mr Justice Coen directed that the matter be listed for an oral hearing and it was listed before me on 12 December. On that occasion, the appellant father did not attend and a message was received saying that he was sick. I adjourned the matter to 24 January and directed the appellant to provide the court with a medical note confirming his illness. No such certificate has been submitted. On 24 January 2019, the appellant father attended court but due to an error on the court&#8217;s behalf the case had not been listed. It was therefore further put over until 31 January. </p>

He made an impassioned plea and urged me to allow him a second chance to challenge the case against him telling me that he was now better prepared and able to conduct his challenge in a more effective way. He was courteous throughout albeit he was upset and he clearly feels he has not been properly heard or given a fair chance. His strength of feeling about the mother and other members of his family came through very clearly; he using similar terms to describe them to me to those he used before recorder Maynard. </p>

Recorder Maynard had first dealt with the case at the pre-trial review on 8 August 2018. By the time it came to the trial he had a bundle which approached some 1500 pages of documents much of which comprise local authority, police and medical disclosure. It is evident from the judgment that he devoted considerable time and effort to ensuring the issues were fully explored. He watch the ABE interviews (it appears not as part of the time estimate) on several occasions and read and re-read the key documents and the parties written submissions.

He paid very careful attention to the sexual abuse of S. Carefully analysed how the allegations came to be made, the evidence in support of them and in particular he carefully analysed the interview of S. He also looked at other material that was potentially corroborative. He identified matters which potentially undermined the veracity of S&#8217;s allegations; in particular where it was confusing. He identified that the father&#8217;s case was that S had in effect been sent into the interviews with a script of lies in order to discredit him. The judge was satisfied that S was cognitively not able to hold such a script and repeated. He found her demeanour and presentation were not consistent with this his very thorough analysis of this issue is illustrative of his approach to the allegations generally. It is a model of careful thorough and balanced evaluation taking account of the proper approach to such allegations. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.44in;margin-right:0.04in">The judge was clearly very much alive to the fact that the father was a litigant in person. In paragraph 67 and 68 he refers to the issue and how the judge had sought to ensure that the father had a fair hearing by allowing him the opportunity to put further documents for the court and to put questions on the father&#8217;s behalf to witnesses. In paragraphs 26 and 27, the judge records that he encouraged the Children&#8217;s Guardian to adopt an inquisitorial approach by cross-examining in order to test the allegations and that the Guardian adopted this approach. At paragraph 55, the judge records that the Guardian&#8217;s counsel had conducted a detailed and thorough cross examination of the mother which also covered many of the questions the appellant father wish to ask. Further questions were put by the judge on behalf of the father. Notwithstanding the father&#8217;s failure to avail himself of the opportunity to obtain complete copies of the trial bundle&#8217;s in advance of the PTR, the judge ensured he was given them at that stage and the judge allowed him to produce a further 150 pages of material on day one of the trial. The father called evidence from three witnesses. It is clear that Recorder Maynard gave the father the opportunity to bring further evidence to court which he did on the first day of the hearing and I cannot see that there is any case to show that the father was unable to put relevant material before the court because of his lack of legal representation. In particular there is nothing which suggests there was anything which was of such significance that it could have materially altered the overall evidential picture before the judge. The transcript makes clear that the father was well able to speak up for his position when he gave evidence and there is no evidence that any anxiety materially hampered his ability to present his case.</p>

He records that the father&#8217;s case is that the mother has fabricated these allegations and that it is part of a continuing history of the mother fabricating complaints. He records that the father&#8217;s case is that the children have been manipulated, and that contrary to the mother&#8217;s allegations, it was in fact she who was the aggressor. The judge notes that the evidence showed the mother had lied about various matters at various times [#84]. It appears from paragraph 90 that in April 2016 the father had implicitly accepted that he presented in aggressive way to others. In December 2016 the father pleaded guilty to an assault on a third party.  The judge sets out his conclusions on the credibility of the witnesses at some considerable length between paragraphs 118 -155. He looks at various components of the evidence. A significant part of the documentary evidence was the social services and police records and so the judge was well able to take into account the contents of those and the extent to which they supported either the father&#8217;s case or the mother&#8217;s case. There is no suggestion that he overlooked significant material which would have altered the evidential balance.  </p>

He also observed her demeanour in relation to the father. He also identifies that she was challenged about inconsistencies in her account and in particular paragraph 130 identified lies that the mother had told including a false allegation of rape. At paragraph 131, the judge applies the Lucas test and was satisfied that the lies told in other matters did not undermine the balance of her evidence. He concluded that the mother was a reliable witness on nearly every issue on which she gave evidence. He did identify an inconsistency between her ABE interview and an account provided to police in July 2017 and as a result of that inconsistency he did not make the findings that the mother sought in relation to sexual abuse allegedly perpetrated by the father upon the mother.  </p>

If the father loves his children as dearly as he told me he does, and if he truly wants the best for them, he must find the courage in himself to face the fact that he has behaved abusively towards his children and be able to make amends to them. The first step in that will be beginning to acknowledge and accept that he has behaved in ways which have harmed his children. </p>
