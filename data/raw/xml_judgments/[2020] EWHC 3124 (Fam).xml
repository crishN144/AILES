	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 23 October 2020 I gave judgment in this matter authorising the deprivation of G&#8217;s liberty in an unregulated placement. G is 16 years old.  The decision was published as <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire CC v G (Unavailability of Secure Accommodation) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2020/2828" uk:canonical="[2020] EWHC 2828 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWHC 2828 (Fam)</ref>.  At this hearing G remains represented by Mr Michael Jones of counsel, through her Children&#8217;s Guardian.  The local authority remains represented by Ms Louise Boardman of counsel. Whilst the local authority contended at the date of the last hearing, and continue to contend at this hearing, that G is in urgent need of a secure placement, and whilst the Children&#8217;s Guardian remains opposed to that course of action, favouring a regulated non-secure placement, it remains the case, nearly a month later, that no such placements of either type are available for G anywhere in the United Kingdom.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within this context, G has remained for nearly a month, and continues to remain, in an unregulated placement that is sub-optimal having regard to G&#8217;s highly complex welfare needs and that is not prepared to apply to Ofsted for registration.  Whilst G has remained relatively settled in that placement, recently there have been some worrying signs that this period of calm is fragile and will be temporary.   </p>

Once again, the Children&#8217;s Guardian remains unable to give her support to G being placed in this placement under the auspices of an order depriving G of her liberty, albeit that she recognises that this remains, in reality, the only option currently available for G.  Once again, the court is presented with the <span style="font-style:italic">fait accompli</span> that I described in my initial judgment, namely, the need to retain G in a placement that is sub-optimal in terms of G&#8217;s wider welfare needs because the alternative is discharging her into the community where she will, I remain satisfied on the evidence before the court, be at a very high risk of fatal self-harm.   </p>

In particular, it would not be appropriate for the court simply to give an open ended authorisation until such time as the local authority is able to locate a suitable placement (see the guidance issued by President of the Family Division entitled <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Guidance: Placements in unregistered children&#8217;s homes in England or unregistered care home services in Wales </span>at [1]).   </p>

These proceedings have now been before a Deputy High Court Judge on two occasions and before a Judge of the Division on four occasions, including this hearing.  Within this context, it is sobering to examine the cost to date, in both money and time, consequent upon the unavailability for G of a secure placement or regulated non-secure placement.  This is not in anyway to suggest that resources are being inappropriately deployed by those agencies concerned with G&#8217;s welfare, but rather to highlight the financial and wider resource consequences of the position reached in this case.
