She draws to my attention that given the applicants&#8217; ages there might be a suspicion that they were wanting to bring B here to help look after them, rather than them look after him.  She finds in her professional judgment that is not their motivation.  They want to be his parents and they have been trying to bring him here for some time because they want to raise him.  As she puts it: &#8216;my considered opinion is that [their] &#8230;motivation for adopting B and wanting to bring him to the UK is rooted in a genuine motivation to afford him a family life here with them.&#8217;  She concludes by telling me that their application is likely to be consistent with B&#8217;s wishes and feeling (a point made good by her two remote meetings with him) and his wider future best interests.</span></p>

Questions on each of those topics were put to each of the applicants and they gave good answers.  They would apply to the council for a larger flat, and if that was not successful they would move out of London to rent somewhere privately.  (They had some funds to allow them to do that.)  As to education, a friend of theirs was a teacher.  She was advising them what would be best. B was at the equivalent of the first year of his GCSEs.  If possible they would move him into a school allowing him to follow the same subjects.  If not, then he might be put back a year and start the GCSE course from the start here.</span></p>

Turning to the matters which might give rise to an exception: the circumstances of the adoption are ones which demonstrate generosity and kindness; the relationship between B and the applicants is one of geographically distant parents, his &#8216;biological parents&#8217; as I am told B said; and, though the needs of B and the capacity of the applicants to meet those needs is dramatically different from the &#8216;Hallmark&#8217; image of a small baby with young parents, with the advice of Ms Baker I am content with it.</span></p>
