	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This application, brought by Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust concerns a Mrs H. She is 71 years of age and lives with her daughter Miss T. I heard from her daughter Miss T during the course of evidence, and it is plain that she is an enormous source of support to her mother. </p>

The recommended treatment is surgical excision which will require a general anaesthetic and free skin flap<span style="font-style:italic"/>to cover the affected area. </p>

She noted that, in her view, the lesion looked suspicious of SCC and that Mrs H had no history of skin cancer. She emphasised in her recommendation and wrote in a separate paragraph, that Mrs H did have a past medical history of mental health issues including a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In the referral the GP included a succinct summary of Mrs H&#8217;s past medical history and her medications.  She specifically highlighted the diagnoses that Mrs H had received during the course of the previous decade and, in particular recorded that, in addition to the mixed Bipolar Affective Disorder, she had been admitted to hospital, pursuant to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>, in 2014 with a hypomanic episode, depressive symptoms, a history of poor engagement with services and a general lack of insight into her circumstances. The GP&#8217;s referral proved to be well founded, and her concerns were sadly confirmed by the diagnosis of SCC.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Mrs H is currently living at home with her daughter T, who, as I have said, cares for her. She has no history of dependence on drugs and alcohol. She has been known to local mental health services since 2014. She had a previous admission to a mental health unit<span style="font-style:italic"/>in 1974, following the tragic death of her daughter in a road traffic accident. Previously, she was aware that she was ill but considered she suffered a recurrent depressive disorder. When ill in the past, she had been depressed and was prone to self-neglect, but did not make any suicide attempts. In 2011, she was involved in distressing litigation concerning pension entitlements.  Her daughter told me that it was following the strain of this litigation that her mother&#8217;s health seemed to spiral downwards. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In 2014 Mrs H was admitted under the Mental Health Act, to two successive mental health units. She continued treatment under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>, until 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2014.  It was at that stage that she was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and treated with olanzapine and valproate. I have been told, convincingly, that whilst she was in hospital, she effectively deceived the medical establishment into believing she was taking her medication when in fact she was not. The discharge summary in the medical records describes paranoid and persecutory feelings. It is </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">plain that this period of detention in hospital had, in itself, a very negative effect on Mrs H and, it may in part, explain why, upon receiving her diagnosis, she refused effectively to engage with it. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Mrs H is described by virtually all who have encountered her but, most particularly by her daughter, as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">proud and stubborn&#8221;.</span> It is obvious that she can be very combative when confronted with beliefs which do not accord with her own.  It is an important feature of the case that initially, when the diagnosis was conveyed to Mrs H, she appeared to accept it; but my impression from the papers is that that was a deception, not dissimilar to her pretence that she had been taking her medication. She expressed that she would consent to surgery, she engaged with the options for reconstruction and, she expressed interest in the cosmetic result. But that was as far as it went. She did not attend the appointments made to carry out the surgery and, it seems likely that her mental health deteriorated.  She entirely rejected the diagnosis of cancer and she expressed herself to be of the strong view that a different doctor had told her the lesion on her face would resolve with the application of cream.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">She is a well presented, sharp, articulate, inquisitive and intelligent woman.  All agree on that. It does not, to my mind, follow automatically that having articulated an alternative diagnosis, which could not in fact be rooted in the evidence and, in refusing to contemplate cancer, one can extrapolate from that that she lacked the capacity to weigh up and evaluate the options. As Mr Pollock, the consultant plastic surgeon who gave evidence before me, observed, people react to such diagnoses in a wide variety of ways. But, as time has progressed it is clear that Mrs H is frequently agitated and unsettled. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It was not until the end of last year, more than a year on from the original referral, that proactive steps were made to secure the treatment for Mrs H that she so obviously required. She had in <span style="font-weight:bold">May 2019</span> been assessed as <span style="font-weight:bold">lacking the capacity to make decisions in relation to her medical treatment</span>, but it was not until 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019 that an application was made to this Court actively to address her carcinoma. I do not doubt that all those involved in her care have been concerned to do the right thing for her, but it requires to be confronted that the delay in this case may mean that a life is lost that could well have been saved.  That is quite simply a tragedy. It is also profoundly troubling. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">A particularly distressing feature of the chronology is that, following the proactive intervention of Mr Pollock at the end of last year, the growth began to increase very significantly. It is now covering most of the left cheek. It is unsightly; it is protuberant; it is painful; as Mrs H&#8217;s daughter describes, it is malodourous. She told me how her mother cannot now go out of the house because she is embarrassed by the unsightliness of the growth. She now stays inside all day. It is necessary to put the fire on because Mrs H is cold. Her daughter explained how the warm house intensifies the smell to the extent that, on occasions, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;it causes her to gag&#8221;</span>. She tells me how her mother can no longer put in her dentures, cannot enjoy food and must drink through a straw; how she cannot lie down comfortably at night or sit in a chair; how the reactive depression to her circumstances has led her to become agitated and, talk to herself frequently throughout the watches of the night. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">often characterises the evidence of relatives who feel that those they have loved, have not been given the treatment they were entitled to.  In her simple and unembroidered account of how her mother talks to herself and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;hears voices&#8221;</span>, as Miss T puts it, she was able to help me unify the capacity assessments with her direct lay observations and arrive, with very little difficulty, at the conclusion that this is a woman who is simply unable to absorb and accept the diagnosis she has been given. T tells me that her mother&#8217;s rambling monologues, throughout the night, are frequently a verbalisation of her emotional struggle to accept the diagnosis.  In my judgment, it follows from all this that Mrs H is unable to weigh and evaluate the treatment options. That includes not only the potential for curative treatment but the palliative options too. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">One of the reasons that treatment was not progressed more effectively was that the treating clinicians were perplexed as to whether it was appropriate and if so in what circumstances for Mrs H effectively to be forced, physically and by coercion if necessary, to attend for her treatment and, if so, how that might be achieved.  The reality, in my assessment of the chronology, is that this issue had been identified very clearly by April or, at the latest, May of 2019, and certainly following the capacity assessment on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2019. I have now, in a number of judgments, emphasised that whilst avoidance of delay is not incorporated into the framework of the Mental Capacity Act in specific terms, it is to be read into <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref> as a facet of Article 6 and Article 8. It is self-evident and, indeed, striking, that time here was of the essence and delay was likely to be inimical to Mrs H&#8217;s welfare.  Not only inimical but as it has transpired, potentially fatal. In <span style="font-weight:bold">London Borough of Southwark v NP &amp; Ors</span><span/><span style="font-weight:bold"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2019/48" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCOP 48" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCOP 48</ref> </span>I made the following observations which it seems to me require, once again, to be emphasised: </p>

She has not, for the reasons I have referred to, taken on board the scope and ambit of the diagnosis, but what is clear is that she finds this awful growth unsightly and, I sense, rather demeaning. She is also tired, which her daughter told me is often a precursor to deterioration of her mental health more generally. The growth has now very significantly, for all the reasons I set out, impacted on Mrs H&#8217;s quality of life, which is desperately diminished.  This combination of her tiredness, the unsightliness of her growth and the trust she has been able to place in Mr Pollock, has enabled a shift in her position. She now welcomes the treatment. That is not to say that she understands it, she is now prepared to engage with it, to remove the discomfort. It reflects her aspiration to be more comfortable. Sadly, it has to be recognised, as Mr Pollock did, that there is a real risk that intervention at this stage may now be too late. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">There are a number of options. Firstly, there is the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;no treatment option&#8221;</span>. If this is pursued, then I am told the SCC will continue to spread and develop into a fungating lesion, if that has not already happened. Mr Pollock stated there is evidence of macroscopic spread to the lymph nodes on her CT scan on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2019, which offers a worse prognosis but is still potentially operable and curable. However, if this were left untreated, it would prove fatal. Mr Pollock also stated that there is the risk of distant metastatic disease, but this may not yet be visible on the CT scan performed. This risk can be better assessed following removal of the lymph nodes during surgery. Given the size of the growth in the photograph of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2020, and the presence of lymph node spread, Mr Pollock considers that if left untreated then life expectancy is unlikely to exceed nine months, and may be as little as three months.  Involved in that process is an awful progression of disease which requires properly and candidly to be confronted.  It would inevitably be painful and distressing; the pain would be neuropathic in nature, and as such, not easily receptive to pain relief, though there could be options for analgesia, including both opiate based substances and specific agents targeted at neuropathic pain. There would be wasting.  The tumour could erode into the facial structure, with the risk of a burst blood vessel causing rapid exsanguination, or the development of prolonged pain where the nerves are involved. </p>

He told me that treatment delivery would involve 5 days a week: that having regard to the history of Mrs H, would be a challenge.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The only viable option identified is surgical excision. The growth seen in December, and shown on the first of the two relevant photographs, emanated or protruded from an area below the eye, but expanded in what Mr Pollock describes as a balloon shape, so that the extended part of the growth occluded the lower part of the orbit of the left eye. If we are lucky, it may not be attached. If we are unlucky, it probably means, as I understand the evidence, that surgical excision is not a viable option. It will not be viable in those circumstances because the reconstruction process to address the wound in the face would require the identification of skin qualitatively strong enough and <span style="font-style:italic"/>free from macroscopic tumour to make this effective. That would necessitate, in the eventuality that I have just described, a removal of the left eye. Mr Pollock observes that whilst nobody has elected for the no treatment option in these circumstances, he has encountered patients who are not prepared to accept the removal of an eye. This is not merely a refusal to contemplate further disability or disfigurement, but intrinsic to the removal of the eye is the reality that this represents an extension of the disease that is so advanced, that extensive incurable nerve involvement is highly likely. </p>

One is that there could be palliative radiotherapy. This involves a process which is not as protracted as curative radiotherapy. It is capable of being, what Mr Pollock has described as, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;fractionalized&#8217;</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">or &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">hypofractionated&#8217;</span>. By this he means there can be much greater doses of radiotherapy which are given in a reduced number of treatments, because they are palliative rather than potentially curative, are not required to be as deep, and are in essence cosmetic and symptomatic; as such they will not require radiotherapy with anything like the frequency of the curative regime. </p>
