The subject children are a boy who I will call D (not his true initial) who is 17 years of age and a girl, E (again, not her real initial), who is nearly 9 years old. Their parents separated as long ago as July 2019. Their marriage ended in a divorce, decree absolute being granted on 24 September 2019. The family finance proceedings were concluded in November 2022.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The proceedings before me are, on any view, old. In the bundle prepared for this hearing, the mother&#8217;s earliest application is dated 14 October 2019. At the time, the children were living with their mother. She sought that their time with their father should be supervised. On the face of the application, the mother made allegations that the father was manipulating the children and trying to undermine her parenting. She alleged that that was having a detrimental effect on the children&#8217;s psychological well-being and their behaviours. I reminded myself that at the time of the mother&#8217;s application, D would have been 12 years old and E, 4 years old.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The orders made within the application begin with the First Hearing Dispute Resolution Appointment on 13 January 2020. I shall only mention within this judgment the orders pertinent to the issues I need to determine. Within that context I note that the order of 13 January 2020 provided for the father to have contact with the children each Saturday for at least 6 hours provided that contact was supervised by an Independent Social Worker (&#8220;ISW&#8221;). Over the months that followed, the days and times for contact changed but direct contact supervised by an ISW continued in some fashion although it was suspended on occasion. In particular, by the March 2020 lockdown and by court order in 2021.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Deputy District Judge who heard the case on 13 January 2020, gave directions for a fact-finding hearing in the summer of 2020. However, that timetable could not be followed, primarily because of difficulties with obtaining disclosure from the police in relation to a parallel complaint the mother had made about the father. In addition, the local authority failed to follow court orders and the father says the mother kept asking for further time to finalise her statement. In July 2021, there was a hearing which was abandoned after the evidence had started. Contact between the father and the children was suspended at that time on the basis that the social worker had advised the court that the children needed a safe space with their therapist. This court has a letter from the therapist. That was not her advice. She advised that therapy would be offered whatever contact was in place and that the court should decide the issue of contact in accordance with the children&#8217;s best interests. Contact was restarted on a supervised basis.</p>

By that time, the issues between the parties had widened and each party made allegations against the other. The father did not have contact with D or E after this hearing.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">The mother seemed exhausted and broken by this case and (understandably) by the content of some of the allegations she had to describe and answer questions about.

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">She found that the mother&#8217;s recollection and perception of certain events involving the children had been heavily influenced by the father&#8217;s behaviour towards her personally and by the effect of what the Recorder described as these distressing and protracted proceedings. The Recorder considered that the mother&#8217;s allegations about the father&#8217;s behaviour towards her were broadly accurate and truthful. However, the Recorder considered that the mother&#8217;s fear of the father had led her to make assumptions in other contexts which were born out of her fear of him, but which did not warrant the interpretation the mother gave to them; for example, allegations of inappropriate comments by the father about E. The Recorder rejected the allegation that the father posed a sexual risk to E or that he treated the children like toys. She did not find the allegation that he performed trust exercises with the children proved.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">The father could be domineering and controlling of the mother and his children at home and the dynamic between the father and the mother was one in which the father was capable of losing his temper in an explosive and frightening way on occasion if he did not get what he wanted or if the mother did not conform to the father&#8217;s expectations. The Recorder found that the father felt that the mother&#8217;s role as a wife included a duty to keep him happy and this is why he was so incredulous that she called the police on him in 2015. She found that when challenged the father can become aggressive. </p>

This would have had a particularly damaging emotional effect on the mother.</p>

That view was expressed with the best of intentions but was different from the mother&#8217;s view and her wish for pain relief. The Recorder found that the father and the paternal grandmother did put some pressure on the midwife to listen to them rather than the mother who by then was in distress from a traumatic birth. The Recorder found that the father, aided by his own mother on this occasion was domineering and overbearing and that that resulted in emotional distress. </p>

The father says a fully anonymized judgment was circulated by the court on 14 July 2022. On behalf of the father, on 25 July 2022 an application was made to the Family Court to restore the case to court. As of 25 July 2022, the position appears to have been that the parties had agreed draft directions but could not agree interim contact. The father&#8217;s position was that he sought the continuation of direct contact supervised by an ISW. The mother&#8217;s position was that she wished to await the view of the local authority social worker and the outcome of a family assessment before making any decision on interim contact. At that time, both children were living with her and open to the local authority as Children in Need. CAMHS remained involved although D did not fully participate in the assessment or therapy. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The case was next referred to the court by an application dated 29 August 2023 but actually issued on 9 October 2023 on behalf of the mother. Within the application, it is stated that the court office had not acted on the application issued over a year before. The mother sought directions and a final order regulating the contact and living arrangements. By the time of this application, the situation on the ground had changed.  The mother and the children went on holiday in late May 2023, returning home on 1 June 2023. Two days later, on his sixteenth birthday, D moved to live with his father.  His mother says he did so without discussing it with her. The father tells the court that D has told him that he kissed his mother goodbye and that she knew of D&#8217;s intentions to see his father on his sixteenth birthday. D had not intended to stay overnight with his father, but his mother began threatening D with the police and D became frightened. Accordingly, it is said D decided to stay with his father. It appears common ground between the parties that the then social worker had discussed with D how he could move to live with his father when he was 16 years old, if that is what he wanted. In her statement in support of the application, the mother sets out how on 14 June 2023, D asked for some clothes and his passport in a WhatsApp message. She says that D threatened to call the police if she did not give him his passport number. His mother did as he asked. The father says that D visited his mother to celebrate her birthday on 5 July and that he, E, and the mother went out for a meal. The mother simply tells me that D returned to her home on 5 and 12 July 2023. She says that on the second occasion he accused her of stealing his money and called the police. D alleges his mother stole &#163;1000 from him. His mother denies this and asserts that the father is behind this allegation. The mother details a third occasion when D returned home in September 2023. She says he tried to take items from her home. The police were called again.</p>

I gave directions for the filing of evidence from the parties and from the social worker allocated to the children by the borough in which they live and by the therapist working with E. In the interim, D continued to live with his father. D did not want to see his mother and I did not make any direction to force the situation. E remained living with her mother and continued to have no direct or indirect contact with her father. By then, that had been the situation on the ground since the findings made by Recorder Moys. </p>

I agreed to make final lives-with orders which reflected the parties&#8217; agreement. D and E and their parents have thus had certainty about where the children are to live since then. It is hoped that this would, at least, enable the children to settle.</p>

Even if the videos of the father with E were staged by him for evidential purposes, I do not detect E in any of the videos to be fearful or reticent in her relationship with her father. I take the view that whilst she may have been prompted to say what she did for evidential purpose, her observed interaction with her father to my mind demonstrates their relationship better than her spoken words. It appears to be a natural and unforced relationship. Of course, those videos are set in time. I remind myself of two factors when assessing them. Firstly, that time has moved on, and E now is said to express different views. Secondly, no-one ever takes videos of negative matters. They are but a snapshot of good times which must be weighed in the balance with all the evidence. </p>

On occasions in his evidence, I consider that his focus was very much on the errors that the social workers and the therapist made when working on this case, rather than on the future welfare of the children in the circumstances they now find themselves. I accept that the evidence given to the court in 2021 caused the court to pause the children&#8217;s contact with their father when there was no need to do so. I accept that the children and he were impacted by that suspension. I accept the father&#8217;s point that E may have been influenced by the suspension of contact at that time, and I will factor that in when making my decision. However, (1) this case does not turn on that finding alone and (2) there were points in his evidence, and again in his closing submissions, when he seemed distracted by getting to the bottom of whether it was the therapist&#8217;s advice or whether the social worker had got her advice wrong, to the detriment of considering issues more pertinent to his children&#8217;s welfare. </p>

D, who previously did not attend school for about 3 years, now attended school. D was catching up on his lost education and excelling at certain subjects.

He loves her and wants to be a father to her. E is alone with the mother and likely to be influenced by her. He asserts that the mother has said horrid things about him to E.  In any event, E is likely to pick up on her mother&#8217;s views even if they are not expressed directly to her. He would like E to spend every other weekend with him. He would like to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">flip</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"/>Christmas and New Year with the mother.  He could collect and return E to school. That way, the mother would not have to have contact with him. There should be no restrictions on D and E&#8217;s contact. They are siblings and need each other. They have a bond and have shared their lives and their experiences. He accepts that restoring contact between E and him will be a challenge, given the passage of time but he is convinced that once the ice is broken, the good memories will come back. In cross-examination he said that E had told D that she missed him and that she missed her father. He considers that E tells her mother that she does not want to see him because that is what her mother wants to hear, and she wishes to please her. He is fed up with the input of the local authority and CAMHS which he says has not been child focused and is destructive. However, he is willing to be assessed by an ISW. He told me that if E tells the ISW that she does not want to see him, he will respect that. Initially, he said he would not undergo a risk assessment but when Ms Markham KC returned to that issue later in her cross-examination, he said he would if that would assist contact restarting &#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I am all for risk assessment &#8211; voices of children to be heard</span>&#8221;. </p>

He trusts the mother with E and knows she loves E and will do the best she can for her. He has not interfered in any way with the mother&#8217;s care of E and decision-making for her in the last 4 years. He has not, he says, shown D any court documents.

She confirmed that the children had been open to the local authority since 2019. Since the fact-finding hearing in 2022, they had continued to be regarded by the local authority as children in need of intervention. The children have experienced a number of changes of social workers. The social worker, MT, had observed warm interactions between D and the mother. Since the fact-finding, the focus of the social work intervention had been on getting D back into education and helping the children navigate the separation of their parents. Over the course of the &#8220;Child in Need&#8221; plan, her impression was that the father has consistently raised concerns about previous social work interventions which placed restriction on his contact with the children and actually caused it to be suspended in 2021. In November 2022, the Team Manager met with the father to discuss his concern about social care involvement and the lack of progress with contact between him and the children. The hope had been to improve the working relationship.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">By February 2024, the plan was to close the Child in Need Plan for D. It being accepted by the local authority by then that his father was meeting his basic needs. In the future, it was the local authority&#8217;s view that D&#8217;s school should be the lead professional for D. In relation to E, E is to be provided with EMDR and life story work will be completed with her by a social worker to complement the therapeutic intervention. The social work evidence before me was that E needed help to understand why she was restricted in seeing her father and brother and give her meaningful insight into her experiences to date. She seems to be confused as to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">why things are the way they are</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>The plan presented to the court by the key worker at that date was that E should have tightly monitored contact, direct and indirect, with her father at a family centre by an ISW. When speaking to her key worker, E has said she feels &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">weird</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"/>when contacted by him and nervous about seeing him. The recommendation as of February 2024 was therefore that E&#8217;s voice should be championed, and she should be able to decide whether to speak to her father. Her wishes and feelings should be at the centre of adult decision-making. In terms of sibling contact, D wants to see his sister, but E has said she does not want to see him for fear of an incident occurring between them. The key worker&#8217;s recommendation was that if E wishes to see D, it should be in a community setting with clear rules and a safety plan in place. The problem with the recommendations I have just set out is that it appears to recommend supervised contact, but it is premised on E wanting contact, which at the moment she does not. Consequently, it appears to me to be a plan which if implemented would put additional pressure on E to champion one or other of her parents&#8217; views.</p>

The cross-examination concentrated on the local authority failing to conduct any risk assessment before making their recommendations for contact. It also explored the local authority&#8217;s proposal to remove itself from D&#8217;s case and to leave any intervention to the school. Ms Markham posed the question - how would they manage the risk in contact between D and E? There was no real answer to that. She was then asked &#8211; what if D is enmeshed with the father, have you assessed that risk? Again, there was no substantive answer. It was put to the Team Manager that there needed to be a risk assessment and a proper safety plan in place before any contact could proceed between the siblings or E and her father. It was asserted that the local authority&#8217;s work lacked depth. The Team Manager accepted the need for a risk assessment in this case and that that was a necessary precursor to any work taking place. </p>

He queried why they had not asked D about the alleged incidents of violence towards his mother and why they relied solely on what the mother said about those incidents. He asserted through questioning that the voice of the children had not been heard and stated, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I am all for the risk assessment</span>&#8221;. He asserted through his questioning as a litigant in person that E had been a victim of the July 2021 order which had suspended contact on the erroneous advice of the then social worker. The Team Manager dealt with the cross-examination courteously and professionally. She accepted that the then social worker appears to have acted on the advice of the therapist resulting in contact being suspended in July 2021. She did not accept the father&#8217;s other criticisms.</p>

She caveated that answer by emphasising that contact was in a supervised setting. In her view, the father is competent in a controlled setting and navigates the evident sibling rivalry well.

She should have read the contact notes in full before entering the witness box; after all, this case centres around issues of contact. However, when given time to read, she did so diligently and re-entered the witness box to give a fair and reliable appraisal of the recordings which she placed in their context of their supervised setting.</p>

The therapist confirmed her agreement with them and with her colleague&#8217;s then assessments. The therapist's view was that D had been very confused living with his mother. He had split loyalties. He is likely to have been impacted by his father&#8217;s behaviours towards his mother. She wondered if he felt that the father was alone, abandoned and thus whether D felt guilty. She accepted that there was a conflict in D&#8217;s warm and loving relationship with his mother and then his violent outbursts towards her. Both children have been traumatized. In her view, D&#8217;s presentation could be trauma-based. She told me that D may find it easier to just cut off and accept his father&#8217;s mindset.  She is not significantly concerned for D at the moment, but trauma can re-surface at any point in the future.  She would like D to re-establish his relationship with his mother, but she does not know what support he would need.

However, because D was doing so well in his father&#8217;s care, her concerns were slightly diminished. She can see the benefits to E of having her father in her life - that should not be written off, but at the moment the risks that arise from the findings of fact and E&#8217;s current wishes and feelings mean that contact is not in E&#8217;s best interests.

The mother is clearly a victim of domestic abuse having suffered physically and sexually abusive behaviours as well as controlling and coercive behaviours within the definition of paragraph 2 of the Practice Direction. The children are, within the meaning of paragraph 3 of FPR 2010, PD12J the victims of that abuse.  On the basis of the findings, the father has been the perpetrator of that abuse. It thus seems to me to be appropriate that before proceeding any further, I should set out some of the salient paragraphs of FPR 2010 PD12J in this judgment.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The modern context in which King LJ considered <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> is set out in paragraphs 34-36 of her judgment. The modern legal landscape includes the advent of the smart phone and social media and the almost universal use of email as a means of instant communication. Another development considered of relevance by King LJ is the withdrawal of legal aid in the majority of private law cases leaving litigants unrepresented without the steadying influence of legal advisers. According to King LJ, one of the consequences of these changes not uncommonly seen in private law proceedings is that the other parties, and often the judge him or herself, can be (and often are) bombarded with emails from a parent, whether male or female, who is representing him or herself. Such behaviour may be the result of anxiety but in other cases, as in the case before King LJ, it is part of a campaign of behaviour by one parent against the other which amounts to a deeply disturbing form of oppressive behaviour on their part.</p>

It is her view, and one that I share, that to allow F to access health and educational information would inevitably lead to F finding out where the children and M were living. F has already demonstrated what he is likely to do once he has such information. I conclude, on the evidence and facts of this case, that to share information about the children's GP or schooling with F will not promote the children's welfare in any sense. Not only has F already shown how he would use the information to the detriment of the children and their mother, the pernicious effects on M, of the knowledge that F has information that may lead to F locating the family, are already apparent in the way that the family's lives are circumscribed. Any obligation on school or GP or local authority or agency to share information with F in the future would deeply affect and undermine the children's mother's ability to put down healthy roots in a community and establish a level of security and consistency in their schooling and in the provision of health services for the children, because of her well-founded fears. This conclusion concurs with the guardian's views and as she recommends, I shall make the orders sought.</span>&#8221;</p>

I reject the father&#8217;s allegations that the social workers in this case and the therapist are biased against him.  I have, in the papers before me and in the video clips the father has provided a number of snapshots of what E has thought at any particular time. I accept that she has previously said she wants contact. E&#8217;s view, like any other person, is impacted by the context in which she expresses it and by her understanding at that time. I factor into my assessment of what E has said most recently, that she is likely to have been influenced by the environment in which she lives. I do not consider it likely that those with whom she lives have deliberately set out to influence E and her views on contact. However, as I have already set out,  E used the word manipulated when speaking to the social worker without knowing what that word meant. I infer from that and consider it likely that she has picked up on adult conversations around her. She lives with her mother who is visibly distressed at the prospect of contact between E and her father, and E and D. E&#8217;s maternal aunt also lives with them. Although I have not heard from her, it would be human nature in a case such as this for the mother and her sister to discuss it terms which are negative of the father. They will not have done it knowingly, but E is in the household, and she is likely to have picked up on their views. Another professional speaking to E is likely to capture the same view for the simple reason E will, by agreement, continue to live with her mother because that is in her welfare interests. Any desire to please her mother or any indirect influence of E will not be diminished by a different professional speaking to E. The short point is that I have E&#8217;s view and I can decide what weight to attach to it and then proceed to weigh it in the balance, as I have just done, without an ISW speaking to E further.</p>

I find that if the ISW did not provide the evidence he seeks, he would, given past form, criticize the competence and independence of that professional. There would be no finality.

Her understanding will be coloured by her past lived experiences and the environment in which she lives. I have already found that she is likely to have been affected by what she has picked up in the environment in which she now lives.  I find that E does hold the view that she expressed in February 2024. I find, as the therapist told me, that E needs time and space to process all that has happened to her.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">The mother&#8217;s visible distress and anxiety in this case is real. It is not manufactured. I find that it is direct consequence of the father&#8217;s behaviours towards the mother about which Recorder Moys made findings.  The mother&#8217;s perception of the father is born of his treatment of her. It colours her view of contact between E and the father and D and E. I take it into account when deciding what weight to give to E&#8217;s views. However, I also factor in that it is agreed that E should live with her mother. I do so not because I rubber stamp the parties&#8217; agreement but because it is plainly in her best interests to do so. The father himself acknowledges that. He is right to do so. The mother and the home that E shares with her provides E with the stability and security she needs. That stability and security should not be undermined. However, it is not a perfect environment for E. It means that E will be living with her mother who is visibly impacted by the father&#8217;s past treatment of her and holds negative views about the father.</p>

He has never directly harmed E and there has been value in their past contact. I accept that for E to have no contact with her father means that she will not have the benefit of her interaction with him. That will be to expose her to a risk of emotional harm. That risk of harm is exacerbated by the mother&#8217;s negative view of the father to which contact with him would provide some balance. However, I also factor in the risk of harm to which E would be exposed if contact was promoted when she currently does not want it and when she lives with a mother so adamantly opposed to it. Promoting contact in those circumstances is to risk exposing E to increased conflict and stress when what she needs is a period of calm in which to process all that has happened to her and her family dynamics. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I also factor in the risk of emotional and psychological harm to E that emanates from the father. The father is dominant. He has his own way of doing things. His behaviour has, I find, impacted on D. The audio recordings that I have been asked to listen to by the father are, I find, strong evidence of the influence the father has had on D&#8217;s behaviour. Within those recordings D is dominant, demanding, and insistent with the professionals. He pursues the argument for the sake of pursuing the argument. As I listened to the recordings, I was struck by how D&#8217;s manner echoed that of his father. The recordings demonstrate the influence the father has and the effect it has had on D. I accept that if E is exposed to her father there is a very real risk that she too will come to echo her father in his interaction with professionals.</p>

Indeed, I factor in that since D has moved to live with his father, he has metamorphized. D has made significant changes to his physical health and is now excelling in education. I find that father has provided him with self-confidence and discipline. That has benefitted D and would benefit E if she had contact with him.  In many ways, but not all ways, the father is a very capable parent. </p>

When I conduct the balance on the facts as I find them to be, I agree with the therapist that it is not in E&#8217;s current best interests to have direct contact with her father. I consider that to promote direct contact with her father for E at the moment would be to put E even more prominently in the centre of the conflict between the mother and the father. I do not consider that to be in her best interests.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">The father has said to this court that the findings of Recorder Moys relate to historic matters. There have been no allegations about him for over 4 years. He has not sought the mother out and he has been respectful of her decision-making. He points to matters, set out in the opening note on his behalf, the matters which suggest the mother is not physically scared of him. However, I find that this is not a case about the mother being physically frightened of the father, it is a case of the mother being deeply impacted by his past behaviours on an emotional and psychological level. I do not use the word &#8216;traumatised&#8217; lightly. I have reminded myself that I am not a psychiatrist or psychologist and I have no evidence of that kind about the mother before me. However, from a lay perspective as I watched her give evidence and I watched her listening to the other evidence her distress was palpable. It was real and visceral. The descriptor &#8216;traumatised&#8217; is apt. Having to contemplate the father having contact with E provoked a significant reaction. In my view, ordering direct contact between E and her father could be safely managed from a physical perspective in that E could be collected and returned from her school without any parental contact. However, those type of arrangements cannot in my judgment ameliorate the deep-seated distress that the thought of contact between E and her father and the fear of how he will influence E has on her mother with whom she is to live. I consider that ordering direct contact in those circumstances is likely to destablise and undermine E&#8217;s relationship with her mother. That would not be in E&#8217;s best interests.</p>

However, the relationship between them can be maintained by the letterbox contact the mother proposes in her opening note, together with small gifts to mark her birthday and important religious festivals observed by the family. The expectation of this court is that the letters and cards will be monthly, and the mother will set up a PO box as she has volunteered to facilitate this indirect contact. Provided the content is appropriate, the mother shall make the letters, cards, and small gifts available to E. In addition, the school shall continue to send to him directly school reports redacted to remove any information that identifies the mother&#8217;s address or contact details. I find that the impact of the father&#8217;s past abusive behaviours on the mother is so great that the statutory agencies should not divulge her address to the father when corresponding with him. The mother intends to move, and I give the mother my permission to withhold her new address from the father.</p>

I consider that E needs a safe space in which to undertake that therapy and process her own thoughts and feelings. This continued litigation is undoubtedly impacting on the adult parties. Both are exhausted by it. What then, I ask myself must the impact be on the children at the centre of it. They will pick up on the anxieties the litigation provokes. In E&#8217;s case I consider it likely that she will be aware of and attuned to her mother&#8217;s heightened emotional state. Having read the evidence that the father has submitted in writing and his closing written submissions to this court, I take the view that the father will want to continue the fight if he does not get what he wants. When the father expresses himself in writing, he does so in a way which is negative of the mother, fails to demonstrate insight into the impact of his past behaviours on her and deflects from his own past behaviours by focusing, almost obsessively, on his conviction that the professionals are biased and incompetent. That triggers the mother and the cycle repeats. For the benefit of both D and E, I have decided that cycle must be ended.</p>

E is now 8 years old but will soon be 9 years old. I consider that a period of 2 years is proportionate to the risk of harm from which the order will protect her. That will give everyone respite from the litigation. It will provide E with the safe space she needs and will be in her welfare interests. Any application for permission to make an application made by the father during that period shall be first considered ex parte on the papers to avoid the potential of triggering the mother by any unmeritorious application that may be made.

On that basis, an order until E reaches majority appears to be sought. The problem with that is that the mother has a wholly negative view of the father. Whilst that is a consequence of the impact of his behaviours on her, it means that she is not best placed to judge where E&#8217;s best interests lie when it comes to decisions about E&#8217;s contact with her father. A period of two years for the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> provides the necessary protection from risk of harm that E needs without allowing for the possibility that in the future the risk may be diminish or E may be more resilient to it if it comes to fruition.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I have considered the application for prohibited steps orders/specific issue orders relating to the mother&#8217;s ability to make decisions about E&#8217;s health and education without consulting the father. I accept her point that the requirement to consult him about such issues puts the mother into direct contact with the father who has been found to have abused her. The impact of that on the mother and thus, its likely impact on E who lives with her mother cannot be underestimated. The father tells me he has never interfered with her decision making and would not do so now. The problem is that the father has, I find, no insight into his behaviours and their impact on others, particularly the mother.  I factor in the father&#8217;s past controlling and coercive behaviours towards the mother. Given his lack of insight into his behaviours on the mother, I find that without prohibition, there is a real possibility which needs to be guarded against that he will behave in a controlling and coercive way in the future towards the mother. Having heard the father give evidence, I agree that he acts as if he is superior to those around him and for whom he has no respect. If such behaviour did reoccur, I find that would be to E&#8217;s significant detriment. I therefore consider that it is in E&#8217;s welfare interests for orders to be made which limit the father&#8217;s parental responsibility in the terms summarised in paragraph 67 of this judgment. However, they too should be time-limited and should expire at the same time as the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> orders.</p>

I factor in that as siblings they will have a bond which will be informed by their lived experiences to date. Only they will know what they have experienced and how it has made them feel. They may, in the future, provide comfort to each other. However, I accept the evidence of the therapist that D is currently in his father&#8217;s world. Exposure of E to D is to indirectly bring her into contact with her father.  I have already balanced the benefits and detriments of such contact. The negatives, in my view, outweigh the positives.  It would bring the father indirectly into the mother&#8217;s world in which E lives. Added to all that, I factor in that at the moment E does not wish to see D. To force her to do so against her will is, in my view, likely to be harmful to her and actually potentially detrimental to the long-term prospects of re-establishing contact.</p>
