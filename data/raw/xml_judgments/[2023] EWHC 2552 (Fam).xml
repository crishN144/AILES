The case concerns care proceedings in respect of two children A aged 9 and B aged 4. On 9 July 2022 B incurred a very serious injury, whereby a 9cm knife entered her lower back and went through her abdomen and perforated her bowel. The fact finding hearing was concerned with how that injury occurred. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case has a complex procedural hearing. Both parents are English, but at the date of the injury the children and the Mother were living in Spain. In the aftermath of B&#8217;s injury the LA commenced s.31 Children Act proceedings and an issue immediately arose as to where the children were habitually resident. On 19 December 2022 I determined that they were habitually resident in Spain at the relevant date, see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Derbyshire County Council v Mother &amp; Ors</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2022/3405" uk:canonical="[2022] EWHC 3405 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWHC 3405 (Fam)</ref>. I also indicated that in my view the English court was the appropriate forum to determine any issues of fact. In summary, the children and the parents are UK citizens, the incident occurred in the UK, the parents (the only witnesses) speak English as their first language and all the clinical records and evidence is in English. It is manifest that England is a more appropriate forum than Spain. </p>

However, after discussion at that hearing the parties agreed threshold, and that a further fact finding process was not needed. For reasons that are explained by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Y and E (1996 Hague Convention: Article 11)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2023/817" uk:canonical="[2023] EWCA Civ 817" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EWCA Civ 817</ref>, Judge Williscroft&#8217;s order was then set aside by the Court of Appeal. There were two issues before that court, the jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter given the provisions of the Hague Convention and whether or not the Judge should have held a fact finding hearing. The Court of Appeal held that the Court should not have proceeded to the fact finding stage without a clear understanding of the Spanish authorities likely response to the Article 9 request. Further, the Court of Appeal found that the Judge had not properly considered whether a fact finding hearing was necessary. The order was set aside on both grounds. </p>

The concessions offered by the parents did not form a sufficiently clear factual basis on which the court could properly assess risk. The judge observed that, like others, she found it hard to accept neither parent had a physical memory of the incident, but she was &#8220;clear the court process was unlikely to provide more clarity.&#8221;  It seems, however, that the judge did not take into account the possibility that a continuation of the court process could lead to a finding that one or both of the parents were deliberately withholding information about the incident and that such a finding would be relevant to the assessment of risk. Furthermore, the judge stated in her judgment that &#8220;a clear narrative about what took place and whose responsibility it was has to be shared with the children and the whole family &#8211; an agreed narrative.&#8221; Yet with the ending of the care proceedings without any court order, the responsibility for creating the &#8220;clear narrative about what took place&#8221; rested with the parents alone. In the light of the parents&#8217; failure so far to provide any satisfactory explanation for what took place, there was no basis on which the court could have confidence that they would discharge that responsibility.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I also decided to hold a one day fact finding hearing, only to hear evidence from the parents. There is before me an expert report and addendum from Dr Haines, a forensic physician; and an expert report from Dr Smith, a forensic physician instructed by the police. I determined at the case management hearing that it was not necessary for me to hear oral evidence from either of these experts. As I explain below, Dr Haines&#8217; report and supplementary answers cover the nature of the injury, B&#8217;s likely response to the injury and the level of force that would be required, and Dr Smith on the distribution of blood and the tears to B&#8217;s clothes. However, in light of the fact that both parents deny inflicting the injury or seeing it inflicted, I did not consider that either hearing oral expert evidence, or instructing a further expert, would materially assist me in determining the key questions in the case.  I had in mind the President of the Family Division&#8217;s exhortation to &#8220;make cases smaller&#8221;. Having now heard the parents&#8217; oral evidence I am entirely fortified in my view that further forensic evidence, or cross examination of that evidence, would not have assisted me. </p>

In the light of this communication it was not necessary to consider further the Guardian&#8217;s application to adjourn the fact finding hearing, inter alia on the ground that no response had been received from the Spanish authorities. </p>

At the start of the hearing it emerged that the police have themselves now instructed a further expert. The police indicated that they did not wish to disclose the questions that had been put to this expert. However, the expert was described as a medical examiner. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have explained above, I had already determined that it was not &#8220;necessary&#8221; within the meaning of FPR 25 to instruct another expert. I was concerned that if the matter was adjourned until after the police expert reported, and any further interview of the parents was conducted, in practice the case would not even reach a fact finding stage until probably January 2024. That would then be 18 months after the proceedings commenced. In light of the fact that there were only two people in the pool of perpetrators and they both say that they do not know how the injury occurred; the expert evidence that is already before the court; and the fact that any expert evidence is exceedingly unlikely to reveal to the court which parent was primarily responsible for the knife finding its way into B&#8217;s abdomen, I took the view it was not proportionate or in the best interests of the children to adjourn for the outcome of further police investigations. </p>

So she denied &#8220;totally losing it&#8221; during the argument, but that was certainly the impression given by the Father, and the neighbours&#8217; evidence. She was keen to stress that the argument was dying down by the time she left the table. I felt this was because this would reduce the potential for a finding that she had been the person who injured B in her anger against the Father. She seemed to me to latch onto the possibility that A had not left the kitchen when the injury occurred, thus introducing another element of potential confusion in what happened, and again lessening any finding against her.</p>

He seemed to be saying he saw some movement, perhaps a &#8220;push&#8221; by the Mother, which by implication was of the knife.

Some lies, irrespective of how unpalatable they may be, will have absolutely nothing to do with the ultimate facts in issue of the case, save perhaps assisting the court with an analysis of the person&#8217;s general credibility. </p>

Ms Markham submits that the Mother panicked when she realised that B was bleeding heavily, and her failure to recall where B was is explicable in the context of that moment. She also relies on the Mother&#8217;s inability to cope with blood or her children being injured as being a reasonable explanation for why she did not look at the injury or immediately try to understand what had happened.</p>

He also relies on the fact that the Mother has accepted that she had become very angry, and at some points over the last year has accepted that she &#8220;lost it&#8221; during the argument. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I start with the factual and medical evidence. Dr Haines states that B was stabbed with the full length of a 9cm knife. Little strength would have been required for it to enter B&#8217;s abdomen. However, having read Dr Haines&#8217; evidence and the evidence of the parents, I find that the person who &#8220;propelled&#8221; the knife would have realised their actions were inappropriate and caused significant injury to B. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I find I can put no weight on what the parents tell me about how the injury occurred. In my view they are both deliberately lying and refusing to tell the truth. I am going to resist the temptation to speculate as to what might have happened. In my view further medical or forensic evidence will not help to resolve the question of who, and precisely how, the injury occurred. Even if there was firm evidence as to trajectory or force of the knife entry, that would not assist in deciding which parent was holding the knife at the key moment, or how they came to be in that situation. If the parents continue to refuse to tell the truth then no amount of forensic evidence will force them to do so, or will enable the court to determine what actually happened. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, I do consider, as Ms Briggs urges, that it is very important to be careful about the use of language in this case. The parents have referred to an &#8220;accident&#8221;. There is no evidence to suggest that either parent intended to injure B. However, this was not an &#8220;accident&#8221; in the true sense of the word. On the basis of the medical evidence, and all the other evidence, I am entirely confident that B did not accidentally injure herself in the sense of falling upon the knife. This makes neither forensic nor common sense in the light of the nature of the injury. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I find as a fact that A was not in the room when the injury occurred. Both parents seemed in the majority of their evidence, both written and oral, to say that A had gone upstairs. Most importantly A was clear in his police interview that he was upstairs. Sadly, I think that A is the most truthful member of this family. It was an ABE interview, although may not have met all the relevant guidance, and there are some parts of what A said which do not seem to be correct, in particular that he and the Father came back to the house twice. But A was very clear that he was upstairs and then was called downstairs when the parents decided to take B to hospital. If he had been in the kitchen when the injury occurred then that would have been very traumatic for him, and even more so if he had had some role in the injury. There has been no suggestion since that A has said anything different to anyone. As the Mother said, if A had had a role then it seems very unlikely he would not have said anything in the last 14 months. The neighbours&#8217; evidence suggest he might still have been in the kitchen, but the timeline from the neighbour&#8217;s evidence is impossible to establish. For all these reasons I find A was not in the room at the time the injury occurred.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The injury was a very severe one and is highly likely to have been immediately painful for B. On the basis of Dr Haines&#8217; evidence and common sense, B would have made a noise when the knife entered her abdomen. She was almost certainly crying or &#8220;moaning&#8221; as the Mother puts it, because of the argument that had been raging around her. But her tone would have changed, probably dramatically when the knife struck her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The kitchen/diner is not large and neither parent could have been more than a maximum of a few metres from B and from each other. To state the extremely obvious, knives do not fly and they do not propel themselves into children&#8217;s backs. I therefore find that one of the parents gave the force that propelled the knife into B. Whether that was by picking it up or by a glancing blow to the knife (although that seems unlikely), I cannot tell. That parent obviously knows they did that. I have fully taken into account everything that is said in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gestmin </span>and other cases about human memory. But however &#8220;in the moment&#8221; the parents were during their argument, the propulsion of a very sharp knife into their child&#8217;s back would have brought them out of that moment very quickly. This is not a case where there is any suggestion of excessive alcohol consumption or drug taking on that day which might have impacted on their memory.  So in my view at least one of the parents is lying to the court about their actions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Briggs asks that I make a finding as to whether the knife was held by one parent. It seems likely that this was the case, but I cannot rule out the possibility that the knife was inadvertently propelled by one parent in the course of the argument, rather than actually being held.  But contrary to Ms Briggs&#8217; view I do not think this is critical in respect of &#8220;risk&#8221;. The parents allowed a situation to develop where they were having such a heated row that somehow a very sharp knife found its way into B&#8217;s abdomen and they refuse to tell the truth about what happened. That creates an obvious risk, which is going to require some very careful work with the parents, to mitigate so that, I hope, the children can ultimately be safely placed with them. </p>

Even if that conclusion is wrong, the Mother&#8217;s story about not immediately asking the Father is also not believable. </p>

I do not accept Ms Markham&#8217;s submission that I should put more weight on the Mother&#8217;s evidence by reason of the fact that the Father has accepted he lied about the sofa. I do not think the Mother ever believed the sofa story. When the Mother picked B up she was bleeding heavily. The Mother says she picked B up either from the booster chair or the floor, so the idea that she was injured when bouncing earlier on the sofa is nothing short of ridiculous.</p>
