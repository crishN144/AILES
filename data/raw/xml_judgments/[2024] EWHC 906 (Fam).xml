	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am delivering this judgment because this case seems to me to illustrate some of the issues which are emerging in the Family Courts in relation to the use of intermediaries. An intermediary can be an essential component in what the court provides to a party or witness to enable them to participate fairly in proceedings or in giving their best evidence and my own experience demonstrates their value in appropriate cases. The issue however is where is it appropriate to direct the use of an intermediary as they are not  to be used as some sort of safety net or security blanket by lawyers or the courts but only where their use is necessary. Like other court funded resources (whether judicial or otherwise) they are a limited resource and a resource which comes with significant costs. Their use is governed by the procedural regime established in FPR 2010 r.3A and PD3AA. </p>

Whilst I do not think (albeit without hearing full argument) that the definition should necessarily be interpreted as meaning an intermediary can <span style="font-weight:bold">only</span> perform those functions it does give an indication of what their primary function is. Thus, assisting a party during a hearing to understand the evidence given by others or assisting a party to read papers and to give instructions is a function not identified in the rules and one which requires to be evidenced. Due to the nature of how this application was disposed of I did not hear full argument on the remit of an intermediary and it may well be that this will require more detailed consideration on another day. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Previous cases which described an intermediary as an expert have been superseded by the implementation of FPR3A. However there is still a forensic link between the regime which applies to the appointment of experts because the approach mandated by FPR 3A that the court must take to making a participation direction is whether it is <span style="font-weight:bold">&#8220;necessary to make the participation direction&#8221;: FPR 3A.2A(3) and 3A..4(1) and 3A.5(1)</span>.. In the context of the expert, Munby LJ said in Re H-L (Expert Evidence: Test for Permission) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 2 FLR 1434" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 2 FLR 1434</ref> that necessary falls: &#8220;somewhere between indispensable on the one hand and 'useful', 'reasonable' or 'desirable' on the other hand, having 'the connotation of the imperative, what is demanded rather than what is merely optional or reasonable or desirable. Whether that means that &#8216;nothing else will do&#8217; would require consideration of the other means by which fair participation can be achieved.  </p>

	    <num>10.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus, the test remains a strict one although what is necessary will bear some correlation to the measure proposed The necessity of a direction for a screen or a break is likely to be much easier to demonstrate than a direction for an intermediary. Ultimately the court is engaged in an evaluation of what participation directions are necessary to ensure that a &#8216;fair hearing&#8217; is achieved either in relation to a witness&#8217; evidence or to a party&#8217;s participation in the proceedings. The court will have regard to 3A.7(a)-(m) which includes many factors including whether the party or witness suffers from a mental disorder or otherwise has a significant impairment of intelligence or social functioning, the nature and extent of information before the court, whether a matter is contentious, any characteristic of the party or witness which is relevant, the measures available to the court and the cost. In the South Eastern Circuit (excluding London) the available figures show that HMCTS expenditure on intermediaries has increased from &#163;1.065m in 2019/20 to &#163;3.6m in the first 9 months of 2023/24. That is a considerable sum and the instruction of an intermediary and their deployment inevitably also adds to the timeframe for the determination of a case. I emphasise where necessary they are invaluable to the party or witness and their legal team and to the court process but the parties and the court should consider carefully in each case whether the requirements set out in the FPR are met.  </p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_11">
	    <num>11.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In considering whether it is necessary the court will wish to consider what other steps can be taken to ensure fair participation. FPR PD3AA identifies a wide range of steps which can support a party participating or giving evidence short of the instruction of an intermediary. It should not be the default position that a witness or party who is identified as vulnerable and needing measures to be taken to support their participation or giving of evidence requires an intermediary. Only if their fair participation cannot be achieved by other measures will an intermediary be necessary. A spectrum exists. The other measures may include those identified in PD3AA para 4.1 and 2 and para 5.3-5.7. A major component of the role of Legal representatives (solicitor and counsel) is to ensure their client understands the proceedings and their role in them, putting their views to the court, ensuring their client is able to give them instructions in advance of court and in court and enabling them to attend court without significant distress. Only if the court is satisfied that the usual support a legal team (adopting the use of the tools available) and other measures available to the court will not enable the party to participate fairly will it be necessary to provide for an intermediary. The tailoring of language and the use of the tools identified in the Advocates Gateway will often be enough to enable fair participation. Only in cases where the court is satisfied that a party or witness cannot give evidence fairly even with the adoption of all the other measures available (see PD3AA 5.3-7 and the Advocates Toolkit Vulnerable Witnesses and Parties in the Family Courts) will it be necessary to appoint an intermediary.</p>

The assistance of an intermediary was considered necessary where a psychologist had found the party&#8217;s full scale IQ was in the borderline range of 70 (i.e. close to learning disability) and in the extremely low range of intellectual ability ,  but with significant variability and significant difficulty in her ability to understand and express herself verbally evident in conversation and assessment which led to a danger that the reliability of her verbal evidence would be significantly reduced. An intermediary subsequently recommended the mother be assisted by an intermediary.  That led the Court of Appeal to conclude that the mother should have had an intermediary for all stages of the court process. The level of difficulty in the mothers functioning was clearly very significant and the court concluded the absence of an intermediary meant the mother did not receive a fair trial.

In that case the Court of Appeal gave detailed consideration to the appointment of intermediaries and how they should be used. Although there are obvious and important differences between Family Court cases and criminal cases the reasons for the appointment of intermediaries and their function in assisting vulnerable parties or witnesses to participate or give their best evidence are essentially the same.  Intermediaries are appointed, whether in criminal or family cases, to ensure that the individual in question can participate in the proceedings so that their fair trial rights are protected. Lieven J identified that at [36] to [42] the Court of Appeal went through the relevant considerations for the appointment of an intermediary, and the alternative strategies that might be adopted, to ensure that a defendant&#8217;s ability to properly engage in proceedings and Article 6 rights were protected:</p>

That projection as to frequency serves as an important reminder to judges that intermediaries are not to be appointed on a "just-in-case" basis or because the report by the intermediary, the psychologist or the psychiatrist has failed to provide the judge with a proper analysis of a vulnerable defendant's needs in the context of the particular circumstances of the trial to come. These are fact-sensitive decisions that call for not only an assessment of the relevant circumstances of the defendant, but also the circumstances of the particular trial. Put otherwise, any difficulty experienced by the defendant must be considered in the context of the actual proceedings which he or she faces.</span></p>

We immediately acknowledge the valuable contribution made to the administration of justice by the use of intermediaries in appropriate cases. We recognise that there are occasions when the use of an intermediary would improve the trial process. That, however, is far from saying that whenever the process would be improved by the availability of an intermediary, it is mandatory for an intermediary to be made available. It can, after all, sometimes be overlooked that as part of their general responsibilities judges are expected to deal with specific communication problems faced by any defendant or any individual witness (whether a witness for the prosecution or the defence) as part and parcel of their ordinary control of the judicial process. When necessary, the processes have to be adapted to ensure that a particular individual is not disadvantaged as a result of personal difficulties, whatever form they may take. In short, the overall responsibility of the trial judge for the fairness of the trial has not been altered because of the increased availability of intermediaries, or indeed the wide band of possible special measures now enshrined in statute.</span></p>

It would, in fact, be a most unusual case for a defendant who is fit to plead to be found to be so disadvantaged by his condition that a properly brought prosecution would have to be stayed. That would be an unjust outcome where, on the face of the evidence, a genuine complaint has properly been brought against the defendant.

Counsel submitted that there was a need for intermediaries because relevant parties often did not understand the proceedings and the language that was being used. However, the first and normal approach to this difficulty is for the judge and the lawyers to ensure that simple language is used, and breaks taken to ensure that litigants understand what is happening. All advocates in cases involving vulnerable parties or witnesses should be familiar with the Advocates Gateway and the advice on how to help vulnerable parties understand and participate in the proceedings.

The spectrum of vulnerability will self-evidently be very wide. Only towards the far end of the spectrum will be the cases where an intermediary is necessary for the giving of evidence. Only at the very far end will be cases where an intermediary is required for the whole of a hearing and only in the very rarest cases is an intermediary likely to be necessary to enable the party to give instructions in advance of a hearing.

There may be evidence from their legal team that even by deployment of all their skills as a solicitor and counsel using the Advocates Toolkits, they do not consider the party or witness can participate fairly without an intermediary. I use these only as examples rather than any attempt to define what evidence would justify an intermediary assessment. An intermediary assessment in most cases will not be a Part 25 Expert appointment but rather a case management direction by the court of a similar nature to the direction for the appointment of an interpreter. HMCTS have contractual arrangements with providers of interpretation and intermediary services to fulfil the courts duty to enable a party or witness to participate. Usually, HMCTS will use their contracted provider but the court may direct an alternative or HMCTS may use an alternative. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Once the Intermediary Assessment is obtained that together with the other evidence which caused the court to commission the Intermediary Assessment will enable the court at a Ground Rules hearing to consider what &#8216;participation directions&#8217; are necessary. As noted above the fact that an Intermediary Assessment opines that a party or witness will be assisted does not make it necessary to appoint an intermediary. Nor a similar opinion from a court appointed expert although clearly the court will give considerable weight to such opinions in reaching its own decision on what is necessary having regard to the whole range of directions which can be made. In some cases, a combination of regular breaks, the use of focussed and simple language, styles of questions, identification of &#8216;Timelines&#8217; to be followed in questioning, or subject matters will be sufficient. In others an intermediary may be required to assist the party in giving their evidence. In rare cases an intermediary may be necessary to assist the party understand the evidence of others.  In very rare cases an intermediary may be necessary to enable the party to consider the written evidence and to give instructions. </p>
