She decreed a final divorce and further, inter alia, ordered that (a) the Respondent should pay the Applicant lump sum alimony of US$2m within 30 days, with statutory interest; and (b) pending payment of the lump sum he should pay her the sum of $4,000 per month commencing 1 September 2011, with credit to be given in respect of such payments against the lump sum award.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Debtors Act 1869 swept away the extensive powers of imprisonment for debt which had existed for centuries prior to then, and which had been acerbically described by Victorian social commentators and novelists. However, by s5 judgment debts carried the ultimate sanction of imprisonment, for a maximum of 6 weeks. But the class of judgment debts thus enforceable was progressively narrowed so that by the time of the passage of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/31" uk:canonical="1970 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1970</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1970/31/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s11</ref> and Sch 4) the debts were confined to maintenance orders and taxes. In addition there were (and are) further statutory powers to imprison people for non-payment of things like rates and television licence fees. Later, a corresponding power was provided in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Support Act 1991</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss39</ref>A and 40. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An application under s5, known as a judgment summons, has always been a common feature of enforcement proceedings in the divorce courts. However, its regular use encountered an obstacle with the enactment of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> and the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Mubarak v Mubarak </span><span class="verdana"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 FLR 698" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 FLR 698</ref>. In that case the Court of Appeal decided that the then prevailing procedure, and the then prescribed forms, were not compliant with article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

I doubt whether experienced specialist practitioners will think that it has sufficient value for money to be worth its initiation. Certainly it seems to me that it will be more or less useless in cases involving fraudulent husbands seeking to conceal assets difficult or impossible to identify specifically.&#8221;&#160; </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Despite that doom-laden prediction the judgment summons did not become extinct. Instead the procedure and forms were reformed. In 2010 the procedure was reiterated and validated anew by Parliament with the promulgation of the Family Procedure Rules (SI 2010 No. 2955). In Part 33, Chapter 2, extensive provisions concerning the issue and the hearing of a judgment summons were set out. PD 5A prescribes Form D62 for the Form in which an application under section 5 is to be made. This form addresses all the concerns of the Court of Appeal which had ruled that the old form by its language appeared to reverse the burden of proof.</p>

Unsurprisingly, therefore, in the relatively recent decision of the Court of Appeal of <span style="font-style:italic">Karoonian v C-MEC</span> [2012] 3 FCR 491, those procedures and paperwork received identical condemnation to those previously meted out in <span style="font-style:italic">Mubarak</span>, </p>

There was a slight difference of opinion between Ward LJ and Richards LJ as to how the procedure could be made compliant, and in this aspect Richards LJ was supported by Patten LJ. In his relatively short judgment Richards LJ set out definitively how the application should be formulated and proved. He said:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span class="bold">&#8220;[56]</span> My starting point is that the statutory scheme under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 39</ref>A-40B is capable of being operated in compliance with art 6. I agree with Ward LJ that, although <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 39</ref>A(3) provides for the court to &#8220;inquire&#8221; as to the Defendant's means and whether there has been wilful refusal or culpable neglect on his part, and s 40(1) requires the court to be of the &#8220;opinion&#8221; that there has been wilful refusal or culpable neglect, the burden lies on the Commission to <span class="italic">prove</span> to the criminal standard that there has been wilful refusal or culpable neglect on his part (which will necessarily include proving that the Defendant has or has had the means to pay the unpaid amount). The District Judge in the case of Gibbons was wrong to say: &#8220;The court is required simply to form an opinion as to whether there has been wilful refusal or culpable neglect. There does not seem to be any burden of proof no[r] standard other than that of 'opinion'&#8221;. The court must be satisfied to the criminal standard, on the basis of all the evidence before it, that there has been wilful refusal or culpable neglect. So much, indeed, is common ground between the parties.</p>

		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span class="bold">[57]</span> It follows that in practice the Commission must adduce sufficient evidence to establish at least a case to answer. In the generality of cases the exercise may not need to be a particularly elaborate one, since there will be a history of default from which inferences can properly be drawn. But the exercise is an essential one: the Defendant is not required to give evidence or to incriminate himself, and in the absence of a case to answer he is entitled to have the application against him dismissed without more. If the Commission establishes a case to answer, there will be an <span class="italic">evidential</span> burden on the Defendant to answer it, but that is unobjectionable in art 6 terms. I would add that there is no requirement under art 6 for the Commission to serve evidence in advance of the hearing, but if it chooses to wait for evidence to be given by the presenting officer at the hearing, the court must be astute to ensure that the Defendant is not taken by surprise and that the matter can proceed at that hearing without unfairness to him.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span class="bold">[58]</span> Provided that the burden and standard of proof and the need procedural fairness are borne clearly in mind, there is in my view no inherent objection to considering the Defendant's means and the issue of wilful default or culpable neglect in a single hearing. They are closely related matters, and it seems to me that the statute contemplates that they will be inquired into at one and the same time: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 39</ref>A(3) provides in terms that on an application under sub-s 1) &#8220;the court shall (in the presence of the liable person) inquire as to (a) whether he needs a driving licence to earn his living, (b) his means, and (c) whether there has been wilful refusal or culpable neglect on his part&#8221;. In so far as Ward LJ considers that this involves an impermissible muddling up of two distinct processes, I respectfully disagree. <span class="italic" style="font-style:italic">Mubarak v Mubarak</span><span class="italic"/>was concerned with a specific regime and I do not read it as laying down any general rule that issues of means and wilful refusal or culpable neglect cannot be considered together. We were not taken to any Strasbourg case-law laying down such a rule. In <span class="italic" style="font-style:italic">Benham v United Kingdom</span><span class="italic"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1996) 22 EHRR 293" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">(1996) 22 EHRR 293</ref>, [1996] ECHR 19380/92, which involved a very similar procedure (see para 19 of the judgment), there was no suggestion that in this respect it offended art 6.&#8221; </p>

They have two children: a boy now aged 21 and a girl now aged 18. In 1992 the parties opened a jewellery shop here known as Veeraji Jewellers. In September 2000 they moved to Georgia, USA, and opened a jewellery shop under the same name in Decatur. Their final matrimonial home in Duluth, Georgia was purchased in the Respondent's sole name in September 2003.</p>

Thus the marriage came to an abrupt end. This led the husband and his father to take dramatic action. The CCTV was turned off and they stripped the shop bare. According to the Respondent's father, who gave evidence before me pursuant to a witness summons issued by the Applicant, this exercise took between two and four days, and involved packing up thousands of boxes which were taken, he believed, by the Respondent in his car to the family home. He was not able to say how many journeys this involved.</p>

Although I was given DVDs of the footage on that occasion nobody could provide me with versions which actually worked. I was however given a summary of what they showed, which was not challenged, together with some still photographs. These show that the shop had been stripped utterly bare.

That did not arise until he was served with divorce proceedings on 4 March 2011 - he left the following day. He told me that he sold all the stock for a pittance to friends, gas station owners, and creditors. Apart from the sale of some of the silver jewellery to Legacy Jewellers, for which there are invoices totalling about $40,000, the Respondent has not produced a single invoice for the sale of the rest, in circumstances where the gold items comprised the great majority of the inventory. He was not able to explain to me, given his obligations to make accurate tax returns, why there was not in existence a single invoice or voucher in respect of these alleged sales. Even the invoices to Legacy Jewellers were said by him to be inaccurate - he received only about a quarter of the price stated.</p>

This was carefully prepared by the Applicant and was her estimate of the quantity and value of jewellery in each zone (as denoted in the shop diagram Exhibit 2) as well as the jewellery which was not on display and kept in one of the two safes. It was not the actual inventory derived from the shop&#8217;s trading records. This was made clear.</p>

It is possible to cross-refer the photographs to the diagram and in turn to the inventory, at least in some instances. For example, there is a photograph of the display unit to the right of the front door which is denoted zone 3A in the diagram. In the photograph you can see 20 necklaces individually displayed. In the inventory the Applicant makes her estimate for Zone 3A by reference to 20 necklaces. Thus there is internal consistency between the various exhibits.</p>

I note at this stage that I was told by Mr Green that the first time he or his client had seen or even known of this inventory was on the first day of the hearing before me.  While I of course accept this in relation to Mr Green I completely reject the Respondent's suggestion that he was ignorant of the existence or contents of this document. On the contrary, his own attorney in Georgia had debated it with the court at great length and had cross-examined the Applicant about it.</p>

She produced schedules, Exhibit 8, being summaries of the business&#8217;s tax returns as provided in the Respondent's financial disclosure. She pointed out that there were some odd aspects to these. First, she would have expected the gross profit margin for a business like this to have been 50% but here it was very much less. Second, the opening and closing balances of the sums recorded as representing inventory did not reflect transactions during any given year. Third, there was no compensation recorded for the owners. Fourth, there was an almost complete absence of records of inventory given in disclosure so that it was "<span style="font-style:italic">very very difficult to reconstruct what the actual inventory is</span>". It was noteworthy that for the year 2010 no amount was recorded for inventory at all. Fifth, the income as disclosed on the tax returns bore no relationship to the family expenditure (as summarised in Exhibit 10 &#8211; about $108,000 per annum), nor did they bear much relationship to the Respondent's personal tax returns (the summary of which was Exhibit 9).</p>

The Applicant gave evidence along the same lines as she had in Georgia in August 2011. She was similarly cross-examined and it was put to her that she had grossly over-estimated in particular the value of gold at the time that she prepared her schedule. It was suggested that in the early part of 2011 gold was trading at about $1,000 per ounce, rather than the $2,000 that her calculations were based on. Moreover, it was suggested that in terms of numbers of individual items and their weight she had grossly exaggerated. She stood firm in her testimony and I judged her to be a truthful and convincing witness.</p>

I made it clear to Mr Green that the Respondent was under no obligation to do so, nor otherwise to incriminate himself. In his evidence in chief he stated that the price of gold between January and March 2011 was about $1,200 per ounce; it went up to $1,700 later in the year. She stated that the weight attributed by the wife to individual items was much too high; the idea of 50g being the weight of gold in a bangle was he said absurd - it would be more like 5g to 10g. An Indian woman would wear perhaps 10 bangles on one arm and the idea of her carrying around half a kilogram in weight on her arm was fanciful. He stated that the idea that there was as much value in the safe as on display was equally fanciful. He completely disagreed with the Applicant&#8217;s estimates in relation to silverware which he said was grossly exaggerated. He stated that he had sold everything that was in the shop between January and March 2011 but had kept no receipts and that he had not completed a US tax return for 2011. He said he was at the time heartbroken and distressed; he had lost his home and his family and so just got rid of the stock quickly and for a pittance. He confirmed that he went to Africa, India and Dubai to see his family and that he had also enjoyed holidays in Thailand and Europe.</p>

He was not able to give any explanation as to why he turned off the CCTV on 31 December 2010 other than to say he &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">didn't need it any more</span>&#8221;. He confirmed that on 23 January 2011 he turned it back on in order to protect himself when the Applicant came to visit. He said that he had placed the items into the jiffy bags in order to ship them back to the people who had bought the stock, as well as to return items that were on sale and return. He said that he did not attend the hearing because he feared he would be arrested at the behest of the wife who was prone to making false allegations against him. He agreed that Mr Estes had advised him to appeal the judgment and order but he was not able to give any explanation as to why he had not done so. He stated that nobody had ever asked him to produce paperwork to show what he had got from the sales (which was a strange answer given that the questionnaire directly asked for this).  He was not able to explain why in the business&#8217;s 2010 tax return the inventory had completely disappeared. He agreed that Tanzania, Kenya, India, and Dubai were countries in which it was very easy to trade in gold items. He explained that the high payments to garages on his credit cards were referable to the cars of his brother and parents.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are my conclusions. The evidence given in Georgia and the findings made by Judge Blum establish a case for the Respondent to answer. That is accepted by Mr Green. However, the Applicant has gone much further than merely establishing a case to answer. Basically the financial remedy case has been reheard. On the basis of the evidence I have heard I am satisfied so that I am sure that there was inventory in December 2010 in the shop in Decatur with a retail value of around $5 million. I reject the Respondent&#8217;s attempt to cast doubt on the Applicant&#8217;s evidence. His evidence was unpersuasive and was advanced at the 59<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> minute of the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> hour in circumstances where I am satisfied that he must have been fully aware of the Applicant&#8217;s case from the time of hearing before Judge Blum on 24 August 2011. </p>

I am not in a position to find whether the items have since been sold in Africa, India or Dubai or whether they have been placed for safekeeping there or elsewhere. However either the items themselves are, or money representing their value is, retained by the Respondent either directly or by members of his family. Of this I am sure.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It follows that I am wholly satisfied so that I am sure that the Respondent has at all times had the means to pay the award and has refused to do so. This is a case where the scale of the default is extremely high and where the position has been seriously aggravated by the completely false evidence which has been given to me by the Respondent. I therefore sentence him to serve the maximum period in prison that section 5 allows, namely six weeks. The question is whether this shall be suspended for a period to allow him time, even now, to comply with its obligations. Generally speaking the power under section 5 is coercive. Almost invariably the first order will be a suspended sentence thereby supplying the necessary coercion. I see no reason why that should not be adopted in this case. Therefore I suspend the sentence for a period of three months. If the sum has not been paid within that period the matter must then be returned before me before any warrant of execution may be issued.</p>

It was implicit in my reasoning that the modern form of order is an injunction restraining the Respondent from leaving the jurisdiction and requiring his passport to be held either by the tipstaff or, as in this case, the Applicant&#8217;s  solicitors. The writ ne exeat regno is a charming historical relic but must be regarded as an anachronism given the availability of the modern form of order. The decision of <span style="font-style:italic">B v B (Injunction: Jurisdiction)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 1 WLR 329" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 1 WLR 329</ref> establishes that after judgment an injunction restraining movement out of the jurisdiction cannot be made as a free-standing measure of enforcement. It has to be linked to another measure and must be time-limited. Accordingly, I discharge the existing writ and make a fresh injunction which will endure until the matter is returned to me pursuant to the preceding paragraph, or until the Respondent discharges his obligations, if earlier.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As indicated by me during counsel&#8217;s speeches I further intend to make a charging order in relation to the Respondent's 25% interest in 116 Mayfield Avenue. Normally the first such order would be an interim order because the application would be made ex parte. However given that both parties are represented before me it is appropriate for me to make a final order now. For the avoidance of doubt I waive the requirement on the Applicant to file an application for general enforcement under FPR 2010 r33(2)(b). Plainly if the Respondent satisfies the award save as to &#163;92,000 (being the value of 16 Mayfield Avenue covered by the charging order) then he must be taken to have satisfied it entirely.</p>
