A hospital outpatient clinic letter following admission refers to a diagnosis of dementia. Her cognitive impairment leads her to need a rigid routine, suffer anxiety with sustained concentration, and have significant memory impairment. A general visitor found her to be generally confused, with a short concentration span, appearing disorientated, and could not participate in conversation beyond a very basic level.</span></p>

I was told by Nurse Adams that she tended to get agitated if she had to concentrate very long. She also had some expressive and receptive dysphasia, making communication difficult. She was unable to recognise some simple words, and often unable to express herself fully. She was disorientated in time and place, had poor short and long term memory, impaired concentration and difficulties understanding even mildly complex abstract concepts.</span></p>

This is of a severity to affect her understanding of information, impair her recall and make her unable to weigh information in the balance, for any significant decision. She was unable to understand the nature and effects of an LPA to a sufficient degree or to choose an attorney, was not aware of her financial dealings and could not recall detail sufficiently well or concentrate long enough to weigh information in the balance to come to decisions about an attorney or to direct or instruct an attorney.&#8221;</span></p>

In the absence of any contrary evidence, the Public Guardian maintains that Miss Buckley&#8217;s finances may have been used to heavily subsidize what appears to be a reptile breeding business, without any formal guarantee or security or her share of the alleged investment returns. C also appears to have misappropriated &#163;43,317.47 of her aunt&#8217;s estate without obtaining consent, contrary to what she had told the police. I have therefore re-referred this matter back to the police to conduct further enquiries.</span></p>

Therefore, the Public Guardian would like to request the court to revoke and cancel the registered LPA executed by Miss Buckley under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/22/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22(4)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>. Should the court decide to appoint a deputy in the interests of Miss Buckley, the Public Guardian would like to highlight that the deputy may need to take action against the former attorney in order to restore Miss Buckley&#8217;s estate to a more realistic level. The care manager of (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">a named local authority</span><span style="font-size:11pt">) has confirmed that the council is willing to consider applying to become Miss Buckley&#8217;s property and affairs deputy.&#8221; </span></p>

The first is that attorneys should keep the donor&#8217;s money and property separate from their own or anyone else&#8217;s: Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice, paragraph 7.68. This applies to investments and, wherever possible, all investments should be made in the donor&#8217;s name. If, for any reason, it is not possible to register the investment in the donor&#8217;s name, the attorney should execute a declaration of trust or some other formal record acknowledging the donor&#8217;s beneficial interest in the asset.</p>

She cannot afford for her money to be taken. She needs every penny.&#8221;</span></p>
