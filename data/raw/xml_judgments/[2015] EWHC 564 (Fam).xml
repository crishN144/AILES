As I will explain, the case is complex both factually and legally. For this reason it has been transferred to the High Court. It is not yet concluded and there will need to be at least one further hearing before a final order can be made. Both MG and JG instruct counsel under the Direct Access scheme. They have already enlarged the mortgage on their property by &#163;20,000 to pay costs. This notwithstanding, counsel are now owed fees. In addition MG and JG owe fees to experts. Counsel have made it clear that they will not continue to act until arrears of fees are paid and there is an assurance that future fees will be paid. This is perfectly reasonable. The fees that they have charged in the past, and propose to charge in the future, have been heavily discounted from the market rate already, and that is a worthy reflection of the best traditions of the Bar. But it is not reasonable to expect them to work for nothing. Their families, and the staff of their chambers, need them to earn reasonable fees.  </p>

It removed legal aid from private law children proceedings save in those exceptional cases where domestic violence is a central feature. In such a case the alleged victim, but not the alleged perpetrator, might receive legal aid. Otherwise, at a stroke, 63 years of state funding of cases such as this was swept away. Had that "reform" not taken place both MG and JG would have been entitled to legal aid, although in JG's case subject to a contribution, estimated to be &#163;1,004<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Sections 49 to 54 of LASPO put the powers of the court to award a costs allowance on a statutory footing in relation to divorce and civil partnership dissolution proceedings. It is hard to understand why the government felt so strongly about the removal of legal aid from ancillary relief proceedings given that the statutory charge meant that it would recover the costs it had funded, with interest. The award of a costs allowance in ancillary relief proceedings does not normally give rise to complaints of injustice as the claimant can validly argue that she is only seeking an advance on her undivided and undistributed share, and the effect of the award can always be reconsidered and reflected in the ultimate discretionary disposition. These considerations just do not apply in children proceedings, and particularly so in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> proceedings.</p>

There would be a gross inequality of arms, and arguably a violation of their rights under Articles 6 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 47 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. So even though it cannot be said that JF has behaved reprehensibly or unreasonably he is the only realistic source of costs funding, subject to whatever contribution MG and JG should make from their own very limited resources. Some may say (and have said) that this is grossly unjust; I myself refrain from comment.</p>

Prior to 2005 MG (35) and JG (45), both females, formed a same-sex relationship and commenced cohabitation in a home they bought in the north of England. They in fact entered into a civil partnership on 14 July 2006. Unfortunately in April 2014, during the course of these proceedings they separated. Their civil partnership was dissolved on 9 February 2015.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2005 JG and MG decided they wanted a child. The responded to an entry placed by JF (62) in a register for "lesbian women and gay men seeking a non-sexual parenting partner". JF holds dual British and US citizenship and works in an academic position here. He lives in a same-sex relationship with a man in the south of England. According to his witness statement the mothers "were looking for someone who wants to be a biological father and have a relationship with their child, but doesn't want to be an equal co-parent". There were lengthy discussions. It was agreed that JF would be named on the birth certificate and that JG would be a "legal step-parent" with the idea that all three would have equal legal rights.  </p>

JF was present at the hospital. A legal agreement as to JG's status was made on 23 May 2007, the day JFG's birth was registered. On 13 August 2007 JFG was registered as an American citizen at the US Embassy.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From 2007 to October 2012 JF enjoyed periodic contact with JFG monthly or bi-monthly. The contact was typically based at the home of the mothers, or at JF's home, although JF was able to take his son out. Sometimes JF stayed at the home; sometimes in a hotel. In July 2012 MG fell pregnant, this time by a donor who has played no part in the life of PG who was born on 2 May 2013. In October 2012 the three adults and their son visited the USA (for the second time) for the purposes of attending the interment of JF's late mother. From October 2012 serious difficulties have arisen in relation to the contact of JF to JFG. All are agreed that the relationship between the mothers and the father broke down although, inevitably, there is strong disagreement as to why. It cannot be gainsaid however that MG's pregnancy was a contributory factor. The mothers say that the father had become increasingly individualistic and demanding about contact; the father says that he was being increasingly marginalised. The difficulties led to a solicitor's letter on the father's behalf. Progressively matters got worse. JFG himself began to express hostility to contact with his father. An issue about biological identity reared its head. An issue about education arose &#8211; the mothers wished JFG to be educated at home. An issue arose about JFG's phobia of needles in the context of his vaccinations. Conflict erupted on many fronts. Contact completely broke down, and was suspended on the recommendation of the previous Guardian pending advice from the psychologist. The separation of MG and JG, and illness on the part of MG, seriously aggravated the situation so much so that the Guardian made an application to the court under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> seeking an investigation by the local authority. That application was never in fact substantively adjudicated.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 4 December 2013 JF issued his application for a contact order. On 31 January 2014 he issued a further <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> application seeking specific issue orders about education and vaccination, as well as an application for assessment and therapeutic intervention from a child psychiatrist. On 4 February JFG was made a party and a guardian was appointed. There have been seven further court hearings, including a pre-hearing review before me. The matter was transferred to the High Court. On 9 October 2014 Moylan J ordered that an educational psychologist and a psychologist be appointed and do write reports. By the time of the pre-hearing review before me on 13 January 2015 both had written exhaustive reports. The psychologist recommended a detailed programme of supervised, facilitated contact to seek to restore the relationship between father and son, and many other therapeutic recommendations were also made. At the PHR all parties accepted these recommendations in principle. The final hearing was listed before me on 24 February 2015. The parties spent the better part of two days hammering out the details in a lengthy and detailed consent order. This sets up the managed contact and provides for an IRH where with hope a final order may be made. However it rightly anticipates a worst case scenario of a failure of the programme and provides for a five day final hearing in that event (which all fervently hope will not happen). </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">MG's claim is as follows. She owes now to counsel &#163;10,670, including the refresher for 25 February 2015. She owes to the experts &#163;2,182 as her share of the fees under an order previously made. She seeks &#163;2,200 as counsel's fees for the IRH. She does not seek now funding for the final hearing; that will be dealt with by me at the IRH if that dreadful scenario eventuates. So she seeks a total of &#163;15,252. JG's claim is much the same save that she now owes counsel less; she owes &#163;5,910. So she seeks a total of &#163;10,492. In addition both MG and JG seek that they should not have to contribute to any future all non-legal professional costs whether in respect of expert evidence or therapeutic work.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">MG's financial position, <span style="font-weight:bold">based on her Form E and the submissions made at the hearing</span>, is as follows. Although she co-owns her home with JG I was told that provided JG can be released from the mortgage she (JG) will transfer her share to MG in exchange for a clean break. The home is worth &#163;165,000; there is a mortgage of &#163;108,761. After notional costs of sale and mortgage penalties there is equity of about &#163;53,000. MG has no other capital. Aside from costs she has debts of &#163;3,800. Her income is made up of benefits of just under &#163;20,000 per annum. She is writing a PhD thesis and receives a bursary which after expenses nets down to &#163;2,200. She receives child support from JF of &#163;10,296 (for JFG) and from JG of &#163;5,088 (for both children).  Her total income is about &#163;37,500, from which she must support herself, pay her mortgage and care for two children.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, after this judgment had been largely completed in draft and just before it was due to be sent out I received further witness statements from MG and JG. These revealed that the transfer by JG had in fact already happened on 9 February 2015. Further in order to enable MG to take over the mortgage she had to demonstrate a traditional source of income. As she was not working the only way she could do this was by purchasing a small nearby property on a buy-to-let basis so that she could show a rental income. That has duly happened and so instead of having one property with a value of &#163;165,000 and a mortgage of &#163;108,761 she now has two properties with a combined value of &#163;280,000 with total mortgages of &#163;225,971. The combined notional equities is in fact about &#163;42,000: it is less than the &#163;53,000 mentioned above because of increased costs of sale and mortgage penalties given that there are now two properties. Further the costs of purchase of, and SDLT in relation to, the new property have also enlarged the overall mortgage debt.</p>

It involved deliberate misrepresentations to JF, and I have received a justifiably lengthy position statement from Ms King complaining about this. In truth, it was not however a <span style="font-weight:bold">material</span> non-disclosure so far as JF is concerned as the revelations show that MG is actually worse off than I had believed to the tune of &#163;11,000.</p>

The purchase price was found as to &#163;58,000 on mortgage and &#163;92,000 as a loan from her father. I do not regard that later debt as so soft that it should be ignored. She has very recently revealed that she has received a PPI compensation payment of &#163;1,500; aside from that she has no savings and has debts of &#163;2,500. She therefore has no net capital assets. She works for a charity earning net &#163;27,500 per annum from which the child support of just over &#163;5,000 is paid leaving her with &#163;22,500.</p>

The answer may not uncommonly be an order for equal apportionment of the costs but that cannot be assumed. It may be that a full consideration of the circumstances of the case produces the result that the publicly funded party should be paying a greater share of the costs in any event, quite irrespective of any financial difficulties that the other parties may have in sharing the cost of the expert.

Rather, it assumes the facts as they are with the sole exception that the child is not legally aided but is funded from another source, such as his own means or the means of a relative of substance. Were that the position I would have no hesitation in making an order that JFG bear the costs of these further reports given that MG and JG do not, on my findings, have the means to do so, and given the burdens that I have already imposed on JF. Further, and in any event, it is just and reasonable that JFG bears these costs whether or not he is legally aided because at the end of the day these fees are being incurred primarily for his benefit. </p>
