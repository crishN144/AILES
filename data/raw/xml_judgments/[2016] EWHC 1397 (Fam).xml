	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">This case concerns a little boy, A, who was born on [date stated] and is therefore 2&#189; years old.  He is presently in foster care in this jurisdiction.  The proceedings about which he is at the centre are care proceedings issued by Doncaster&#160;Metropolitan Borough Council on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2016 in circumstances which I will come to.  Those circumstances were such as to put in doubt the question of A&#8217;s habitual residence and therefore the question of the English court&#8217;s jurisdiction.  Hence, in accordance with recent Court of Appeal authorities, this hearing has been set up by an order of mine dated 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2016 to resolve the question of jurisdiction.  This judgment is intended not only to rule on that question, but also to assist the court and/or the social services in the Czech Republic.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">There has been considerable difficulty contacting and remaining in contact with &#8216;M&#8217;, as I shall call M of A.  I describe her as that, although (because of the circumstances in which A came to the attention of the authorities here) there was considered to be potential doubt about his maternity such as to need DNA testing.  There is in fact an extant order within the care proceedings for such DNA testing to be performed.  As I say, however, this hearing has proceeded on the basis that M is A&#8217;s mother and I shall proceed on the same basis without being taken as deciding or attempting to decide the point.  </p>

I am additionally glad that she has been represented by counsel, Mr Duffy, to whom the court is grateful for taking on the case at such short notice.  I likewise express my appreciation to the interpreter, Miss Vislcekova, who I am told had to get up extremely early this morning to be here and she has interpreted with great efficiency.  Trying to conduct cases like this, which have a major international element, is extremely difficult without proficient translation.  The other representations at this hearing have been as follows.  The Local Authority has been represented by Miss Stanistreet and the children&#8217;s guardian, Mrs Hobson, by Miss Richardson.  </p>

I say at once, and this is a caveat, that the information which follows has come in piecemeal from M.  It has come in through two telephone calls from her with staff of the Local Authority and from emails to the Local Authority from the Czech Embassy in London relaying what she told Embassy staff.  There is therefore room for misunderstandings in the information which now follows and I am not, by setting out the following facts, intending to make findings; merely to set out as best I can a summary of the main information which this court has.  </p>

She has told the court this morning that she has six children in all; BC, born in 2002; DE born in 2003; FG born in 2007; IJ born in 2008; A who was born in 2013; and KL born in 2015.  Two of these children live with their respective fathers; three live with M (or presently with their maternal grandparents) in the Czech Republic; and then there is A, who is in foster care in this jurisdiction as already stated.  M tells me through Mr Duffy that A is himself a Czech citizen.  As I have said, he was born on [date stated].  This was in a [named] Hospital in Leeds, who have confirmed by letter that on the date just mentioned:</p>

Five days later, on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th&#160;</span>November 2013, M left that address with A and, according to her version of events, went with A to Germany and, more particularly, to Z&#8217;s parents.  She stayed with them with A, she says, for some eight or nine months.  In about July 2014 (from calculating the months) M, Z and A moved from Germany to the Czech Republic, where they lived at an accommodation centre in Prague provided by the State.  They remained there for some four or five months.  In around November or December 2014 (again from calculating the months) M, Z and <span style="text-transform:uppercase">A</span> went, intending this to be temporary, to Slovakia to stay with members of Z&#8217;s family.  This stay must have been for a number of weeks.  In January&#160;2015, the three of them returned to Prague where they stayed until April 2015.  In April 2015, they moved within the Czech Republic to an address in Opava.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In May or June 2015, M&#8217;s stepsister apparently became ill in Prague.  M took A with her to Prague to care for this stepsister; but after two or three weeks she realised it was not appropriate for A to witness what she has described as the terminal illness of the stepsister.  Therefore, she says that she asked her partner, Z, to take A back to Opava.  However, it turned out that they were in the process of being evicted from their home in Opava and therefore (according to M) they agreed and arranged in about June 2015 that Z would bring A to the United&#160;Kingdom, &#8216;&#8230;with the intention that M would follow shortly.&#8217;  M remained in Prague.  She now says that it was her intention to locate to this country permanently when she was able to move having regard to her stepsister&#8217;s illness.  She has not been consistent about that, having originally described the move of A to this jurisdiction as temporary.  </p>

This can be described as an allegation of their having been &#8216;trafficked&#8217; here.  The police would obviously have asked them where they lived and later that day the police attended at an address in Doncaster.  There they found A.  The papers are not entirely clear, but the Local Authority&#8217;s distinct understanding is that he (A) was found in the care of two men, one of whom, Y (a man with the same surname as M&#8217;s then partner), was arrested.  A himself was taken by the police under their emergency powers to a foster carer where he has remained ever since and where he is doing well.  </p>

He was therefore allowed to go.  Sometime after 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015, when it seems that Y had returned to the Czech Republic, he told M, according to her version of events, that the social services had found A &#8216;in a flat with strangers&#8217; and had removed him.  </p>

The email gave a telephone number and an email address; but telephone calls by Local Authority staff failed, as did an email to the stated email address.  On 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015, an email was received by the Local Authority from Mr P of the Czech Embassy in London [C6] saying that M had told them that her partner, Z, had taken A &#8216;temporarily&#8217; to the United Kingdom.  However, the email continued that &#8220;&#8230;as he, Z, was returning to the Czech Republic to see M, he, Z, had left A with Y&#8221;.  M, according to the Embassy&#8217;s email, described Y as being a cousin of hers.</p>

M told Miss Strachen that her (the mother&#8217;s) sister had been dying of abdominal cancer in Prague and that she had been caring for her.  She said she had arranged for her three daughters to be cared for by her own mother in Opava and had agreed to her partner, Z, and her (or his?) cousin, Y, bringing A to England &#8220;&#8230;to see family in Leeds.&#8221;  </p>

On that occasion, M was telephoned from the court by the social workers and they had a telephone conversation with her, the notes of which are now to be found at C37.  M has since confirmed that these notes are accurate.  Much of what I have already described is taken from that telephone call.  That brings the matter up to date.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Here, A was apparently being cared for by M&#8217;s partner.  She (M) had made no plans for him (A) within this jurisdiction and on the initial occasions of her providing information, she described his (A&#8217;s) stay in England as &#8220;temporary.&#8221;  No one who was caring for A in this jurisdiction had parental responsibility for him and M had understood that he was going to Leeds to see friends; whereas in fact he was found in Doncaster, an arrangement about which she appeared to know nothing.  There is no suggestion that A was placed in any nursery or registered with a doctor.  His carers were (or were associated with) men who complained to the police that they had been brought here on a false promise of work and accommodation and were then given very poor accommodation and not paid for their work.  So there is a case for saying that they were &#8216;trafficked&#8217; here.  Overall, the arrangements have a disorganised, unplanned and unstable, if not transitory, feel about them.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I am not at all surprised that the Local Authority has accepted the difficulty in asserting that this court has jurisdiction and it has not sought to do so.  The children&#8217;s guardian agrees with that approach, as does M herself.  In my judgment, A cannot be shown (on the facts as they are known) to have had by 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2016 a sufficient degree of integration in a social and family environment at the address where he was found in Doncaster.  Accordingly, I conclude and hold that this court does not have jurisdiction over these care proceedings.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">It is not my role to go further and I do not wish to appear to be trespassing on the province of another court.  However, from my examination of the facts, it would appear that A was habitually resident in the Czech Republic from July 2014 until June 2015.  That is the country of the citizenship of both M and himself.  Thus, all things considered, it would appear that A is very probably now habitually resident in the Czech Republic.  It is in that country that M lives, as do her parents and her other children.  It is where she herself would like A&#8217;s future to be decided.  It was described by M&#8217;s counsel, Mr Duffy, this morning as &#8220;&#8230;her home, where she has her children who are presently cared for by the maternal grandparents and it is where one finds the nucleus of the family.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">My order will therefore be predicated on A being now returned by the Local Authority&#8217;s social workers to the Czech Republic, on the basis that this country has no jurisdiction.  M accepts that she cannot expect to care for A without a thorough prior examination of his welfare: how he came to be in this country; her commitment to him; the family dynamics within her family and so on.  There should therefore be a relatively straightforward transition from the Local Authority&#8217;s social workers in this country to social workers in the Czech Republic, so as to enable the authorities in that jurisdiction to consider and determine A&#8217;s safety, his welfare and his future.  The Local Authority has indicated its willingness to provide the Czech authorities with all and any information which would be useful to that jurisdiction, to include a translated copy of this Judgment and of my Order.</p>
