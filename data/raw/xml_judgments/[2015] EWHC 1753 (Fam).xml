	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned in this unusual and difficult case with the welfare of two children, S born in September 2010 in Pakistan and her younger sister, T, born in this country in June 2012. Their parents had married in Pakistan in 2009 and came to live in this country in 2012 shortly before T was born. The mother died, tragically young, of cancer in September 2013.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There had been litigation in the mother&#8217;s lifetime, triggered by the father&#8217;s removal of the children to Pakistan in December 2012. The children were made wards of court on 8 January 2013 and have remained wards ever since. The father remained in Pakistan and did not return to this country until 12 April 2014. In the meantime, following their mother&#8217;s death, the children lived initially with a maternal uncle in Reading and, in April 2014, with family in Bedfordshire for a short time before returning to the maternal uncle in Reading.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 9 April 2014 the children&#8217;s maternal great aunt and great uncle, who live in Illinois in the United States of America, had begun proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, seeking leave to remove the children from this country to live with them in Illinois.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Much of the delay has been caused by the need, first, to obtain expert advice from lawyers in the United States of America as to how, compatibly with their immigration law, it might be possible for the children to go and live permanently with the applicants in Illinois and, then, to consider the implications of that advice. There is no need for me to go into the detail. Put shortly, it is common ground that, if this is to be achieved, the applicants must comply with procedures requiring completion of the United States of America&#8217;s Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Forms I-800A and I-800. These require that the children be adopted by the applicants in accordance with the Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption, concluded at the Hague on 29 May 1993. Initially, the applicants were minded to seek an adoption order in this country. Their plan now is to seek an adoption order in Illinois, having first obtained from this court an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/84" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 84</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>.</p>

For the reasons given by Munby J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re SL (Adoption: Home in Jurisdiction)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/1283" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 1283 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 1283 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 118" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 118</ref> it is not necessary that the &#8216;home environment&#8217; to which reference is made in the opening lines of subs (7), should refer to the home to which reference is subsequently made in (7)(b). I think the purpose of subs (7)(b) is to ensure that where no adoption agency is involved, a local authority takes responsibility for carrying out the assessment that must be made before an adoption order is made. Since each local authority is responsible only for its own area it was necessary to impose that duty on the local authority for the area in which the home lies. Where an adoption agency is involved, there is no need for any similar provision. Accordingly, I do not think that one can infer from subs (7)(b) that the home must be in the jurisdiction in any case falling outside its ambit.&#8221;</p>

The father&#8217;s argument, however, is based on the wording of Articles 4 and 16 of the Convention which, he submits, plainly contemplates that a Convention adoption such as is proposed in this case cannot proceed in the absence of parental consent. </p>

The second is that, in truth, adoption is being considered here only because of the seeming imperatives of United States of America immigration law. As the local authority puts it, the issue of adoption would certainly not have arisen but for the stance of the United States of America&#8217;s authorities. Counsel for the guardian was equally explicit: &#8220;It is purely the immigration requirements of the USA which dictate that although the dispute is between family members, a placement with the applicants will require an adoption process.&#8221;</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In the area of practical needs I do feel that [the father&#8217;s] reports and photographs about how he can provide for their material needs such as a comfortable home, proper education and play activities are genuine. He is also clearly able to provide positive parent-child interactions and is aware of their need for reassurance, physical affection and stimulation. I would say his time spent with his children is of a generally high quality.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">It is in the realm of their emotional needs that I have reservations about [his] parenting capacity. I feel that he has little awareness or insight into how much pain and grief he caused them in removing them from their mother when she was so vulnerable and when he basically removed himself from their lives. To me the latter was an act of thoughtlessness that was likely to leave the children feeling rejected and to have caused uncertainty about their relationship with him.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Overall my conclusion is this. [The father] has a positive relationship with his children as observed in his contact with them. However, I believe that there is a difference between spending short periods of enjoyable time with children and having their full time care. </p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I am concerned that his repeated denial about not having had permission to take the children to Pakistan and the long absence from the children indicates a lack of insight.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Another important issue is his reliability in what he says and in his actions. Having examined this during my involvement in this matter in my opinion he has clearly been unreliable and in my view this would not indicate a positive outcome for these children. I therefore cannot support his having their full time care.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The father&#8217;s position is not without merit and this is a finely balanced decision. If there was no one but the children&#8217;s father to care for them it is likely that despite his deficits he might be considered good enough. However if there is an alternative, and I accept that the mechanism for achieving an adoption placement for the children in the USA is inchoate, I take the view for the reasons adumbrated within this report, that this is preferable and in the children&#8217;s best lifelong interests than living with their father in Pakistan.</p>

I agree with the father that the material at present before the court falls far short of meeting the required standard. Taking the matters I have summarised in paragraph 68 above at their highest, the case for adoption is simply not made out. One really only has to consider what is said in the reports of LB and JP and, equally significant, what those reports do <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>say.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This being so, the second question is whether the proceedings should nonetheless continue. This comes down to two questions: (1) Is there some solid, evidence based, reason to believe that with further forensic activity &#8211; the testing of the existing evidence by cross-examination or giving the parties an opportunity to adduce further evidence &#8211; the conclusion might be different? This requires a robust and realistic appraisal of what is possible, an appraisal which is evidence based, with a solid foundation, not driven by sentiment or a hope that &#8216;something may turn up&#8217;. (2) Is there some solid advantage to the children in continuing the proceeding? </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, there is no basis in the materials currently before the court for any belief that prolongation of the process carries with it any realistic prospect of the court ever being satisfied that the father&#8217;s consent requires to be dispensed with, that nothing else will do. The deficit in the existing evidence is simply too great to imagine that there is any realistic prospect of the gap being bridged. And in the circumstances, not least bearing in mind the length of time these proceedings have been going on, far from there being any solid advantage to the children in continuing the proceedings, their welfare requires finality now.</p>

The children go to him because the only alternative is ruled out because adoption is ruled out. But it is fundamentally important that children are not to be adopted merely because their parenting is less than perfect, indeed, perhaps, only barely adequate.
