They have two children O now aged 17 and J now aged 16. In May 2011 they separated; the wife continues to live in the former matrimonial home while the husband lives in rented accommodation. The former matrimonial home is subject to an agricultural tie which has the effect of suppressing its value, although it may be possible to shift the tie to another property owned by the husband. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At the time of the marriage the husband was an established market gardener, although he has also since had a business in the manufacture, sale and hiring of horseboxes; that line of business is now defunct. In addition he has a portfolio of properties some of which are rented to the market gardening businesses; some of which are rented to residential tenants; and one of which stands empty and derelict. The market gardening businesses are, first, S Ltd. It produces lettuces in greenhouses which are sold to multiples. Unfortunately one multiple has recently signified that they are going to terminate their arrangement with S Ltd. </p>

The other two shareholders who each own a third of the ordinary shares are LW and KB. This company grows and sells tomatoes, aubergines, strawberries and blueberries. In addition it has a packing arm for certain third parties. The lettuces of S Ltd are sold to multiples through one of its subsidiaries (although there is no profit on the turn for F Ltd in doing so). F Ltd&#8217;s operations are all undertaken in the North West of England.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">F Ltd is in negotiations to take over or merge with another unincorporated business, MS, which is owned by BGL. This is to secure a contract with a multiple in circumstances where the multiple wants to limit its suppliers and cut out middle men. According to AR, a director of SCP, which firm is advising F Ltd, and who I judge to be a witness of unimpeachable integrity, the only benefit will be the consolidation of the multiple contract; there will be no synergetic benefits. No money will change hands. What will happen is that the business of MS will be hived off into a new company which will be owned by F Ltd. BGL will become a shareholder in F Ltd and will also receive loan notes. The deal is far from concluded but everyone is hopeful that it will be. For some reason the husband was extremely guarded about revealing this negotiation in the course of these proceedings.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">However, the parties have spent vast sums on costs. By the time of the FDR on 12 March 2014 the parties had already spent &#163;226,000 on costs. This was a totally disproportionate sum given the scale of the assets. That said, costs of this scale - about 8% of the assets - are not uncommon, disproportionate though they are. One reason why so much forensic acrimony was generated, with the consequential burgeoning of costs, was that the Deputy District Judge at the first appointment on 9 November 2012 permitted each party to have their own expert to value the husband's business interests, notwithstanding the terms of Part 25 FPR which clearly stated then (and even more strongly states now &#8211; see PD 25D para 2.1) that a SJE should be used "wherever possible". Not "ideally" or "generally" but "wherever possible". In this case the forensic accountants have filed a total of no fewer than six expert reports and have prepared a joint statement setting out their extensive disagreements. They have charged a total of &#163;154,000 in fees. The husband has been permitted during the course of the case to ditch his expert and to instruct a new one. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In this case since the failure of the FDR a mere eight months ago the parties have between them spent on costs the staggering sum of just under &#163;700,000. I must confess to have been almost lost for words when the scale of this madness was revealed to me. They have spent a total of &#163;920,000 in costs. Of this they have spent, as I have said, &#163;154,000 on forensic accountants valuing the Husband's business interests. They have spent on costs nearly a third of everything they built up over 18 years; most of it over the last eight months. The result has been to make a case that was surely so easily settleable almost impossible to compromise, and to impose on the High Court a seven day trial where the principal focus has been a bitter war of recrimination and denunciation about who was more at fault for this appalling state of affairs. This is well illustrated by the fact that of the 18 pages of Miss Harrison's final written submissions nine were devoted to costs and her argument that the husband was responsible for them. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Although the mantra "something must be done" is repeated time and again, nothing ever is.

The procedural reforms of 1996 and 2000 tried to address the problem, but with only limited success, as this and many other egregious cases show only too clearly. In the civil sphere the Jackson reforms of 2013 were intended to curb excessive litigation costs. In his lecture to the Association of Costs Lawyers on 11 May 2012  Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury, then Master of the Rolls, said this:</p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">"Excess litigation cost has for too long been an endemic and unwelcome feature of our civil justice system. In his 1986 Hamlyn lectures, Sir Jack Jacob rightly described it as having long been &#8216;the most baneful feature of English Civil Justice.&#8217;, and he was by no means the first person to do so. In the quarter century that has passed since those lectures things have got worse."</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Yet the Jackson reforms in the civil sphere limit merely the costs recoverable by the winner from the losing party by confining them to a pre-approved costs budget. They do not seek to limit the amount of costs that a lawyer may charge his own client, even though this had been mooted during the process of the review. I suppose that to do so was regarded as an impermissible interference with the right to form whatever commercial contracts you want and to spend your money on whatever you like. Yet that argument simply does not wash when those very costs come out of a finite pot over which the other party has a valid claim. </p>

In other words, hourly billing fails to reward the diligent, the efficient and the able: its focus on the cost of time, a truly moveable feast, simply does not reflect the value of work."</p>

It might also have the beneficial consequence that the present volume of self-representation deriving from the wholesale withdrawal of legal aid from private family law cases is reduced. If a litigant on the cusp of self-representation knew at the start of the case how much it was going to cost for each phase then he may well opt for representation.  The benefits of representation are too obvious to spell out extensively. Far more cases with the benefit of representation settle, with the resultant avoidance of the legacy of heartache that contested litigation engenders. Those cases that do fight will be on rational and properly pleaded justiciable issues. The lengthy delays in the court system caused by the explosion in self-representation may be reduced.</p>

The Jackson reforms, now enacted in large part by LASPO, and rules of court which are to be introduced in April 2013 seek to rein in such costs. Like the Woolf reforms before them, it is unlikely that they will be the end of the story. Unlike the Woolf reforms, they are not going to be adversely effected by the introduction of unconnected reforms to CFAs, although the reforms to legal aid may well play the part which CFAs played for the Woolf reforms. But we cannot be certain.  What can be said with certainty is that by building on the Woolf reforms, and undoing the negative effects of the current CFA system, the Jackson reforms represent the boldest attempt to cure our costs problem yet attempted. Should they fail to reduce costs, it seems to me that we will face a stark choice: the rejection of the English costs rule and the adoption of either a US-style costs rule or a German-style fixed costs regime."</p>

FPR rule 28.3(5) prescribes no order as to costs as the normal order following a final hearing; this rule has been in effect since 2006. That was our Jackson reform, seven years ahead of its time. Yet, as this case shows only too clearly, that reform has done nothing to curb the disfiguring impact of excessive costs. This is why we must now look to fixed pricing and judicial costs capping, in my opinion. I would also add that the merit of arbitration in a proceeding such as this would in my opinion take off if that service offered fixed pricing as a standard feature. </p>

Whether the shareholders or the company would pay &#163;2m is another matter. I will discuss this aspect below. The agreed figure is to be contrasted with the absurd figure of &#163;400,000 that the husband advanced in his Form E, which was vouched by a very full accountant's report (which he wrongly appended thereto without the court's permission). It is to be contrasted with the figure of &#163;3m advanced in the schedules prepared by the wife's team for the opening in this case. That figure of &#163;3m was the very top end of her valuer's bracket (the bottom being &#163;1.925m). It can be seen how the failure to appoint a SJE resulted in extremely partial and partisan positions being adopted by the experts who seem to have forgotten that their first duty is to the court and that, notwithstanding the large fees they are paid, their role is not to act as a gladiator on behalf of their client. I appreciate, obviously, that a valuation is never anything more that a mere prediction of what a willing buyer might pay for the asset in question, and that as the great atomic physicist Niels Bohr memorably stated "prediction is very difficult, especially about the future", but, even so, I cannot begin to understand, having regard to the figures in the accounts and records of the company, how &#163;400,000 or &#163;3m could have been tenably or responsibly advanced as a fair value for this shareholding.   </p>

Apart from the special situation obtaining in F Ltd (which I have explained above) I regard it as bordering on heretical that a valuation should amount to an amalgam of the two separate techniques of net asset appraisal and earnings multiplication. I would expect there to be specific evidence of transactions of comparable businesses having taken place where a buyer has paid a goodwill premium over a net asset valuation. There was none. Reference was made to F Ltd having paid for "goodwill" when it acquired another business in recent times but I am satisfied that this was an after the event accounting entry to satisfy the requirements of double entry bookkeeping. I am wholly unsatisfied that a purchaser would pay a premium on top of net assets for S Ltd especially in the current circumstances where T Ltd has abandoned S Ltd as a supplier. </p>

For example there is within his investment portfolio an empty eight bedroom house worth around &#163;200,000 which is now run down and virtually derelict.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">My figure of &#163;2m for the value of the husband's F Ltd shares is not very firm. It is based on a mere prediction. At court on 1 October 2014 the husband finally accepted that the shares would have to be sold, yet inexplicably he did not even start any discussions with his fellow shareholders until the week before this hearing, which commenced on 28 October 2014. Those fellow shareholders have not even had a discussion about this between themselves, let alone a discussion around the structure about how the husband's shares should be bought. In evidence it emerged that the most fiscally sensible structure would be for the company to buy the husband's shares and for the two other shareholders to lend the company the money to do so. The other shareholders have made an offer to buy the husband's shares for &#163;1.25m, and one of them in evidence before me stated that he was not minded to shift from that. The shareholders' agreement and the articles of association provide for a pre-emptive right of purchase by the other shareholders without a discount and in default permit a sale to an external third party provided that the purchaser enters into a comparable agreement. It was plain to me that serious negotiations need to take place between the husband and his fellow shareholders.</p>

The net assets of the business excluding the packing arm are (on revaluations) about &#163;5.6m. The packing arm is reasonably valued on the multiplication of earnings basis at about &#163;900,000 giving an overall value of &#163;6.5m. In such circumstances a price of &#163;2m for the husband's shares is fair, if somewhat conservative.</p>

Following the sale of the F Ltd shares at &#163;2m gross (&#163;1.8m net) the wife would have &#163;782,500 in cash and pensions outside the value of her home.  Even if the shares were sold for only &#163;1.2m net she would have &#163;482,500. On the Duxbury formula these sums would provide index linked net spendable annual amounts of about &#163;37,000 and &#163;24,000 respectively. In addition the wife will receive the agreed figure of &#163;3,000 per child per annum as child support and child benefit of about &#163;1,800. Further, the wife plainly has a modest earning capacity. She accepted as much in evidence. I assess this at &#163;12,000 per annum. The agricultural tie requires the house to be occupied by someone employed in agriculture. If it cannot be shifted the wife will need to get a small job in something like a farm shop to avoid being in violation of the tie. </p>

The majority of the hearing before me was an attritional war about who was responsible for running up &#163;920,000 of costs. It is worth reflecting on what those costs were <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> spent on. As I have explained, they did <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> extend to instructing an SJE in relation to the F Ltd shares at an early stage. What happened was that the husband wrongly appended a full expert report about the value of the shares to his Form E. It is of course permissible to append a short accountant's letter justifying a Form E figure; this is what the Form requires. But it is quite wrong to append a very full expert report and yet more wrong then to turn up at the first appointment and argue that that report should stand as the only evidence about the value of those shares and that the wife should be confined merely to asking questions of the husband's expert. For that is what happened here. In those circumstances the Deputy District Judge was persuaded, wrongly in my view, to allow the wife to have her own expert. He should have ordered that a SJE be instructed.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">For this case I was presented with an essential reading bundle, four further "court" bundles, four "additional documents" bundles, a bundle produced by the husband's team, and two further ring files which came into existence during the course of the case. 12 bundles in all. Many of them were so full that they could hardly be opened. I placed yellow stickers on all the pages outside the essential reading bundle. There cannot have been more than 50. Yet to look at them (sometimes many times) it was necessary in each instance for a file to be taken up, opened, put away (and so on) by me, the lawyers and the witness. The waste of time was simply prodigious. The entire archive had to be taken to and fro. It was all totally unnecessary where all of the documents used in this case could have comfortably fitted in one file in compliance with the one bundle rule. I do not accept that the demands of a busy practice are a justifiable excuse for a contemptuous disregard of the rule. Nor do I accept the argument, which I have heard, that it is unfair for an applicant to have to identify her "killer" documents by placing them in the single bundle in circumstances where non-disclosure is rife and where confrontation with a document buried deep in (say) File 19 will expose dishonesty. This is, with respect, an absurd argument. If the killer document exposes fraud let it be shown at the earliest opportunity so that a settlement might be achieved. This argument smacks of playing games. I also deprecate a practice of circumvention of which I have become aware. That is for the lawyers for both sides to agree a single "core" bundle and, in addition, an archive of many volumes of expensively prepared secondary or background material. This archive is then brought to trial in the confident belief and expectation that the trial judge will grant permission pursuant to PD27A para 5.1 at the final hearing itself to use documents from the archive. This is no better than the old regime which the new prescription was designed to stamp out. Para 5.1 expects that a direction for permission to use more than one bundle is obtained before, not at, the final hearing. It is possible, of course, that, unexpectedly, further documents may be need to be deployed at the final hearing; but the starting point, and the usual finishing point must be that all the relevant documents should be in the single bundle. To describe the single bundle as the "core" bundle suggests that there will inevitably be other documents in further bundles outlying the core. That is the wrong approach. There should only be one single bundle unless prior permission to use more than one has been obtained.       </p>

I recall that in his minatory and mordant judgment of <span style="font-style:italic">Re X and Y (Bundles)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2008/2058" uk:canonical="[2008] EWHC 2058 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWHC 2058 (Fam)</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 2 FLR 2053" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 2 FLR 2053</ref> Munby J threatened practitioners who defied the then practice direction about bundles with dire consequences. Since then the practice direction has been incorporated within the FPR and reissued on 10 April 2014 in its current form incorporating the one bundle rule. But routinely the profession pays no attention to it. Again, it is no use the courts feebly issuing empty threats. I intend to draw this also to the President's attention with a view to him raising this further pressing matter as a matter of urgency with the Family Procedure Rules Committee.  Perhaps it will be necessary for him to set up a special court before which delinquents will be summoned to explain themselves in open court, just as delinquent practitioners in the Administrative Court are summoned before the President of the Queen's Bench Division pursuant to the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">R (on the application of Hamid) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2012/3070" uk:canonical="[2012] EWHC 3070 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWHC 3070 (Admin)</ref>.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Subparagraph (f) is highly important. This requires the court to ensure that its primary disposition, which will usually be strongly influenced by considerations of need, is not undone and subverted by a costs order. It was for this reason that the <span style="font-style:italic">Calderbank</span> principle was abolished (see rule 28.3(8) where <span style="font-style:italic">Calderbank</span> offers are made inadmissible). Some quarters are calling for the <span style="font-style:italic">Calderbank </span>principle to be reintroduced (and it is true that the current rules permit it to be used for certain proceedings other than the final hearing of an ancillary relief claim). For my part I will fight its reintroduction to the last ditch. In my opinion it would be retrograde and unconscionable to allow a carefully crafted disposition to be turned upside down by virtue of a without prejudice letter produced after judgment has been given. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied that in certain respects the husband has been guilty of litigation misconduct which the court should, in principle, take into account under subparagraph (e). I am generally in agreement with the criticisms made of him in the second half of Miss Harrison QC's written final submissions. It is unnecessary to spell them out here. Some of his misconduct I have already detailed.  Most of it happened before the FDR. I remain completely baffled as to how the professionals on each side incurred &#163;700,000 of costs following the FDR. It seems to me to have been an unbridled exercise where the only commodity being charged for was time rather than product. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, having regard to subparagraph (f), I cannot reflect the husband's misconduct other than symbolically. Miss Harrison seeks an order that he pays 75% of the wife's costs. Ignoring amounts disallowed on assessment this would require the husband to pay &#163;276,750. It would elevate the wife's capital position to &#163;1,350,250 and depress the husband to &#163; 614,750. This would be grossly unfair especially where I regard the wife as having litigated almost as disproportionately as the husband.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment the husband's delinquency should be reflected by a costs order of &#163;50,000 (inclusive of VAT) to be paid from his share of the FF share sale proceeds. The upshot will be that from the pre-costs starting point of &#163;2,885,000 the wife will receive &#163;1,123,500 (38.9% of the assets); the lawyers and experts will receive &#163;920,000 (31.9%); and the husband &#163;841,500 (29.2%). These figures speak for themselves. Such a result should not be allowed to happen again. </p>
