	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a temporary but fundamental shift in the manner in which the Family Court and the Family Division of the High Court hear and determine family cases.  Namely, a very marked increase in the use of remote hearings conducted by means of electronic communications platforms.  That temporary shift has resulted in the court having to consider, in each case, whether that case is suitable for a remote or, increasingly commonly, a hybrid hearing (whereby certain parties and / or their lawyers attend the court building while others attend the hearing by remote means) or whether the case should be adjourned for what may be an extended period until a fully face to face hearing can be achieved.  That, to an extent, is the question in this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The proceedings were issued on 19 October 2018 and have been the subject of very considerable delay for reasons that I will come to.  The matter is now currently listed for an adjourned part heard final hearing commencing on 13 July 2020 at the Manchester Civil Justice Centre with a time estimate of ten days.  By reason of the size of the largest courtrooms in that court building the case will be capable of being heard fully face to face whilst at the same time complying with the current social distancing requirements put in place by the Government.  The facilities in the courtroom at Manchester will also permit, as a continency plan, a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; hearing to take place whereby one or more parties can attend the hearing in Manchester remotely without having to step inside the court building.  The father, however, now applies to further adjourn the part heard final hearing until such time a fully face to face hearing can take place in Preston, for reasons that I will come to. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The hearing of this adjournment application has been conducted remotely.  In determining the father&#8217;s application for an adjournment I have had the benefit of written and oral submissions from leading and junior counsel and have read the relevant documents in the electronic bundle.  Given the issues raised by the father&#8217;s application to further adjourn the part heard final hearing and the difficulties of delivering an <span style="font-style:italic">ex tempore </span>judgment over a remote link, I reserved judgment for a short period.  This judgment is of some length in circumstances where the position in this case is somewhat unusual and where there have been recent developments in the guidance applicable to the court&#8217;s decision. It is important to make clear however, that most judgments dealing with adjournment applications of this nature will not need to descend to the level of detail set out below.  Having regard to the factors that I have summarised at paragraph [45] below, I am satisfied that the father&#8217;s application to adjourn the part heard final hearing must be refused for the reasons I now proceed to set out. </p>

Having regard to the totality of the evidence in the case, the local authority now seeks findings that C&#8217;s injuries were inflicted on him by either his mother or his father or both his parents.  In addition, the local authority relies on welfare concerns arising out of the parents&#8217; alleged use of drugs, their emotional and mental health, their alleged hostility to professional intervention and their alleged inability to work openly and honestly with professionals. </p>

On 7 November 2018 His Honour Judge Duggan timetabled the matter to a final hearing commencing on 25 March 2019 with a time estimate of five days.  The pre-hearing review was held on 8 March 2019 and the final hearing commenced as timetabled and on time before HHJ Duggan on 25 March 2019.  However, on 26 March 2019 the final hearing had to be stopped by reason of the father having collapsed on the first day of the hearing and being conveyed to hospital by ambulance.  Having received confirmation that the father was not well enough to attend court HHJ Duggan re-timetabled the matter for a further final hearing commencing on 16 October 2019. </p>

Upon enquiry the father&#8217;s general practitioner considered that he had capacity to litigate and would possibly be able to attend court.  The mental health crisis team considered that the father was suffering from anxiety and that it would be advantageous for him to seek treatment for this and to attend court if he were able.  Upon the father&#8217;s counsel and solicitor visiting him they concluded that the father wished to participate in the final hearing but had very marked anxieties about doing so.  Within this context, the father&#8217;s legal team concluded that he would not be able to participate in a final hearing without the services of an intermediary.  </p>

Dr Waheed concluded that the father did have litigation capacity, but was suffering from recurrent depression of moderate severity.  Dr Waheed considered that the father&#8217;s symptoms rendered him vulnerable and to an extent restricted his ability to fully understand any new information or utilise this information to make his decisions. An intermediary report was also directed and Sarah McPhillips, registered intermediary reported on 25 November 2019 that the father would require intermediary support in advance of, and throughout the final hearing.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This matter having been re-allocated to me, I listed it for a final hearing before me in Preston from 16 March 2020 with a time estimate of three weeks.  The hearing commenced on 16 March 2020 with both the mother and the father in attendance, the father having the benefit of support from an intermediary.  Within this context, and as Ms Meachin has pointed out during her oral submissions at this hearing, the extensive efforts put in place by HHJ Duggan to support the father to attend the final hearing in Preston before me were thus successful in facilitating his participation in that hearing, notwithstanding the symptoms generated by his depression and anxiety.  This made the subsequent impact of world events beyond the control of the court and the parties all the more frustrating, particularly in the context of it having been necessary to abandon two previous final hearings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The final hearing that commenced on 16 March 2020 took place in Court Two at Sessions House in Preston.  The courtroom is small and was required to accommodate at least 18 people for the final hearing, supplemented at regular intervals by live witnesses, including active duty paramedics and the doctors who treated C.  Within this context all those participating, save perhaps for myself, were seated in very close physical proximity to each other.   On 3 March 2020 the Government had published its Coronavirus Action Plan. That plan made clear that the virus had the potential to spread extensively, that the then current data appeared to show that all were susceptible to catching the disease, that a minority of people who were infected would develop complications severe enough to require hospital care and suggested that close contact with others infected could lead to the further spread of infection.  On 16 March 2020 the Prime Minister announced that everyone should stop non-essential contact with others, stop all unnecessary travel and work from home where possible and avoid all unnecessary social contact.  Within the foregoing context, and having regard to the conditions in the courtroom that I have identified above, I took the decision at lunchtime on 17 March 2020 to adjourn the hearing part heard due to my concerns that I was unable to ensure the safety from infection of the court staff, the parties and their legal teams having regard to the information that had by then become available. </p>

As will be seen below, following the Prime Minister&#8217;s announcement on 16 March 2020, guidance was promulgated by the President of the Family Division on 19 March 2020 concerning the conduct of remote hearings in family cases.  Subsequent to my offer of a remote fixture for the part heard final hearing I was informed that the parties could not agree whether the case was suitable for a remote hearing, with both parents contending strenuously that it was not.

On 14 May 2020 my clerk confirmed to the parties that the Manchester Civil Justice Centre could accommodate the case in a courtroom in Manchester large enough to facilitate a properly socially distanced face to face hearing.  Enquiries continued with respect to the Combined Court Centre in Preston but it quickly became apparent that, due to current pressures on the court estate in Lancashire arising out of the fact that the requirement to implement social distancing means that the courts cannot operate at full capacity, and the fact that the resulting limited court space is required to be used by all jurisdictions, the Combined Court in Preston would not be able to accommodate the hearing. This remains the position. Sessions House in Preston is obviously inappropriate for a fully face to face final hearing in this case for the very reasons that caused this case to be adjourned part heard on 17 March 2020.   </p>

The case concerned ongoing care proceedings issued in April 2019, with the subject child having been the subject of private law proceedings for a considerably longer period.  The question before the President was whether it was appropriate for the fully contested final hearing in the matter (which, as the President observed, involved a particular form of child abuse which requires exquisite sensitivity and skill on the part of the court) to be conducted by way of a remote hearing.  Within this context, and having made clear that because a hearing can be conducted remotely does not in any way mean that the hearing must be conducted in that way, in deciding that case was not suitable for a remote hearing the President observed as follows at [24]: </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;The decision whether to hold a remote hearing in a contested case involving the welfare of a child is a particularly difficult one for a court to resolve. A range of factors are likely to be in play, each potentially compelling but also potentially at odds with each other. The need to maintain a hearing in order to avoid delay and to resolve issues for a child in order for her life to move forward is likely to be a most powerful consideration in many cases, but it may be at odds with the need for the very resolution of that issue to be undertaken in a thorough, forensically sound, fair, just and proportionate manner. The decision to proceed or not may not turn on the category of case or seriousness of the decision, but upon other factors that are idiosyncratic of the particular case itself, such as the local facilities, the available technology, the personalities and expectations of the key family members and, in these early days, the experience of the judge or magistrates in remote working. It is because no two cases may be the same that the decision on remote hearings has been left to the individual judge in each case, rather than making it the subject of binding national guidance.&#8221; </p>

A number of cautionary statements have been made regarding reliance on demeanour when assessing the credibility and reliability of oral evidence (see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1147" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1147" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1147</ref> at [11] and [12] and <span style="font-style:italic">Sri Lanka v the Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2018/1391" uk:canonical="[2018] EWCA Civ 1391" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWCA Civ 1391</ref> at [40] and [41]).  Within this context, court&#8217;s impression of a parent, and its assessment of the credibility and reliability of that parent, should coalesce around matters such as the internal consistency of their evidence, its logicality and plausibility, details given or not given and the consistency of their evidence when measured against other sources of evidence (including evidence of what the witness has said on other occasions) and other known or probable facts.  Beyond this however, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (A Child: Remote Hearing)</span> the President also considered the following matters important when considering the efficacy of a remote hearing: </p>

The judge who undertakes such a hearing may well be able to cope with the cross-examination and the assimilation of the detailed evidence from the e-bundle and from the process of witnesses appearing over Skype, but that is only part of the judicial function. The more important part, as I have indicated, is for the judge to see all the parties in the case when they are in the courtroom, in particular the mother, and although it is possible over Skype to keep the postage stamp image of any particular attendee at the hearing, up to five in all, live on the judge's screen at any one time, it is a very poor substitute to seeing that person fully present before the court. It also assumes that the person's link with the court hearing is maintained at all times and that they choose to have their video camera on. It seems to me that to contemplate a remote hearing of issues such as this is wholly out-with any process which gives the judge a proper basis upon which to make a full judgment.&#8221; </p>

Apparent potential unfairness which justified a case being adjourned for what was hoped to be a relatively short period of time, must now be re-evaluated against this much longer timescale. The need to achieve finality in decision-making for children and families, the detrimental effect of delay and the overall impact on the wider system of an ever-growing backlog must form important elements in judicial decision making alongside the need for fairness to all parties. More positively, experience of remote hearings in the past two months has identified steps that can be taken to reduce the potential for unfairness (a number are listed at paragraph 49 below and more are set out at paragraph 5.19 of MacDonald J&#8217;s Guide to the Remote Family Court), enabling cases to proceed fairly when previously they may have been adjourned.&#8221; </p>

Now that we are facing many more months of straitened resources it is likely that nettles will need to be grasped for the sake of the child&#8217;s welfare, with final hearings fixed for remote or hybrid determination, and with steps taken to maximise the fairness of the process.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The parents&#8217; reluctance to attend the face to face hearing centres on the need to travel to Manchester for each day of the hearing.  The mother&#8217;s objection in this regard is based squarely on the anxieties caused by having to use public transport during the course of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.  The father&#8217;s anxieties are expressed more generally but also focus on the impact of the pandemic, Ms Meachin and Ms Hendry pointing out that the father&#8217;s prior travel to Manchester occurred prior to the pandemic taking hold.  However, and in this context, not only has the court made available a risk-assessed courtroom enabling all participants in this case to take part in the court hearing by physical attendance in a socially distanced courtroom before the judge but the local authority has made clear that it will if necessary fund private transport for the parents by way of taxi to and from Manchester.  This would not only negate the need for the parents to use public transport, but would allow them to attend a face to face hearing at which they would have face to face access to and the support of members of their respective legal teams and would allow the father to have the support of his intermediary in the courtroom.  Finally, I note that the court has no up to date medical evidence before it demonstrating that the father is unable to travel to Manchester by reason of anxiety and, indeed he has in the past travelled not only to Manchester but also to London, albeit before the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

The father cannot attend the face to face hearing listed in Manchester by reason of his anxiety.  Therefore, the choice facing the court is between holding a hybrid hearing as a contingency plan at which he, unusually in the context of that format, is the party attending remotely or further adjourning the final hearing for a live hearing in Preston and the application of the factors set out at paragraph [45] above clearly shows that it is this latter course that is appropriate.  However, applying those factors to the facts of this case I regret that I cannot accept that line of argument.   </p>

Within the context of an adjournment application, the most appropriate lens through which to examine the welfare of C is the statutory duty to have regard to the general principle that delay in determining the question is likely to prejudice his welfare.  C is now 21 months old.  He has spent the entirety of his young life in foster care.  This case has been adjourned three times and is now fast approaching its second anniversary.  Within this context, and in the context of the well-known adverse effect of delay and uncertainty on children, it is axiomatic that C has an urgent welfare need for his future to be settled in order that he can settle either in the certain care of his parents and wider family or in the certain care of his current foster carers and develop physically, emotionally and educationally in that settled context.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">A decision to adjourn these proceedings to await a face to face hearing in Preston would result in further and extensive delay in meeting this urgent welfare need.  This would be entirely antithetic to C&#8217;s welfare.  Contrary to the submission of the parents, the nature of C&#8217;s current placement will not eliminate or significantly mitigate the effect of delay.  At best, such an assertion is only true if the court decides that it is not in C&#8217;s best interests to return to the care of his parents and then only to an extent.  In that context, further delay will still continue to place the current foster care placement under stress, making it potentially more difficult to effect the transition into permanency if that is the outcome the court ultimately favours.  If the court determines that C should return to the care of his parents then effecting that rehabilitation becomes more difficult with each day that passes and C builds an ever closer attachment to his foster carers. Indeed, the duty contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> is there precisely to avoid a situation whereby a child who, on investigation, should be in the care of his or her parents is deprived of that care for a moment longer than necessary. More generally, to expose C to uncertainty for months longer is plainly antithetic to his welfare. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There is in this case also a further dimension to the detrimental impact of delay.  The court is required in this case to make findings of fact.  That exercise will rely in part on an examination of the recollection of events by the parents and others and on determining the credibility of the account of the parents.  The parents <span style="font-style:italic">and </span>C have a right to a fair trial under Art 6.  Within the foregoing context, continued further delay will risk prejudicing a fair trial as the events with which the court is concerned continue to recede into the distance and memories dull.  In this context I agree with Mr Rowley that the well-known aphorism that justice delayed is justice denied is particularly apt. </p>

Within this context, and where the father and mother contend that the case cannot be dealt with justly by way of a hybrid hearing as a contingency should they continue to refuse to attend the fully face to face hearing that has been arranged, it is necessary to identify the welfare issues involved, to evaluate the extent to which a remote or hybrid hearing will provide the court with a proper basis upon which to make a full judgment and to consider the steps that can be taken to reduce the potential for unfairness by enabling the cases to proceed fairly when previously it may have been adjourned. </p>

Thereafter, and dependent on the outcome of that fact finding exercise, the court is required to determine whether C should return to the care of his parents or be placed permanently away from them.  The decisions the court is required to take are amongst the most serious to be considered by any court in this jurisdiction.  Within this context, and if it is possible within the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I accept that in this case the optimal method for deciding these issues is a fully face to face hearing.  That is now what the court has set up at the Manchester CJC in July.

I accept that, to date, a hybrid hearing has ordinarily involved lay parties attending court to give evidence whilst other aspects of the hearing continue remotely as a means of addressing certain disadvantages of remote hearings and this is the manner in which a hybrid hearing is characterised in <span style="font-style:italic">The Family Court and COVID-19: The Road Ahead</span>.  However, there is nothing in principle preventing, where necessary, a hybrid hearing operating the other way round as a contingency, in this case if the parents continue to refuse to attend the fully face to face hearing that has been arranged, provided such a hybrid hearing can be achieved fairly.  In the particular circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that it can.   </p>

The court will keep the fairness of the proceedings under ongoing review and the parents benefit from the right to seek permission to appeal if they contend the procedure adopted has been unfair. Further, some three months into the temporary widespread use of remote hearings in the family jurisdiction both the court and those appearing before it have extensive experience and confidence in using the technology required to orchestrate a successful remote or hybrid hearing if necessary.  Finally, for reasons I will come to, it should be possible in this case to ensure that each parent will be appropriately supported by at least one member of their legal team and, in the case of the father, his intermediary if one or both of the parents chooses not to attend the face to face hearing. </p>

Further, I accept that the father in particular has difficulties with anxiety which the court is duty bound to address by reason of the requirements set out in FPR 2010 Part 3A.  All parties accept and the court has directed that the father have the services of an intermediary throughout the proceedings.

In this regard I note that, beyond the assessments provided by Dr Waheed and the intermediary, there is no medical evidence before the court demonstrating that the father&#8217;s anxiety renders him unable to participate in a remote hearing. More importantly however, notwithstanding the father&#8217;s vulnerabilities I am satisfied that in this case that it is possible to take steps to ensure that a hybrid hearing conducted as a contingency should the parents continue to refuse to attend the fully face to face hearing that has been arranged is conducted fairly. </p>

The provision of the contingency arrangements canvassed at this hearing, whereby if the parents continued to refuse to attend the face to face hearing they could attend a location or locations away from their home but in Preston with at least one of their lawyers and, for the father, his intermediary will, I am satisfied, ensure that the parents have access to legal advice and support, can give instructions during the course of the hearing and can be supported to use the required technology to participate in the hearing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Whilst it can be argued that this latter approach is not completely optimal when compared to the option of a fully face to face hearing in Preston, that argument falls to be evaluated against both the fact that the court has already set up a fully face to face hearing in Manchester and the length of the delay that would result in this case if the court adjourned the matter until such time as a fully face to face hearing could be effected in Preston.  As I have made clear, following extensive investigations undertaken by the court, and having regard to the duty on the court to allot to the case an appropriate share of the court's resources, while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases, evaluated in the context of the limitations placed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the resources currently available to give effect to fully face to face hearings, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the likely timescales for a fully face to face hearing is such that a hearing of this nature is unlikely to be achievable before late 2020 and possibly early 2021.  Balancing the effect of such a delay against the disadvantages of a hybrid hearing conducted as a necessary contingency in the event that the parents continue to refuse to attend the fully face to face hearing that has been arranged, I am satisfied that, provided the steps to ensure a fair hybrid hearing that I have outlined are taken, the consequences of that delay far outweighs the disadvantages of holding, as a necessary contingency, the type of hybrid hearing I have described. </p>
