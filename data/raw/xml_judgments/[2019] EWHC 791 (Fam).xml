	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On 1 August 2018 the father filed an appeal against those findings and renewed his application for permission to appeal. On 13 August 2018 Mrs Justice Knowles granted permission to appeal on all grounds and without conditions. A time estimate of one day was given for the hearing of the appeal which for reasons which I am unclear about was listed for January 2019; one year since the fact-finding had been undertaken; albeit only 6 months since the judgment. The delay that has plagued the parties and the child in the resolution of this litigation is staggering. In preparation for that hearing the parties filed an appeal bundle which comprised some 8 lever arch files. In addition the court was informed that an audio-visual recording of the child&#8217;s ABE interview would need to be viewed by the judge hearing the appeal. The view was taken that a one-day time estimate was insufficient in the circumstances and the matter was adjourned to a two-day hearing on the 14 and 15 March. One day was allowed for judicial reading and one day for the hearing of submissions and the delivery of judgment. On 13 March a &#8216;Suggested Reading List&#8217; was submitted by counsel. This appeared to comprise of several thousand pages of material which together with audio-visual material would have taken several days to read. I therefore directed the parties to file a list of &#8216;Essential reading&#8217; which it would be possible to undertake in the one day allowed. Unfortunately when the document was supplied it was the same list of suggested reading now entitled &#8216;agreed suggested essential reading list&#8217; but highlighting documents requiring somewhere between 20 and 30 hours of reading excluding the parties&#8217; Skeleton Arguments or the audio-visual material. I hardly need to say how deeply unhelpful this has been in seeking to prepare for the appeal. It is incumbent on the legal representatives of the parties to identify those documents which the judge <span style="font-weight:bold">MUST </span>(hence the word Essential) read in the time allowed for reading and to provide a list which can be undertaken in that time. If the parties consider that the reading time allowed is wholly insufficient they should notify the court. Alternatively they should tailor the list of Essential Reading to fit within the time allowed. Bearing in mind an appeal is a review of the first instance decision not a rehearing and bearing in mind the appellate approach to challenges to findings of fact made at first instance it should be perfectly possible to identify a manageable list of essential reading. Belatedly the parties did agree some essential reading which I undertook along with viewing the ABE interview. </p>

Ms Hendry produced a detailed annex in the form of an annotated chronology which she relied upon to demonstrate that the judgment of 11 July 2018 </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">had not in fact applied the correct approach to the determination of the allegations and had not taken into account or given due weight to highly relevant evidence and had given undue weight to one specific part of the evidence, namely the child&#8217;s allegations made in May 2017. She argued that the judge did not return to the reasons that he gave for dismissing the allegations in January 2017 or explain why those conclusions were now outweighed by the new evidence.  She made brief submissions in support of grounds 2(ii) and 3. In respect of ground 2(ii) she argued that if the judge had focused on the events of 15 November and 13 December this would have ensured that the evidence of those 2 events was properly taken into account. She also argued that had the judge determined the issue of whether the mother was aware prior to November 2015 that the father was accustomed to washing the child after she had been to the toilet that it would have had a very significant relevance to her credibility or lack thereof. Drawing in part on this Ms Hendry argued that the judge had focused on peripheral issues which went to the father&#8217;s credibility and had ignored central issues which went to the mother&#8217;s credibility. As a result she argued he reached a conclusion that was inconsistent with his previous conclusions (and which was unexplained) and which was flawed. </p>

He was, she argued, ideally placed to see the case in its full evidential context. She referred to the fact that he had had lengthy and detailed written submissions from each of the parties at the conclusion of fact-finding Two. She submitted that both the judgment of January 2017 and July 2018 contained comprehensive reviews of the evidence, identified the relevant law and the approach that mandated and demonstrated the application of that approach to the evidence. She submitted that he had considered all of the relevant issues, that he had taken all relevant evidence into account and that he had not given undue weight to the child&#8217;s account in May 2017. She submitted that the combination of the evidence from the child to the contact centre worker and in her ABE interview together with the change in the credibility of the parties was more than sufficient to justify the change in the ultimate conclusion that he reached on the allegations. She observed that he is amongst the most experienced family court circuit judges and has undoubtedly heard numerous cases of this type. Decisions on the credibility of witnesses are part of his everyday function. Ms Giz also said that many of the complaints now made about the judgment were not made at the time when clarification of the judgment was sought. She submitted that if I considered there were matters that the judge failed to address that it would be possible to invite the judge to further address those matters even at this stage. </p>

Ms Hendry told me that she liaised with Ms Branigan QC overnight and on 12 July, before she had managed to respond, both parties received a further email from the court attaching the supplementary judgment, which also contained the formal refusal of permission to appeal &#8211; backdated to 11 July.

An appellate court should only intervene to set aside a judge&#8217;s findings if there were very clear grounds for concluding that a substantial error or series of errors occurred either during the process of the hearing or particularly within the judicial analysis. </p>

The determination of a sexual abuse allegation where that has been made by an articulate adolescent and which has been followed rapidly by an appropriate ABE interview and the court is able to proceed swiftly to fact-finding within private law proceedings might be considered at the end of the spectrum which allowed for a relatively simple and straightforward analysis. At the other end of the spectrum the case might require a far more sophisticated and nuanced analysis as was required in Re J (above). </p>

The precise nature of the analysis that will need to be undertaken will of course vary from case to case.

Over 3 days the judge heard evidence and written submissions were provided thereafter with judgment being reserved.

It is curious and may be relevant to this appeal that in that first judgment he includes from paragraphs 5 through to 11 a quite detailed summary of the approach specific to the evaluation of sexual abuse allegations made by young children which includes reference to Re E (above) and the 8 points identified by Scott Baker J, as well as the need to consider the climate in which the alleged disclosures were made and its particular importance. This includes the evolution of allegations over time, the family dynamics, the potential for false allegations, the relevance of any previous history of child abuse, the care that needs to be taken when interviewing young children and the potential for ambiguity, misrecollection or misperception as well as an appreciation of the child&#8217;s age, maturity and level of understanding, the necessity for considering consistency of accounts given, the importance of corroboration and the range of possible findings.  </p>

At paragraph 123, he states that determination of most of the disputed issues turns on the credibility of the parents themselves. This must be because most of the evidence which was said to have emerged from the child had come via the mother and because the evidence about the 2 particular occasions when the child was said to have had redness around her labia or vagina came from the parents. She had made no frank allegations to police or social workers although had made various comments and demonstrated behaviours to them and in particular to Mrs Butchers which were potentially relevant in the determination of the sexual abuse allegations. </p>

He concluded that there was insufficient material upon which the court could properly draw any inference adverse to the father. I interpret this to mean that taken in combination, the evidence was insufficient to establish on the balance of probabilities that the child had been sexually abused or that the father was the perpetrator. Having set out the binary rule earlier this conclusion amounts to a determination that the father had not sexually abused the child. </p>

The Springbourne family centre who had been supervising contact had provided a report which identified that contact was pleasant but there was a lack of physical and emotional warmth and that the child was wary of close physical contact with the father. On about 31 March, one of the Cedar workers spoke to the mother about the possibility of unsupervised contact. It appears that the mother was upset by this. </p>

In his conclusions the judge noted that there was no significant criticism made of the interview process.

Part of the mother&#8217;s evidence included entries from a log she was keeping. In January 2017 (so around the time of the judgment in the first fact-finding hearing) she recorded repeated remarks by the child about the father washing her and hurting her and being told to keep it a secret. A further entry on 17 February 2017 records the child complaining of the father washing her and him telling her not to tell her mum and him using his fingers and putting them in her vagina. Further entries appear in May, June, and July 2017. It appears much evidence was given about whether the mother knew about the father routinely washing the child after going to the lavatory. If there was evidence about the events of 15 November 2015 and 13 December 2015 it is not related in any detail. The mother confirmed that she believed there had been sexual abuse and that the child had been asked to keep it a secret. She denied encouraging the child to feel anxious and denied building a case. She alleged the child had displayed sexualised behaviour almost every time other children came around. </p>

It is accepted that the judge correctly set out the approach to fact-finding where allegations of sexual abuse are made by children. The summary contained within Ms Brannigan QC and Ms Hendry&#8217;s skeleton argument is essentially a mirror of the approach set out by HHJ Meston QC in his first fact-finding judgment. In particular Ms Brannigan QC and Ms Hendry focus their criticism on the judge&#8217;s failure to adopt the analytical method for evaluating the weight of a child&#8217;s evidence which is contained in Re E (a minor) (child abuse: evidence) [1991] 1FLR 420. In that Mr Justice Scott Baker identified 8 discrete factors which needed to be borne in mind in evaluating the weight to be attached to a child&#8217;s evidence. </p>

Taken together with the absence of any reference in his &#8216;the principles applicable to fact-finding&#8217; section to the detailed exposition he had set out in his January 2017 judgment this is slightly surprising. Given that the central evidence that had led to the rehearing and that was at the heart of the case he had just heard and given that this was clearly a case of considerable complexity having regard to it being a rehearing one might have expected a clear self reminder of the great care that needed to be taken in assessing the weight to be given to the child's evidence and some of the factors that needed consideration; the need to consider the number of times the child had been interviewed and the diminishing value of further interviews, the age of the child, the great care to be taken in assessing the reliability of adults who report what the child says, the climate in which the disclosures were made and whether they may have been influenced by adult words or behaviour, whether what the child has said is likely to be fact or fiction or a mixture of the two, the consistency of the child's accounts, whether the child's behaviour before and after the disclosures is consistent with the truth of them, whether there is any reliable independent evidence to corroborate what the child has said. Whilst I do not suggest that it is necessary for a judge to give himself a checklist and mechanistically go through it that would of course demonstrate that the issues had been considered and answered. So is it clear from the subsequent paragraphs that that cautious approach in which those markers of reliability were applied or not? </p>

Of course, brevity is absolutely to be applauded. Some cases though do not lend themselves to brevity of analysis.  It seems to me that this case was at the most complex end of the spectrum when it comes to analysis of the evidence as a whole but most particularly in relation to the reliability of the account given by the child. It seems to me it required a comprehensive review of the evidential trail that led from 15 November 2015 through to the ABE interviews in May 2017 in order to illuminate the process by which the child moved from neither making any allegation or demonstrating any trace of unhappiness with the father's behaviour either </p>

It also seems to me that it was incumbent upon the judge to identify that whilst the process within which Ms Taylor elicited the frank allegations of abuse was an innocent one it was a process which was not compliant with the ABE process. The ABE interview whilst uncontroversial in terms of how it was prepared for and conducted has to be viewed against the backdrop of the discussions the child had with Ms Taylor and they against the backdrop of the discussions the child had with her mother. </p>

It is all well and good to say one can assume it has been done but without any real evidence of it is that assumption justified? Of course, the judge was fully aware that the child had moved from not making allegations through to making allegations and hence his judgment asks why that might be. He answers it by identifying that the child has become more confident. I do not think that on the facts of this case that is sufficient. Without suggesting that the whole of the history needed to be repeated in the conclusion section I do consider that some explicit cross-checking was required to demonstrate that the child&#8217;s recent allegations had not been compartmentalised and that they had been subjected to the rigorous scrutiny and contextual analysis that a complex sexual abuse allegation case of this sort required.  </p>

The conclusion section of the judgment HHJ Meston QC does not subject that evidence to any real detailed scrutiny. The evidence is rehearsed and in general terms it is recognised that the allegations emerged in the context of a possible progression onto unsupervised contact but it does not look at that against the backdrop of the earlier history. He does say that it would be quite understandable if the child had come to realise her mother&#8217;s concerns and that it was something her mother disapproved of together with the remaining impact of leading questions asked in April 2016 but that is in looking for theories which explain it rather than identifying the context in which it happened. There are many other points which either could or should have been addressed in relation to the reliability of this evidence.  </p>

If a rule of thumb is that less weight is to be given to later interviews than to earlier interviews the ultimate conclusion that HHJ Meston QC reached was that it was the two latest interviews which were the reliable ones and that the first or earliest were not reliable. When one is inverting the rule of thumb in this way it seems to me that it needs to be supported by a clear analysis of an explanation of why the earlier are unreliable and the later are reliable. I do not think a generalised answer that the child was becoming more confident is a sufficient answer to this point. The evidence relating to what the child said (or didn't say) and her demeanour or behaviour in late 2015 and early 2016 when spoken to by her mother, GP, social worker and police all needed to be carefully scrutinised and set against the context of the later allegations. </p>

Ms Hendry submitted that this in effect reversed the burden of proof and called for the father to provide an adequate explanation. The way it is formulated does tend to suggest that there is no other innocent explanation. Whilst I do not consider that the way it is expressed does amount to a reversal of the burden of proof, in tandem with the absence of express consideration of and a specific finding as to what occurred on each of those dates it has an unfortunate tendency to suggest it is corroboration when it may not be.    </p>

The basis of the change in the judge&#8217;s appraisal of his credibility was largely linked to peripheral issues. However he also identified at paragraph 90 that the father&#8217;s account of his practice of washing the child&#8217;s bottom was undermined by gaps and inconsistencies.

It is asserted that he identified certain issues in the father&#8217;s case, which undermined his credibility but did not do the same in respect of the mother. The father goes on to argue that the failure to determine the issues of prior knowledge of washing and the events of 13 December deprive the judge of conclusions that were central to the determination of the credibility of the parents. I&#8217;m not sure that they are central to determining the credibility of the parties but I do agree with Ms Hendry that the events of 15 November 2015 and 13 December were central; of which see below. Matters of credibility are peculiarly within the remit of a trial judge who has seen and heard the parties. I do not consider that it can be said that the judge&#8217;s assessment of credibility was flawed and inconsistent with the findings previously made but it is perhaps neither here nor there given that I consider that grounds 1 and 2 are established.

My initial reaction to the submission that they were central was to doubt that proposition. Why were they any more central than any of the other numerous allegations within the schedules? Ms Giz submitted that it was implicit that he made findings in favour of the mother on these issues because he rejected the father&#8217;s explanations for the redness and swelling that had been observed. She also submits that it was not essential for him to make findings on every issue. On further reflection though I agree with Ms Hendry&#8217;s submission. Ultimately the judge was considering allegations of sexual abuse.  The Scott schedules had a tendency to obscure that central issue. It seems to me that the way the schedule was drafted did not assist the judge in identifying clearly the facts which were central to the determination of the case. Item 1 on the schedule contains the headline allegation outlined in paragraph 3(i) above. It also identified 2 specific occasions, 15 November 2015 and 13 December 2015 when it was said that the child had returned home with a red and swollen genital area. However the schedule went on to include 7 other sub paragraphs which were better characterised as evidence in support of the general allegation but were included as findings sought thus muddying the water. In relation to item 3 the findings sought were also diffused by 3 sub paragraphs and in relation to item 4 it was diffused by 8 sub paragraphs.  </p>

It has a tendency to suggest that the process which is now being undertaken is whether adding into the scales the additional evidence tips the balance the other way. That it seems to me risks both compartmentalisation and an undue and inappropriate focus on only those new pieces of evidence. The process must involve an overarching consideration of all of the evidence and how each interrelates with the other. Thus what took place in April and May 2017 and the judge&#8217;s views on credibility had to be woven into the overall evidential picture to create a new one rather than putting the picture from January 2017 and the picture from January 2018 alongside each other. Whilst it was open to the judge to interpret the ABE interview as demonstrating a child describing an experience that was a painful reality that conclusion could only be a reliable one if it was plainly set against the backdrop of an appropriately detailed analysis of the path to ABE. Whilst the weight that the judge placed on the ABE may not be in the realms of that which the Court of Appeal criticised in Re J (above) nor based on the presentation alone I am satisfied that because of the flawed analysis of the context in which the April/May 2017 evidence had to be assessed and the absence of focus on the 2 anchor points of 15 November 2015 and 13 December 2015 that paragraph 92 is ultimately a flawed one. Too much weight is placed on the evidence of the child when such weight could not properly be attributed to it without the detailed contextual analysis I have referred to. </p>

Although the allegations are not in themselves unusual or difficult the surrounding penumbra of events and the nature of the litigation made it a complex case. Further the absence of findings on two anchor point events add further substance to the appeal. They led to a situation where undue focus was placed on the recent allegations and weight was placed on them which they could not properly bear.

In the context of the criticism of a wholesale failure to analyse the context of the April/May 2017 evidence I do not think it could sensibly have been the subject of such a request. Still less would it be appropriate now.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Returning to the fact that the Guardian played no role in this complex appeal I would observe that a child is made a party to private law proceedings of this sort because the court has considered it is in their best interests to be a party. I&#8217;m afraid I do not follow why it would be considered that it was not in the child&#8217;s best interests for her Guardian and lawyers to play a role in an appeal in such a critically important matter concerning the child. Assuming (as is the case in this appeal) that the Guardian is taking a neutral position and that they participated at the first instance hearing, is it </p>

Perhaps there were many contributing factors including the over-burdened Scott Schedule, lack of time, the inability to complete the case within its time estimate and the delay in delivery of the judgment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The result of the appeal being allowed has to be that the matter is remitted for further hearing. I do not consider that I am in a position to determine that the evidence from the child from April/May 2017 is so demonstrably unreliable that findings could not be made in reliance upon it. That with respect to Ms Hendry is to invite me to commit the very error that forms the basis of this successful appeal. First of all the reliability of the evidence has to be viewed in the context of how it came into existence (i.e. the Re E approach) but also it has to be placed in the overall evidential landscape. This is not comparable to Re J. It is therefore with considerable regret that I conclude the evidence must be heard again. That will mean that some 3 &#189; years have passed since the events of November and December 2015 and still no conclusive answer is available and still the parties and most particularly the child are unable to progress their lives. The cost both financial and emotional cannot be underestimated but I see no alternative. All matters relating to the sexual abuse allegations will be at large at the remitted hearing. I consider that the remitted hearing should be conducted by a Judge of High Court level and I have provisionally identified a 2 week window before a Deputy High Court Judge commencing on 8 July. The time estimate for the hearing will need to be considered but I very much doubt it could be dealt with in less than 7 days. The matter will have to be listed for a PTR before the allocated judge.  </p>
