If the Court disagrees, her secondary position is to support HK remaining in foster care under a final Care Order. However, she contends that the Court should delay making any final decision for BK until his current foster carer (&#8220;FC&#8221;) has been assessed as a long-term foster carer for him. If that assessment proves positive, the Mother would then seek to argue at a future hearing that long-term foster care rather than adoption is in BK&#8217;s best interests.  She also raises issues as to the frequency of her contact with the boys.  If a Placement Order is made in respect of BK, the Mother contends that it should be accompanied by an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/26" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 26</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> providing for direct contact between BK and HK.</span></p>

She has made observations as to how the transition plan for reducing parental contact should be put into effect which differ somewhat to the LA&#8217;s Care Plans coming into this hearing (but since revised). She joins with the LA in opposing the Mother&#8217;s case that the final decision for BK should be delayed. Also, in line with the evidence all professionals who gave evidence, she recognises the importance of promoting an ongoing sibling relationship between BK and HK, but she does not recommend a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/26" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 26</ref> order providing for direct contact between them.

For reasons I shall explain later, there is now an issue at this welfare hearing as to whether both parents have taken the step of deliberately deleting their phone data to sabotage more recent forensic analysis and, if they have, why they have done so. The background context and Court analysis within the fact-finding judgment is therefore important to understand. </span></p>

Those messages reveal that both parents were under stress and linked this directly to the demands of parenting both BK and HK.  The derogatory language used about both children pervades the phone messages, particularly those of the Father.  On repeated occasions, his messages reveal his feelings of frustration and anger towards the children. Descriptions of how BK was at certain times beg the question why no medical attention was sought for him when he was manifestly unwell. The parents&#8217; messages reveal that BK was very unwell by 11 November 2022. The Mother thought that he should see a doctor. Clearly he needed to. Yet the Father actively dissuaded the Mother from taking that step. This, as I shall explain, is a highly significant part of the overall factual matrix. Internet searches made by both parents add to the picture of his symptoms at various times. Photographs taken by the parents on 9 to 11 January 2023 show BK&#8217;s abnormal head shape (by then like an inverted pyramid) and how ill he looked in the week leading up to his hospital admission.  The description of BK when he was seen at home by the health visitor on the 16 January 2023 is telling. She was very worried about him.  Yet the parents had not sought medical attention for him until her intervention. Following his admission, BK needed emergency medical treatment including a blood transfusion and surgical drainage of fluid to relieve intracranial pressure. I must address why it was that BK got to such a state without either of his parents seeking out medical help sooner&#8221;.</span></p>

What followed, I find was a highly significant exchange of messages &#8230; What stands out is the strong resistance by the Father to the suggestion that BK should be seen by a doctor.  When the Mother wrote that BK kept throwing up his whole bottle, that she did not know what to do, that BK was not feeding and it was worse since the previous day, the Father&#8217;s response was, &#8220;I&#8217;m not an expert am I, look it up&#8221;.  That set the tone for the messages from him that followed.  He did not offer to help, and he showed no concern for how BK was. When the Mother then asked whether he thought that BK needed to see a doctor, just to &#8220;see how he goes&#8221;, the Father&#8217;s reply was resolute:  &#8220;No he doesn&#8217;t need a doctor at all &#8230; not doing that shit again&#8221;.   The messages continued, with the Mother saying she had had enough, BK would not settle and he kept bawling.  When she sent the message, &#8220;Sorry this isn&#8217;t normal&#8221; it is clear how worried she was.  Yet the Father stood his ground, with the blunt response: &#8220;He isn&#8217;t going to a doctor&#8221;.  The Mother persisted in expressing her worries about how BK was.  She said again that it wasn&#8217;t normal, it had been constant since that morning and, &#8220;Crying all day isn&#8217;t normal behaviour is it &#8230; and throwing up milk&#8221;.  The response of the Father was to suggest that they will &#8220;get rid&#8221;. When the Mother asked what he meant, he replied, &#8220;adoption&#8221; adding, &#8220;saves hassle&#8221;.  The Mother again said that something was not right with BK, &#8220;this isn&#8217;t him&#8221;.  Later she added that she could not have BK like this as something was upsetting him and that it broke her heart.  This led the Father to respond, &#8220;Fine take him to the docs. Remember the trouble we had last time you did that&#8221;. The Mother replied, &#8220;Coz he had bruises&#8221;. The Father wrote, &#8220;Do what you want&#8221;. The Mother asked if he was angry.

Notably, the Father made internet searches in the evening, &#8220;baby kicking and flailing arms&#8221; and &#8220;baby arching back and crying&#8221;. In oral evidence, the Father said he could not recall making those searches. I find that he did so because that was what BK was doing.

These were not trivial worries.  BK had a range of significant symptoms. The Mother was not &#8220;overreacting&#8221; as the Father was to tell her both harshly and wrongly. Rather, he was actively seeking to prevent BK receiving the medical care he so clearly needed.  The question is, why?</span></p>

It is striking that he did not express any concern about how BK was during the lengthy exchanges on 11 November 2022 that I have quoted.  Rather, his main focus was on discouraging the Mother from taking BK to see a doctor.  When the Father wrote, &#8220;Not doing that shit again&#8221; and later, &#8220;Remember the trouble we had last time&#8221;, I find that he was referring back to the medical and social services investigation in 2017 when HK sustained bruising aged 4 months.  The reason why that earlier experience weighed on his mind was because he knew the real reason why BK was so unwell. I find that it was because the Father had shaken BK. The Father did not want BK to be seen by a doctor because his symptoms were so concerning that they would be likely to trigger tests and investigations into what was causing them.  A caring parent, who had done nothing wrong but was concerned about how BK was, would have wanted that to happen and for BK to receive medical oversight and care.  But this was the last thing that the Father wanted. His priority was to thwart anyone finding out what was causing BK to be so unwell. To achieve this, he had to avoid BK being taken to see a doctor. Hence the blunt and uncompromising manner in which he resisted the Mother&#8217;s suggestion that BK should be. Her instincts that BK should be seen by a doctor were right.  But she failed to act on them, and the Father got his way. In so doing, he avoided detection (then) of BK&#8217;s intracranial injuries.  The cost to BK was that, for a period in excess of 2 months, he developed progressively enlarging subdural collections which were only discovered when he was admitted to hospital in a very serious condition on 16 January 2023&#8221;.</span></p>

This reinforces my conclusion that HK was telling the truth about his father&#8217;s behaviour. I find that HK was recounting and re-living what he had seen happen to BK.  It was imprinted on HK&#8217;s mind because he had seen and heard something frightening which he knew was not right.  The Father acted angrily and in a way that was highly inappropriate when he pushed BK&#8217;s head down. The Father also reacted angrily to BK crying by putting his hand over BK&#8217;s mouth whilst at the same time saying, &#8220;Shut your mouth&#8221;.  That too was highly inappropriate.  I find that he did this to quell the noise of BK&#8217;s crying because he was annoyed by it. For HK to have witnessed these actions (as I find he did) was emotionally harmful to him. Having viewed the video, I am left in no doubt that HK was both shocked and upset by how his father handled BK and worried about the harmful impact on BK. I find that HK spoke freely and in some detail about what had happened to BK because he wanted people to know what he had seen.  He did not like it and he knew that it was harmful to BK&#8221;.</span></p>

The Mother did not take BK to see a doctor on 11 November 2022 when he clearly needed to see one. She knew of the Father&#8217;s disparaging and angry messages about BK and the stresses he was under. She sought no medical attention for BK even when he was obviously very unwell in the week leading up to 16 January 2023 (analysed further below). In circumstances where she knows that there is a clear body of medical evidence that BK has suffered serious injuries likely to have been inflicted, namely a rib fracture and intracranial injuries, and she knows of the detailed accounts by HK about angry abusive handling of BK by his father, she has remained to this day in a relationship with him.

I reject the Father&#8217;s oral evidence that when, on the afternoon of 12 December 2022, he searched the internet for &#8220;skeletal structure&#8221;, he was doing so for the purposes of artwork. Similarly, I am not satisfied that the Mother has told the truth about the internet searches she made on 6 January 2023 with search terms such as &#8220;baby&#8217;s bones&#8221;, &#8220;newborn baby bone structure&#8221;, &#8220;baby skeleton X-ray&#8221;, &#8220;real baby skeleton&#8221; and &#8220;lump in middle of chest baby&#8221;.

She continued to deny any link with BK&#8217;s injuries, a position that she maintained in oral evidence.  I find that it is no coincidence that such internet searches were made by each of the parents at the beginning and just after the end of the radiological timeframe for BK&#8217;s rib fracture.  I find that both parents are keeping back the true reason for these searches.  As with HK&#8217;s account, this is yet further evidence that the Mother was more aware of the Father&#8217;s ill-treatment of BK than she is prepared to say&#8221;.  </span></p>

Dr Birch stated that, in each of them, BK (then 11 weeks old) looked very unwell.  She described him as looking &#8220;very very ill&#8221; on the photograph taken on 9 January 2023.  This was a full week before the health visitor attended the home on 16 January 2023. Dr Birch&#8217;s view was that BK should have been taken to hospital by his parents on 9 January 2023. He was obviously ill and needed medical attention.  When referred to the photograph dated 11 January 2023 &#8230; Dr Birch again said that BK looked very unwell.  He was pale, his eyes were abnormal and his head had the abnormal (inverted pyramid) shape.  She remarked that such a combination of features would have been &#8220;very alarming for a parent&#8221;, yet no medical attention was sought for BK.</span></p>

The photographs of BK indeed make for alarming viewing and there can be no question that he should have been taken to a doctor by the parents. I add that this conclusion is not just based upon the photographic evidence. Once more, it is reinforced by the parents&#8217; own descriptions of how BK was in this period in the phone messages that passed between them.</span></p>

They exchanged insults and argued with each other.  On 6 January 2023, the Father stated that BK was being &#8220;very very slow&#8221; with his bottle, adding, &#8220;he&#8217;s hardly touched bottle &#8211; he keeps kicking off so he can starve &#8211; cunt&#8221;.  The aggression and hostility towards BK in that message is shocking to read.  So too is the Father&#8217;s message referring to HK the following day:  &#8220;HK is a cunt who gets away with everything, sick of it all&#8221;. The Mother also made her internet searches (analysed at paragraph 225 above) on this date.</span></p>

The Father stated that BK was falling asleep on him and would not touch his bottle. He later said of BK, &#8220;Twat &#8230; went fucking mental when he threw up&#8221;.  When the Mother said that she was &#8220;worried now&#8221; and that &#8220;BK aint been right&#8221;, the Father&#8217;s reply was, &#8220;Why? He&#8217;s just being a cunt&#8221;.  Yet BK clearly was very ill. The Father&#8217;s next message referred to BK having eyes puffed up like he&#8217;d had no sleep.  He then referred to BK having been sick again and &#8220;can&#8217;t put him down its ridiculous&#8221;.  When the Mother expressed her worry about BK being sick, adding &#8220;I worry so much&#8221;, the Father was then dismissive, replying, &#8220;You worry too much, it&#8217;s annoying&#8221;. The Mother said, &#8220;I do as he&#8217;s tiny&#8221; to which the Father replied, &#8220;He&#8217;s fine&#8221;.  For the Father to suggest that the Mother was worrying unduly and to assert that BK was &#8220;fine&#8221; was wholly contradicted by how BK in fact was.  BK was anything but fine.  The messages show that he continued to have problems feeding and he was repeatedly sick.  When these messages are combined with the photographs and Dr Birch&#8217;s expert evidence about what they show, there is no doubt that BK was very unwell and urgently needed medical attention.   </span></p>

By that, he was referring to the GP visit on 20 December 2022.  I note in the submissions on behalf of the Father that it is asserted &#8230; that &#8220;the GP saw BK a matter of days before his admission to hospital&#8221;.   That is not correct.  The gap in time between 20 December 2022 and 16 January 2023 was 27 days. The Father&#8217;s attempt in oral evidence to excuse why BK was not taken to see a doctor prior to 16 January 2023 rang hollow.  The condition that BK was in by 9 January 2023 was very different to how he was when the GP saw him on 20 December 2022. He had an obviously large and abnormal shaped head (as the photographs show).  He was seriously unwell.   </span></p>

The Father behaved then in much the same way as he did on 11 November 2022.  I find that he did so for the same reason.  He knew that BK had once again fallen victim to abusive head trauma at his hands and that was why he was so unwell.  As before, BK was not taken to a doctor as he should have been&#8221;.</span></p>

It is suggested on the Father&#8217;s behalf that the fact that he allowed the health visitor into the home on that date shows that he had nothing to hide.  I cannot accept this.  The health visitor was plainly very worried about BK&#8217;s appearance and how he presented.  Knowing what is now known (from the parents&#8217; messages), BK had been seriously ill for at least a week before then. He was only taken to hospital because the health visitor (having spoken to her supervisor) said that he needed to.  On his admission, he needed emergency medical treatment including a blood transfusion to treat his severe anaemia and aspiration and then surgical drainage of his subdural fluid to relieve the pressure on his brain.  It was a significant failure of parenting by both</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">parents that BK was in such a serious state of ill health before any medical help was sought.  Their false claims to the police in interview, suggesting that there was nothing of any real concern about BK before then, must be viewed in that context.  That it took the words of BK&#8217;s older brother HK, backed up by the content of the parents&#8217; own messages, to reveal what was really happening in the family home shows the level of dishonesty that both parents sought to resort to in an attempt to present a false picture.  This Judgment sets the record straight and provides the factual basis for future planning and welfare decision making for both children&#8221;.</span></p>

The Father was walking away in the opposite direction, but she noticed that on several occasions he turned round and looked at her car. This was also noted by the contact worker who remarked about it to Ms Buckley the next day. The Father&#8217;s behaviour stood out as unusual. Ms Buckley suspected he was waiting for her to drive off so he could then go and see the Mother at the family home. </span></p>

It was an unannounced visit. The Mother presented as flustered, saying she had to go upstairs to turn off her computer as she had been doing training for work. She came back downstairs a few minutes later. Ms Buckley then thought she heard a knock at the door. She told the Mother who went to the door.  Ms Buckley could not hear any conversation, but the Mother shouted to her, &#8220;It&#8217;s next door&#8221;.  Ms Buckley did not see or hear the Father during that visit, but the Mother throughout appeared uneasy and on edge.  Ms Buckley wondered if the parents had been planning to meet up after contact, although she did not challenge the Mother at the time about this.  In oral evidence, both parents denied that this was the case. The Mother said that it was a neighbour at the door with a parcel. The Father denied any plan to meet and said he did not go to the home.  Both parents also denied that there was any significance that the Father called the Mother at 5.30pm that day, a call lasting 56 seconds (see paragraph 57 (iv) below).</span></p>

Ms Shann observed that when the Mother referred to plans to decorate the home she used &#8220;we&#8221; not &#8220;I&#8221; as she spoke.  She was defensive of the Father.  Ms Shann also noted a significant number of items belonging to the Father in the home, including computer equipment in the study room. Ms Shann spoke frankly to the Mother at the penultimate session. Ms Shann told her that she was worried that the Mother was continuing a relationship with the Father and that she needed to be really honest, even if that meant acknowledging things she had not said before.  The Mother&#8217;s response was that the relationship was over, save for a couple of telephone calls with the Father about financial matters. </span></p>

One reason for this was to re-timetable the proceedings to assess the maternal grandparents. I need not say anything in detail about that aspect of the case, save to note that it has been made clear subsequently that the maternal grandparents foresee any future role for them being limited to offering for the Mother and children to come and live with them, and providing general help and support only. Their role would not go beyond that.  They would not be monitoring or supervising the Mother&#8217;s care, nor taking on any primary care role of their own.  However, the second reason for the LA&#8217;s application seeking an urgent hearing has far more significance. The LA sought permission to instruct Evidence Matters (who had conducted the detailed forensic analysis of the parents&#8217; devices at the fact-finding stage) to undertake a forensic analysis of the Mother&#8217;s mobile phone. The application was accompanied by a statement by Ms Buckley referring to the matters set out above.</span></p>

There are open adoptions where the child sees his or her natural parents, but I think it would be fair to say that such arrangements tend not to be seen where the adoptive parents are not in full agreement. Once the Adoption Order has been made the natural parents normally need leave before they can apply for contact.</span></p>

Long term foster care is an extraordinarily precarious legal framework for any child, particularly one as young as LRP. Foster placements, long or short term, do not provide legal security. They can and often do come to an end. Children in long term care may find themselves moved from one home to another sometimes for seemingly inexplicable reasons. Long term foster parents are not expected to be fully committed to a child in the same way as adoptive parents. Most importantly of all in the current context, a long term foster child does not have the same and enduring sense of belonging within a family as does a child who has been adopted. There is no way in which a long term foster child can count on the permanency, predictability and enduring quality of his placement as can a child who has been adopted.&#8221;</span></p>

Unfortunately, they did not feature in the judge&#8217;s analysis. He said that C&#8217;s age weighed heavily but it is not possible to see that he actually took it into account at all in his final evaluation at paragraphs 40-42. The only reference to the benefit of &#8220;a close parental relationship&#8221; is a reference to a relationship with foster carers. In my view, even taking account of the generous latitude due to a trial judge, the failure to consider the benefits of adoption for C was a fundamental error of principle</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. </span></p>

In particular, he said nothing to justify &#8220;the balance which C will have to hold between both parents and foster carers&#8221; or explain why that was a reasonable demand to make of a child of this age. Nor did he consider the ever-present possibility that C would experience changes of foster carers between now and reaching her majority in 2041, and that she would then leave care as a member of a birth family with whom she had never been able to live.</span></p>

Even if one took a gloomy view of these uncertainties, that could only speak in favour of C having a family of her own as soon as possible, so that her adoptive parents could advocate for her and give her the best chance of achieving her full potential.&#8221;</span></p>

The dominant feature of C&#8217;s present situation is, in my view, her particular needs at her very young age. At the heart of the matter, she needs a lifelong family where she can feel that she belongs. I agree with the professional assessment of Ms R and Mr B that this can only happen through adoption. Spending a whole childhood in foster care is absolutely not the same, even if good and permanent carers could be found. The reason why long-term fostering was not looked at more closely by the professionals was because it was obviously a very poor plan for C&#8217;s future. Even if the parents and foster parents do their best, it is an insecure plan for C&#8217;s childhood, and if she was to experience multiple placements, she would be at real risk of suffering irreparable harm.</span></p>

HK has said that, if the Court decides that he cannot return to live with his mother, he would wish to remain with his foster carers.  </span></p>

I have referred already to his experiences in the home which led to his removal into the care of his paternal grandparents.  When BK was discharged from hospital, he was placed in foster care. This means that HK has, since mid-January 2023, lived separately not just from his parents but also his younger brother. Shortly after my fact-finding judgment, HK moved in early December 2023 to foster care, so that his father could move to live in the paternal grandparents&#8217; home.  The LA&#8217;s Care Plan for HK aspires that he remains with those foster carers.  If that plan is approved, there will be an advantage to HK if he is able to remain with those carers.  The Mother&#8217;s case is that HK (and BK) should return to her care.  The key question is whether that can be achieved without compromising their safety and wellbeing. I address that question below.</span></p>

If I approve the LA&#8217;s Care Plan of placement for adoption and an adoptive placement is identified for him, that will involve a further move for BK.  The adoption checklist requires that I address the likely effect on BK throughout his life of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become an adopted person.  I must also address the relationship which BK has with relatives (and relevant others), the likelihood of any such relationship continuing and value to BK of it doing so. In circumstances where the parents&#8217; love for BK and their commitment to seeing him at contact has been emphasised to the Court, this has weighed heavily with me.  So too has the sibling relationship between BK and HK which has been maintained so far through contact. Placing a child for adoption is a very significant step with lifelong consequences. It would sever the legal relationship between BK and his parents and HK.  The advantage to BK of placement for adoption is that he would become part of the adoptive family. Adoption provides lifelong security and permanence.  Given the young age of BK, it is understandable why this plan is urged upon the Court by the LA and the Children&#8217;s Guardian if he cannot be returned to the care of his parents.  I return later to the competing positions on what should happen for BK, both in terms of his placement and in relation to contact.</span></p>

She accepts (rightly) that the findings made are serious and will inevitably feed into the welfare analysis.  But she also points to the more positive observations of professionals when the children were at home, and make the point that, prior to the events concerning BK, the picture does not suggest long standing harmful parenting towards HK. The Mother, to her credit, ensures that contact is an enjoyable experience for her children.</span></p>

I have observed the Mother give evidence for a long time at both the fact-finding hearing and this welfare hearing. She has been asked a great many questions about her own behaviour, the Father and about her children. The Mother presents superficially as if willing to help those who ask her such questions. I can foresee professionals who do not have a detailed knowledge of this case (for example, therapists or course providers who do not know the history and do not challenge her account) might be drawn into her false narrative of events or even feel misplaced sympathy that the children are not living with her.  The difficulty is that the Mother keeps back key information (a trait picked up by Ms Shann). Worst still, as I explain below, she has set out actively to deceive professionals and the Court about matters fundamental to the safety and wellbeing of her children.</span></p>

These are noteworthy as the Mother does not accept a key part of my overall findings. I found, having regard to the detailed narrative given by HK, that the Mother had witnessed BK being forcefully mishandled by the Father by pushing/pulling BK&#8217;s head down, causing BK to cry and scream (see paragraphs 220 and 222-223 of the fact-finding judgment quoted at paragraphs 18 to 20 above). The Mother continues to maintain that what HK said about her presence when this happened was untrue. That links to my finding, which the Mother also rejects, that she has greater knowledge of the Father&#8217;s ill-treatment of BK than she is prepared to say.  When making that finding, I accepted what HK had said. But it went beyond that. The finding was also founded on the evidence that the Mother made internet searches about baby&#8217;s bones etc. at the end of the time range when BK sustained his rib fracture (see paragraph 225 of the fact-finding judgment, quoted at paragraph 21 above).</span></p>

I find that he was acting in that way to check that she was gone before heading in the direction of the family home to visit the Mother. I also accept Ms Buckley&#8217;s description of the Mother appearing flustered and on edge when she arrived unannounced at the home.  I find that the reason for this is that the Mother was expecting the Father, not Ms Buckley, to be at the door. Her first act was to go back upstairs. I find that she did so to try and send a message to the Father warning him that Ms Buckley was there.  When there was then a knock at the door and the Mother answered and called out (so that Ms Buckley could hear) that it was a neighbour, I find that she was likely to be warning the Father to keep away whilst simultaneously seeking to mislead Ms Buckley that the person at the door was someone else. I find that is it no coincidence that the Father called the Mother at 5.30pm that same day.  I find it probable that the call took place shortly after Ms Buckley left, and that what had just happened is likely to have been referred to in that call. </span></p>

They know of no verified incident where a factory reset of a phone has occurred, without user input, for example during a system update. Evidence Matters have likewise provided clear evidence of the steps that must be taken to factory reset a phone and so delete all data, including call and message data.

If, as she asserts, she had experienced her phone losing all her data (without her knowledge or authorisation) a few days earlier as a result of an Apple update, why did she not say so?  Under cross-examination by Ms McCallum, the Mother stated that  not only had the call and message data disappeared, but she also lost photographs of the boys that were taken and stored on the phone and which had not been backed up.  If that were the case, the Mother, by pure coincidence, was then presented with the opportunity to see if Evidence Matters could help to recover such photographs which were of sentimental value to her.  But she said nothing then about this.  I find the reason for this was obvious. She had not suffered an unprecedented and unexplained loss of data.  She had deliberately factory reset the pone. She could not acknowledge that then (and has persisted in her false case ever since) because she knows she did so to conceal what that data would show.</span></p>

There are ways of mitigating some of the more intrusive aspects of foster care, for example by holding meetings about HK away from his school and by delegating day-to-day decision making to his foster carers.

In oral evidence, the Children&#8217;s Guardian expressed some support for that approach and also suggested the phased reduction should be over a longer period than provided for in the Care Plan.   The LA has since reflected on this, and its updated Care Plan provides for a slower reduction and a review at the 7 week point when contact would be taking place at a fortnightly level. The LA still considers, however, that the contact proposed in the plan (12 per year with the Mother and 6 per year with the Father) is in HK&#8217;s best interests in circumstances where there is a need to adjust to a plan of long-term foster care.</span></p>

Although long term foster care is intended to provide permanency, sadly for a significant number of children within the care system, this is not achieved.  There are a range of reasons why this is so.   Ms Shann (with whom the other professional witnesses agreed) spoke of foster cares not becoming too emotionally attached to children in their care, knowing that at some point they may have to move.  Being a foster carer is a &#8220;job&#8221; and a foster carer is free to decide to stop working as such. A change of placement may occur for a range of reasons.  The foster carer&#8217;s circumstances may change (perhaps unexpectedly). They may retire or take on other employment, or have family or other commitments which clash with the demands and requirements of their fostering role.  They may find that the demands placed on them are too great for other reasons.  Foster carers may give notice at any time. In some cases, this may enable a planned transition during the notice period.  But in others, this may lead to the immediate termination of the placement and urgent alternative arrangements having to be put in place without any prior planning.  The latter, if it occurs, can be particularly unsettling and would be likely to cause emotional harm. Social workers will change and move on.  Ms Buckley described her experience of meeting with a child who had been in foster care from a young age.  The first thing that child said to her was that she was the 26</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> social worker the child had met and had to recount a life story to.  That brought home to Ms Buckley (as it does to this Court) how different that child&#8217;s experiences were to a child placed in an adoptive home. To add to all this, there is the stigma and level of intrusion that goes with being a looked after child.  How they go about their daily life is affected by rules and limits on occasions such as holidays or sleepovers.  This type of thing can become important for children as they get older.</span></p>

Their concern is that this would not provide him with legal and emotional security and the sense of belonging that an adoptive family provides.

It is likely that adoption at this early stage in his life will give BK the opportunity to form a secure attachment to an adoptive family. I accept that, sadly, it may be the case that such a placement is not identified for BK.  But this does not mean that the Court should refuse to make a Placement Order.

But permanence planning for BK should not be put on hold to allow for that to happen.  Indeed, Ms Buckley was clear in her evidence that FC herself wishes for BK to have the stability and security that adoption would provide.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian&#8217;s evidence was that FC was not asking the Court to delay making a final decision for BK and she would cooperate in arrangements sanctioned by the Court including supporting his transition to an adoptive placement if one is identified. There is an obvious welfare benefit to BK if assessment of FC helps to inform any contingency plan, should the LA be faced with having to change course in the future through lack of an identified adoptive placement.  But the suggestion that I should delay making a decision for BK (as the parents invite me to) is a step too far and fails to put BK&#8217;s welfare as paramount.  In saying this, I have regard to the delay principle enshrined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>. The Court must have regard to the general principle that any delay in making a decision is likely to prejudice BK&#8217;s welfare.  The particular facts of this case reinforce this.  These proceedings were issued after BK was admitted to hospital with very serious injuries at the age of 12 weeks.  He is now nearly 2 years old. To further delay my decision would be prejudicial to BK. The professionals are right when they say he should not wait any further for a decision about his long-term welfare.  </span></p>

Equally, it is unsurprising that the parents say otherwise. They are strongly opposed to BK being placed for adoption.

Her written submissions cite a wealth of material including research evidence, the report of the Public Law Working Group and a series of speeches by Sir Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Division, emphasising the importance of promoting an ongoing relationship through contact between siblings, in circumstances where Court approved Care Plans mean that their lives have taken a different course.  The core message that comes from this material is that there needs to be an enhanced awareness of this amongst professionals and the Courts, and their approach to contact must be creative and focused on making such contact happen when it is in the best interests of the chid to do so.  As part of that approach, the Courts have a key role not only in scrutinising with care the details of the plan for contact, but also how that practically it is to be achieved.  It is here that the issue about whether an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/26" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 26</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> should be made comes to the fore. </span></p>

The Court&#8217;s focus is solely on the best interests of the child, not on those of potential future adopters. Where, for the reasons that I have attempted to set out in this lecture, the Court considers that there should be continuing contact up to and after adoption it should establish this by a Court order at the time of making a placement order.

It is not good enough to allow the child&#8217;s contact plans to be driven primarily by the wishes of adoptive parents, or indeed the perceived wishes of as yet unidentified adoptive parents (as happens when contact plans are scaled back lest they &#8216;put off&#8217; prospective adopters). It is however vital that once adopters are identified they can have input into the exact shape of contact plans and in determining what support is needed. There is a need to consider how Courts can underline the child&#8217;s need to maintain relationships at the placement order stage, in some cases through the making of a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/26" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 26</ref> order which will last until the adoption order is made.

I consider it my responsibility, having regard to that evidence, to analyse whether a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/26" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 26</ref> contact order might hinder the task of family finding for BK.  If making a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/26" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 26</ref> contact order creates that risk, that will have an adverse impact on BK&#8217;s welfare.  Factoring that in is not the Court improperly shifting its focus to the interests of potential adopters.  Rather, it is the Court keeping its focus on </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">BK&#8217;s</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> best interests and putting the risk of deterring potential adopters into the holistic welfare balance for him.  This is what the professionals have done in this case. It is what I also do. To say that &#8220;Courts should not be inhibited by a fear of not finding adoptive parents&#8221; is, I respectfully suggest, wrong in principle.  If that risk exists, then I would be failing in my duty to BK if I did not put it in the welfare balance.  If further support for this proposition is needed, it comes from paragraphs 17 and 56 of the recent Court of Appeal ruling in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re D-S</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> (quoted at paragraph 74 above). The Court of Appeal clearly treated this as a material factor directly relevant to its welfare decision not to make any contact order in that case. </span></p>

The issue whether an order should be made is self-evidently one for the Court, and I have scrutinised with care what they say and why.  One question I have asked myself is whether this Court is faced with a professional consensus because they have ingrained beliefs that are out-of-date and fail to appreciate and take forth the message which runs as a thread though the material relied upon by Ms Anning on behalf of the Mother. However, having seen the professional witnesses give evidence and the balanced way in which they responded to skilled cross-examination, I am clear that this is not the case, indeed far from it.  They all spoke of the benefits of the sibling relationship being maintained through ongoing direct contact.  At the same time, they spoke with conviction about BK, currently aged 1 year 11 months, and what they say is his paramount welfare need now, throughout his childhood and into adulthood. Their collective view is that BK should experience family life and achieve permanence and stability through being placed for adoption. Their view that a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/26" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 26</ref> contact order could hinder rather than help achieve that outcome for BK was rooted in securing his best interests.</span></p>

They are understandably curious about the background facts which led the Court to sanction the plan of adoption.  They know that the reasons must have been very serious. Even if they are open to discussing and seeking to work out contact, what they learn about the history is likely to cause them to think very carefully about what impact direct contact will have on their family unit when the adopted child is placed in their care.  It is no surprise that this weighs on their mind.  Indeed, it would be surprising if it did not.</span></p>

Potential adopters would need to be told information which is likely to weigh heavily in their thinking. There would be a balance of factors pulling in different directions. On the one hand, they would learn that HK is in foster care and he and BK have enjoyed an ongoing relationship through contact. They would be told the views of professionals (shared by the parents) that both children will benefit if that sibling relationship can be maintained through direct contact. They would also be told that HK is continuing to see his parents and that the parents have not done anything to undermine his foster placement.   On the other hand, potential adopters would need to know the reasons why the Court has sanctioned the plan of adoption for BK, and for HK to remain in long-term foster care. They would learn of the very serious injuries inflicted on BK by his father, the emotional harm suffered by HK, the appalling content of the messages, and the failure to protect and seek medical attention for BK.  Added to this would be the parents&#8217; dishonesty throughout this Court process, actively seeking to deceive professionals and the Court, causing a justified lack of any confidence that they would be open and honest when making plans to secure the children&#8217;s safety and wellbeing. Potential adopters would be told that the parents opposed the plan to place BK for adoption.</span></p>

This is not simply potential adopters having &#8220;fear of the unknown&#8221; (as Ms Anning characterises it).

The first period would be whilst BK remains in foster care and a search for an adoptive match is undertaken.  It is not in issue that direct sibling contact should continue to be arranged in that period, and therefore no <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/26" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 26</ref> order is needed to ensure this.  The second period would be after any move to live with prospective adopters through to when any adoption order is made. Although Ms Anning has suggested that this might only be a short length of time, this is not necessarily so.  It would depend upon when any adoption application is made and when it were determined.  The question whether a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/26" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 26</ref> contact order should be made to cover that period is more complex because it would require the prospective adopters to comply with an order which they had no say about when it was made.  I can see how this may worry them.  A Court order is just that; it must be complied with.   That, in turn, creates the risk that they will decide that being matched as prospective adopters for BK is not something they are prepared to take forwards.  A <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/26" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 26</ref> order which leads to that outcome would be against BK&#8217;s best interests rather than promoting his interests. That is why the professionals urge the Court to the view that the better approach is to leave it to the social workers on the ground to discuss and seek to work out arrangements for sibling contact that the prospective adopters are agreeable to.  I consider there is an advantage, not a disadvantage, to BK (and indeed HK) of approaching contact in that way.</span></p>

In reaching this conclusion, I am not questioning the importance of seeking to maintain a relationship through contact between BK and HK.
