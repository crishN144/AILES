The first is to what extent, if at all, the oral evidence and/or submissions will actually disclose matters which could adversely prejudice H and related third parties in the overseas company proceedings or otherwise. This can only be answered having heard the evidence itself. Second, and noting that the RRO application was to be served on Brian Farmer of the Press Association, to what extent, if at all, do the press oppose the RRO in the name of open justice and the Article 10 rights of the public at large. This can only be answered once any journalists attending the hearing have had the opportunity to hear the evidence and submissions, and consider whether they wish to address me on this application.</p>

I do so to hold the ring and to preserve the tenability of H&#8217;s arguments so that, the unknowns having become known, I can decide what weight is to be attributed to the Article 8 ECHR arguments and can conduct the full balancing exercise required by <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span>.

The balance, at least on an interim basis, therefore favours the making of the order. I would point out that were I to make the substantive decision now, and run the risk of foreclosing future possibilities, the media may be left with less to report at end of the day. I stress that the order I now make is a short-term and strictly time-limited restraint. </p>
