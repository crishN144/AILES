	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matter was listed before me for the purposes of considering the Part 25 application, and case management. Very shortly (a few minutes) before the hearing commenced, I received an email from the Mother&#8217;s solicitor, Mr Leach, stating that he was seeking to withdraw the Part 25 application for a psychological assessment. Given the lateness of this application I decided not to allow the application to be withdrawn, but rather consider the matter and give a reasoned decision. It is not acceptable for court time and public funds to be wasted by decisions to withdraw applications being made so late. I also note that every skeleton argument/position statement was submitted long after the Case Management Order dated 23 January 2024 had ordered. The late production of skeletons arguments/position statements places an undue burden on judges and causes quite unnecessary delays. These comments do not relate to the Father&#8217;s team, who was not a party at the relevant time. </p>

The LA applied for an Interim Care Order (&#8220;ICO&#8221;) before he was due to leave hospital.  The interim Threshold alleges that Mother failed to engage with antenatal services, including mental health services, and that there was a risk of harm from her association with the Father, who had a history of offences. </p>

The LA&#8217;s initial plan was for interim separation, however on the day of the urgent removal hearing the LA changed its plan to one of the Mother and child being placed in a mother and baby foster placement. There was a slight delay in finding a placement and there was a further hearing on 23 January 2024. At that hearing the placement was agreed and they have remained in that placement since that date. I am very pleased to say that the reports so far have been very positive of the Mother. </p>

An application under Part 25 for a psychological/cognitive assessment must be accompanied by proper evidence which explains why the case goes beyond the standard difficulties faced by many parents in care proceedings. The evidence must explain why the parent&#8217;s needs cannot be properly managed by careful use of language and the professionals taking the time to explain matters in an appropriate manner. The evidence must address why such an assessment is necessary rather than just something that would be &#8220;nice to have&#8221;. </p>

There may have been some discussion at that stage of the LA using the ParentAssess framework when assessing the Mother.

The Guardian first met the Mother on 1 February 2024. In the light of the application for a cognitive assessment the Guardian spent about an hour with the Mother and considered her cognitive functioning. The Guardian&#8217;s view is neatly summarised in paragraph 9 of her Skeleton Argument:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is in my view unfortunate that the Guardian and her solicitor stated they were &#8220;neutral&#8221;. It is quite clear from the Skeleton that the Guardian did not consider the test of necessity in Part 25 to have been met, but still remained neutral on the application. Guardians, and the Children&#8217;s solicitors, play an important role in care proceedings in ensuring that the interests of the child are met by minimising delay and maximising the efficient use of resources, in particular by assisting the Court to &#8220;Make Cases Smaller&#8221;, see the President of the Family Division&#8217;s The Road Ahead. If it is clear to the Guardian and the Child&#8217;s solicitor that an application should be refused, then they should make that clear to the Court. </p>

It is, after all, an ordinary English word. It is a familiar expression nowadays in family law, not least because of the central role it plays, for example, in Article 8 of the European Convention and the wider Strasbourg jurisprudence. If elaboration is required, what precisely does it mean? That was a question considered, albeit in a rather different context, in Re P (Placement Orders: Parental Consent) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2008/535" uk:canonical="[2008] EWCA Civ 535" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWCA Civ 535</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 2 FLR 625" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 2 FLR 625</ref> , paras [120], [125]. This court said it &#8220;has a meaning lying somewhere between &#8216;indispensable&#8217; on the one hand and &#8216;useful&#8217;, &#8216;reasonable&#8217; or &#8216;desirable&#8217; on the other hand&#8221;, having &#8220;the connotation of the imperative, what is demanded rather than what is merely optional or reasonable or desirable.&#8221; In my judgment, that is the meaning, the connotation, the word &#8216;necessary&#8217; has in rule 25.1 .&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In deciding whether to allow an application for a psychologist to carry out a cognitive assessment, it is also critical to bear in mind the existence of the Advocates Gateway and the requirement for all those working with parents in care proceedings to be sensitive to their needs. I referred to the Advocates Gateway and the need for all those working in this part of the justice system to be familiar with it and apply its principles in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">West Northamptonshire Council v KA (Intermediaries)</span> [2024] EWHC 79 at [46]. It would only be appropriate to order a psychological assessment relevant to the Court process if the approach in the Advocates Gateway was plainly insufficient. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It will often be the case that parents may struggle to absorb information, to understand the proceedings and to concentrate through meetings and hearings. However, the solution to this problem is not, in the majority of cases, to have cognitive assessments and appoint intermediaries. It is for all the professionals involved, including lawyers and judges, to bear closely in mind the need to use simple language, avoid jargon, and where appropriate check that a litigant has understood what is being said. That is all set out in the Advocates Gateway. </p>

The fact that Mr Leach referred to taking a &#8220;belt and braces&#8221; approach indicates strongly that the proper test was not being considered either by counsel when she advised or by the solicitors when they made the application. Unfortunately, such misconceived applications are exceedingly common, particularly in respect of applications for psychologists to undertake cognitive assessments. </p>

But that is not the purpose of the Part 25 application. Further, and in any event, that type of analysis is one that all social workers should necessarily be very familiar with. There was again nothing in this case which justified going beyond normal good social work practice. </p>
