	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The assets in these financial remedies proceedings are, as I find, about &#163;50 million, almost all in the name of the husband (&#8220;H&#8221;). The wife (&#8220;W&#8221;) has very modest resources of about &#163;291,000. The period of cohabitation and marriage lasted about 5 &#189; years. There are two children, for whom W is and will remain the primary carer. The principal issue before me is the interplay between (i) the terms of a pre-marital agreement (&#8220;PMA&#8221;) which purports to limit severely W&#8217;s financial remedies claims in her own rights and (ii) the financial needs of W and the children.</p>

The sale of her flat also generated a stamp duty rebate for H on the purchase of the FMH in the sum of about &#163;84,000.

I thought she did her best to tell the truth. In reality, there was never any real issue on the relevant facts, although W at times fell into speculation or guesswork in relation to some financial matters, for example the cost of holidays taken during the marriage. It was apparent to me that W feels hurt and let down by H who she believes is not willing to support her and the children properly, and (as she sees it) uses the PMA to seek to avoid his responsibilities. In my view, she feels vulnerable and dependent. She has next to no assets of her own, no job, and is tasked with bringing up the children. She has given up her flat in capital city A and committed herself to a marriage which did not endure. All of this has created a considerable degree of anxiety, mixed with anger and frustration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties are in dispute about the standard of living they enjoyed. I would describe it as a comfortable, but not extravagant, lifestyle, commensurate with their wealth. They lived in a &#163;5m house in London. The children are in private education. They ate out regularly although I think W exaggerated the frequency of trips to the finest London restaurants. They had access until 2019 to H&#8217;s rented flat in capital city B, and a country house in country B co-owned by H and his business partner. They had regular holidays including to destinations such as Mauritius, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka and Marrakesh (sometimes travelling business class). W has produced a schedule which estimated the total cost of holidays from 2017 to 2022 (which includes the Covid pandemic era) at an average of about &#163;50,000pa. She acknowledged in cross examination that many of the figures were estimated. Although H has had that schedule since January 2024, he did not substantially challenge it in his written evidence. On the first attended day of the trial his counsel attempted to produce a detailed schedule of H&#8217;s comments on the figures which purport to demonstrate that the overall holiday expenditure was far less than W claimed. I refused to allow that schedule, into the evidence. In any event, as I understood it, no underlying evidence to support H&#8217;s comments (e.g. hotel bills or credit card statements) was produced. It therefore seemed to me that H&#8217;s oral evidence on these matters was inevitably deficient to some degree. I am left with uncertainty about the actual cost of the holidays, although a cross reference to actual, disclosed bank statements showed that W&#8217;s estimates for 2021 and 2022 of about &#163;30,000pa (lower than previous years because of Covid and the birth of the children) were reasonably accurate. What is not in doubt that the holidays did indeed to take place, and, certainly in the pre Covid years, on 7 or 8 occasions each year. My sense overall is that the cost of the holidays was not as much as suggested by W, but these sorts of holidays will nevertheless have come at reasonably significant cost. </p>

I doubt she really thought through the potential consequences in the event of marriage breakdown, particularly if children were born. This is, in my experience, true of one or both parties to many PMAs who sign up in the anticipation that it will never need to be referred to.

She estimates that, due to her parenting commitments, she will not be able to exercise a meaningful earning capacity for at least 5 years, at which point she hopes to earn up to &#163;21,000pa gross on a self-employed basis. Although W has a degree, and a Masters, it is, in my judgment, unrealistic to expect her to return to a corporate career, to which she was not suited, which she did not enjoy, and which she would have to dovetail with the children&#8217;s needs. Moreover, given her mental health problems there is a question mark about whether she would be sufficiently robust to venture back into that high pressured world. With H&#8217;s encouragement, she did apply for full time finance jobs in 2021, during Covid when she would have been working from home and they had only one child, although I had the sense that her heart was not really in it. Such full-time jobs would no longer be appropriate as the parties are separated, there are now two children and working fully from home is not achievable. In any event, she did not secure any employment and the feedback she received that she had been out of the sector for too long is unsurprising. In my judgment W&#8217;s own assessment of her earning capacity is a reasonable one to adopt.</p>

Nevertheless, it seems to me to be instructive to consider what a sharing claim might otherwise have produced for her, as being illustrative of what rights she has conceded. My focus here is principally on H&#8217;s business interests which on any view increased in value during the marriage; any such increase was not by reference to passive growth but active management by two hard working individuals. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the time of marriage, H put his business interest at &#8364;45.3m gross. On a like for like basis (i.e ignoring discounts and tax) it is now about &#8364;75m gross. Thus, the increase during the marriage (or at any rate to the Form E, which was less than a year after the separation)  was about &#8364;30m. Applying the discount of 20% for illiquidity brings that figure down to about &#8364;24m. Deducting tax at 27%  reduces the figure further  to &#8364;17.5m, i.e about &#163;15m. I appreciate that all of this is hedged with uncertainty, but it at least gives some indication of the net increase during the marriage. It follows that the effect of the PMA may be to deprive W of a claim to 50% of the gain i.e about &#163;7.5m. It may also be that she would have been able to establish a sharing claim in other assets, notably the FMH. I accept that I did not have full argument on this, but it was clearly flagged up in W&#8217;s counsel&#8217;s opening Note (specifically para 44) and I see no reason why I cannot, or should not, consider this aspect in broad, but tentative terms.  It does not seem to me unreasonable to assume that, had it not been for the PMA, there would have been at least an arguable sharing claim given that, on H&#8217;s own figures, from marriage to his Form E the business value went up by about &#8364;30m gross. </p>

By that document, signed with full knowledge of its meaning and consequences, and with the benefit of legal advice, W was aware that her claims on divorce would be heavily restricted. Future anticipated circumstances included the birth of children and provision was calibrated in the alternative (children or no children). The marriage was relatively short (just over 5 &#189; years including a period of cohabitation). H was independently wealthy at the time of signing the PMA, and clearly (as W acknowledged) wanted to protect that wealth, particularly his business. All of these points weigh in the balance. </p>

Further, the fact of marrying and having children has had a significant impact upon her. She is no longer an independent woman in capital city A with a mortgage free flat and stable earnings. She is (and certainly feels) vulnerable and dependent. She now has no alternative property of her own, and her earning capacity has been heavily diminished. She committed some of the proceeds of her flat to fund renovations to the FMH which belongs to H and in which she has no legal interest, and took an active part in the refurbishment project; those actions have financially benefited H, as the legal owner, but not her. H also benefited from the stamp duty rebate. I was struck by H in evidence referring to W&#8217;s financial contribution to the renovations as a gift to him which seemed to me to be a technical adherence to the PMA with minimal recognition of what W gave up.  She contributed fully to the marriage as wife and mother, and made sacrifices for the sake of the relationship (the sale of the flat and giving up full time work.</p>

Her capital, on H&#8217;s case, would comprise the lump sum of &#163;818,025 plus her own modest assets, but those sums would be needed to meet her income needs.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear that W is deeply attached to the FMH. I suspect it is something of an anchor at a very challenging time for her when the marriage has broken down, bitter litigation has ensued, she is the principal carer of the children, she faces an uncertain financial future, she has minimal assets and no meaningful earnings, and there are ongoing physical and mental health issues. However, it does seem to me that, in the context of this case (including the terms of the PMA), the FMH overhouses her and the children, who are young enough to be able to adapt easily to a move. It ties up a very large proportion of the non-business assets; absent sale, it would be difficult for H to pay a capitalised sum which W seeks, and meet the obligations of child maintenance and school fees, from his remaining non-business capital. He might well have to resort to accessing capital from the business which is contrary to the terms of the PMA and unfair to him. There is ample housing stock available within reach of the schools, and in amenable local areas, albeit not necessarily to the same standard as the FMH. I am confident that W also, once these proceedings have settled down, will adjust to different accommodation. In my judgment, the FMH should be sold, and W should receive a sum of money outright for purchase of an alternative property.</p>

W and the children will need to accept a compromise between size of property and location, but H&#8217;s particulars are far too much of a compromise.

The consequence would be for her to sell her property at that stage and find alternative, cheaper accommodation. On the facts of this case I have decided against that course for the following reasons: (i) I do not think that W will be able to purchase a vast or extravagant property for &#163;2.75m, (ii) the difference between &#163;2.75m and a reasonable sum for W alone is, in my judgment, likely to be relatively modest in the context of the assets in this case, (iii) it may be that the entirety of the sum would be needed if, for example, she wanted to move to a smaller property but in a more desirable location, (iv) I do not see why she should be forced to sell when she would no doubt hope that the children, by then adult, and in due course grandchildren, would come to stay, (v) she should have the option of releasing funds for her own income needs if required, particularly as the capitalised periodical payments may not be sufficient and (vi) it is unreasonable for her to look constantly over her shoulder, with the attendant anxiety of a forced sale at some point in the future. </p>

Those sums were, as I have indicated, about &#163;250,000pa on average in 2021 and 2022. I take into account that the purchase by W of a smaller property than the FMH is likely to reduce some costs, and, further, that W&#8217;s budget going forward is for three people, not four. Further, H points out, I think reasonably, that these figures included a total of about &#163;72,000 for art purchases and &#163;18,000 for H&#8217;s hobby of antique books which might fall in the category of non-recurring items; deducting these items brings the annual expenditure to closer to about &#163;205,000pa. I am less persuaded that smaller sums for H&#8217;s therapy and some post separation accommodation costs in the latter part of 2022 should also be disregarded; the monies might just as easily have been spent on something else. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The 10-year term is arguably generous to H. W might legitimately have sought periodical payments until the children reach 18 or finish tertiary education. I am not entirely confident that she will be self-sufficient within 10 years. Partly for that reason I have, as indicated above, not provided for any step down in W&#8217;s accommodation.</p>

In my judgment, a 5-year time span before she can earn sums at that level is more appropriate, to be factored into a Duxbury  calculation. If she earns anything before the initial 5-year period comes to an end, it is likely to be modest and should be ignored.</p>

H will have ample liquid funds to pay the lump sum and the capitalised pps order from his share of the sale proceeds of the FMH, with monies to spare. He will retain all of his bank balances and investments, including the private equity funds which are due to pay out over 2025 to 2030. His business will be unaffected. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am quite satisfied that no order for costs is the proper outcome here. True, W&#8217;s first two offers, in October 2023 and January 2024, sought about &#163;12m and &#163;11m respectively to be paid to W outright, plus child maintenance and school fees. Those offers were hopelessly ambitious and completely ignored the PMA. But her final offer in February 2024 was arithmetically much closer to my decision in this judgment, although she has not succeeded in retaining the FMH. H by contrast did not make an open offer at all until 26 February 2024 (6 weeks before trial), and has maintained throughout that W should receive nothing beyond the terms of the PMA. In fact, I have departed from the PMA so as to meet W&#8217;s needs, and H&#8217;s offer has fallen well short. Further, the most glaring piece of litigation misconduct was H&#8217;s inexcusable failure to disclose the purchase of his property until after the event. Either party is at liberty now, in the light of this judgment, to apply to me for a costs order to be made, but I will require very strong persuasion to do so. </p>
