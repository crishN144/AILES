Since 28 September 2021, S has been a ward of court. He is a Portuguese national of Pakistani origin. The proceedings arose out of: (i) the removal of S by F from Portugal, and out of the care of M, to be placed with U and A in Manchester on 22 November 2020 when he was 2 months old; and (ii) M&#8217;s departure from Portugal to Pakistan the very next day, accompanied by F&#8217;s brother and wife.</span></p>

He told me that he had not been back to Portugal since 12 April 2022, but under cross examination said he had been back once for medical treatment. He could not easily explain why his most recent statement says that &#8220;it will be important for [S] to return to his/her country of origin [Portugal]&#8221;. I was surprised to hear he had been in this country all this time without informing the court, and it seems neither he, nor U and A, informed the Guardian of this significant change of circumstances.</span></p>

Then he said that they (i.e U and A) want S to live with them as his primary carers, and to adopt him, which in my judgment was the truth of what U and A want to achieve. He said that S is very attached to them, that he sees himself as S&#8217;s father and A as S&#8217;s mother. He added that he does not think S benefits from having contact with M, and went so far as to say that he would prefer it if M returned to Pakistan.

M has demonstrated commitment to S, including undertaking the lengthy round trips for contact. M&#8217;s confidence in her own parenting is improving and there are no safeguarding reasons not to place S in her care. There is no reason, in her view, why S should not live with M. She considers that S has suffered emotional harm through being removed from M. S believes that U and A are his parents, and his cousin is his brother. This &#8220;myth&#8221;, as the Guardian aptly describes it, cannot, in her view, continue, and I agree. She is concerned that there is a lack of recognition among F, U and A as to M&#8217;s role in S&#8217;s life, and she is troubled that they do not accept the findings made in January. She was clear that S should move to M&#8217;s care, more or less straight away. </span></p>

Otherwise, a situation like this might arise where no action is being taken at all, yet the contracting state, despite its own inaction, retains jurisdiction indefinitely. I do not consider that can be right. Understandably, given the proceedings taking place here and the unanimous agreement of the parties that England is the appropriate jurisdiction to consider welfare matters, the Portuguese court is taking no steps at all. It is de facto deferring to the English courts. That is unsurprising given that S has been living in England since November 2020, U and A live here, M is now here, and F has also recently relocated to England. </span></p>

He is fed, clothed, and cared for. They show love and devotion. There are no concerns about the physical care provided by them. He has been in their care for a year and a half and there is a bond between them. The far greater risk is the emotional and psychological harm caused to a child who grows up in the care of extended family rather than being brought up by a parent, and who believes that U and A are his parents, and his cousin is his brother. This falsehood, or more accurately web of falsehoods, denying S the truth about his birth family and identity, cannot and must not continue.  He needs an honest narrative as soon as possible. The alternative, to deny him the truth about who he is, would be almost unimaginably harmful for him. The fact that F, U and A regard this as acceptable demonstrates an almost staggering lack of empathy and insight.  The emotional risks for S are self-evident. In my judgment, F, U and A see this in terms of their own needs, not the needs of S. They are perpetuating abusive and controlling behaviour to M, marginalising her and denying S his fundamental right to grow up with his mother. I find it difficult to trust them to ensure that S has any knowledge or understanding of M&#8217;s role in his life, let alone a balanced view of M, if he were to remain living with U and A.</span></p>

F does not put himself forward as a primary carer, preferring to outsource to U and A. M needs some support, which fortunately she receives from her family. She needs housing and financial assistance; she currently lives with her cousin and will be able to live with her brother, both of whom provide financial support, and she has some earnings from her part time job. Her application under the EU Settlement scheme which would give her security of immigration status has been accepted and she awaits the final decision; her immigration lawyers are confident of her prospects and in the meantime, she is permitted to live in the United Kingdom, work, and access benefits. She will take time to adjust to caring for S, having been deprived of his company for so long. But I am confident that she will be able to provide consistent, loving, and stable care for S. The Guardian&#8217;s view is that S will thrive in M&#8217;s care, and I agree. She also considers that S will be able to adjust in moving from U and A to M, and again I agree. I propose to make an order that S lives with her.

He has a bond with U and A and has been happy in their care for a year and a half. However, the findings are damning. In my judgment, contact with F, U and A should start on a professionally supervised or supported basis. I cannot ignore (i) F&#8217;s actions in causing S to be removed from M against her will, and M to be stranded, (ii) the findings of domestic abuse and (iii) the fact that under my order S will henceforth be living with M, against the will of F, U and A.  Given the history of this case, abduction of S by F and/or his family remains, in my view, a tangible risk. I am concerned also about the narrative which F, U and A might seek to impart to S. There needs to be a period of time with proper scrutiny to be satisfied that S is not at risk during periods of contact with F, U and A. </span></p>
