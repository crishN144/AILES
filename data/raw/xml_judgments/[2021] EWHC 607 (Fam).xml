I have been the allocated judge throughout these proceedings and am very familiar with the case.  I have not heard oral evidence, but I have read voluminous documentation and heard submissions from the parties.  I am quite satisfied that I have sufficient overview of the facts to reach the conclusions set out in this judgment.  </span></p>

By application dated 28 September 2020 her father (&#8220;F&#8221;) seeks an order that her mother (&#8220;M&#8221;) returns her to this jurisdiction from the USA, asserting that she was wrongfully removed there on 29 August 2020. Although the USA is a signatory to the Hague Convention 1980, Article 4 disapplies the application of the Convention to any child over the age of 16 at the time of removal.  DD had just turned 16 as at 29 August 2020, and accordingly F was unable to seek a return order under the Convention.  </span></p>

The remedy is the same. A Children Act application would have enabled the case to be allocated to the appropriate level.  Instead, the commonplace practice of applying via the wardship jurisdiction means that a case of this nature must be heard by a High Court Judge, or s9 authorised judge.

The Guardian describes her in this way: &#8220;Despite the toxicity of the adults&#8217; relationships, it is clear that DD has received good parenting as she has grown into a charming and intelligent young woman, and of this all the adults who have had responsibility for her care should be proud&#8221;.

F is 56 and M 43. F has since remarried on 28 April 2018, and M also has a new partner. Protracted Children Act proceedings took place. In August 2013 primary care for DD was transferred from M to F on an interim basis. On 14 April 2014 DJ Robinson (as he then was) made a final order confirming residence in favour of F, and providing for contact between M and DD. Overnight contact was specified to take place on limited occasions and subject to supervision. The reasons for the restrictions on contact (particularly overnight contact) appear to have been rooted in concerns surrounding M&#8217;s poor parenting which was at the time allegedly characterised by alcohol and drug misuse, prostitution, and neglect of DD. I do not need to investigate, let alone make findings on, these matters. The transfer of residence and requirement of supervised overnight contact speak for themselves.  </span></p>

Thereafter the parties engaged in discussions with a view to finalising an order; it is a shame that it has taken them over two months to be able to present a largely agreed order to me. I acknowledge in particular that an agreement under which DD continues to live in the United States is painful and difficult to bear for F who has been her primary carer for so many years, yet was kept entirely in the dark about DD&#8217;s departure to the United States. Happily, it is agreed that DD should travel to see F from time to time which is manifestly in her best interests. </span></p>

It was the stability of the residence that was important, not whether it was of a permanent character. There was no requirement that the child should have been resident in the country in question for a particular period of time, let alone that there should be an intention on the part of one or both parents to reside there permanently or indefinitely (In re R).  </span></p>

This requires an analysis of the child&#8217;s situation in and connections with the state or states in which he or she is said to be habitually resident for the purpose of determining in which state he or she has the requisite degree of integration to mean that their residence there is habitual. </span></p>

This is not to say continuing or historical connections are not relevant but they are part of, not the primary focus of, the court&#8217;s analysis when deciding the critical question which is where is the child habitually resident&#8217;. </span></p>

Her habitual residence at that point remained with this jurisdiction. She was subject to a child arrangements order committing her to the care of F, and had been living with him in this country as her primary carer for many years.  Her legal status, place of residence, school, family life, friends and all her major links were with the UK before her departure to the USA. She had far weaker links with the USA, was not familiar with it and was not permitted to move there absent an English court order.  In my judgment, the more deep-rooted the integration in one jurisdiction, the harder it will be to acquire the necessary degree of integration in another jurisdiction. She, and M, both knew that F opposed a move to the United States and expected such a move only to take place if sanctioned by the English court.  The move itself was conducted by subterfuge.  In my judgment, DD, upon her move, cannot have assumed definitively that it would be permanent, given her lack of familiarity with the USA and her knowledge of F&#8217;s resistance.  As matters have transpired, she has become settled and happy, but I conclude that the necessary degree of integration had not occurred by 28 September 2020, a matter of only 1 month after her departure. </span></p>

I have concluded that it is in his best interest's overall to return but that still begs the question of whether an order is appropriate or not given his age. I have thought more than twice about what the right outcome and order should be in respect of Q. I have considered whether given his age I should decline the application for the order for return but rather to operate on the belief that he will return with V in any event as I believe that he wishes to remain with her and a large part of him wishes to return to Poland anyway. If I leave the choice to him I feel reasonably sure that he will come under significant pressure from his mother and her partner to remain and I do not consider that to be in his best interest. I conclude that there may be some merit in Miss Papazian's point that although he describes his contact with his father as being undertaken in order to comply with the court order that may in fact be a mask for an underlying and genuine desire to have a relationship with his father. I have also obviously considered whether in making an order for return it will set up struggle between the court system seeking to enforce the return and Q resisting. From all I have read and heard about Q I do not conclude that this is a likely outcome. I conclude that it is more likely that Q will cooperate in the process of return. In respect of Q I'm also satisfied that an order for his return should be made pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding he is 17 and has expressed a desire to remain in the UK and not to return to Poland, I'm satisfied on a summary assessment of his welfare that a return is in his best interests notwithstanding his age and his expressed views. The summary welfare assessment comprises many elements and save in respect of his expressed views they point to his welfare being promoted by a return to Poland and the resumption of a full life there. I am fully alive to the unusual nature of making a return order in respect of a 17-year-old who says he does not wish to return. However I am particularly alive to the issue of the impact that the chronic parental conflict is having on the ability of Q and V to truly understand their own positions and to be able to express views which are not tainted by the backdrop to their lives that the conflict has given. I consider that making an order in respect of Q may in fact free him from responsibility which would otherwise be placed on him to seek to remain in England in support of the mother's ongoing campaign to remedy what occurred in Poland in 2014." </span></p>

Further, given that the 12-year-old was going anyway the decision of Q can easily be categorised as objectively unreasonable. I very much doubt that Williams J would have reached the same decision had he been concerned with the 17-year-old alone. </span></p>

Indeed, they should ordinarily be determinative of an application such as this, absent a powerful justification pointing the other way.  One can envisage a situation where the child&#8217;s wishes are not truly their own, suborned to the undue influence of one or other parent, or a third party. Or perhaps objectively the wishes of the child are so irrational that they demand being overridden by the court. Or perhaps it is clear that acceding to a child&#8217;s wishes will expose him/her to a situation of real danger.  But absent such an exceptional situation, it is hard to see how a court can do other than follow the wishes of a mature, clear thinking and rational child of this age. </span></p>
