	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The perpetrators of sexual abuse are inadequate individuals who control weaker people, often children, for their own gratification.  Their behaviour is always an abuse of power and usually a breach of trust.  They destroy families and blight childhoods.  They create dread in their victims by convincing them that the consequences of speaking out will be worse than the consequences of silence.  They create guilt in their victims by persuading them that they have somehow willingly participated in their own abuse.  They burden their victims with secrets.  They poison normal relationships, trade on feelings of affection, drive a wedge between their victims and others, and make family and friends take sides.  They count on the failure or inability of responsible adults, both relatives and professionals, to protect and support the victims.  Faced with exposure, they commonly turn on their victims, try to assassinate their characters, and get others to do the same.  Most often, their selfishness is so deep-rooted that they ignore other people&#8217;s feelings and are only capable of feeling pity for themselves. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The effects of sexual abuse on the victim can be lifelong, but because of the way perpetrators operate, most abuse goes undetected.  It takes courage to ask for help.  Victims are beset by feelings of shame, guilt and fear.  They should be able to have confidence that their accounts will be adequately investigated and that they will be appropriately supported.  Instead, experience shows that the abuse is often compounded by sceptical or inadequate reactions within the family and beyond.  It is not always possible to establish where the truth lies, but where it is possible to investigate, there must be a good reason not to do so.  The position of a complainant whose allegation is described as &#8216;unsubstantiated&#8217; is extraordinarily difficult, but sometimes &#8216;unsubstantiated&#8217; is no more than a euphemism for &#8216;uninvestigated&#8217;.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">In this case, a 15-year-old girl (who I will call G) told the police and social services that she had been subject to years of gross sexual and physical abuse by her stepfather, who I will call Mr C.  Having done this, she was promptly banished from the family home by her mother and forbidden from having any contact with her four younger siblings.  She then found a home with a kindly neighbour who looked after her for a year, largely at her own expense.  Although the investigating police officer and the girl&#8217;s social worker regarded her allegation as credible, she was treated as a child in need and no child protection procedures were invoked; instead, after five months&#8217; absence, it was Mr C who returned to the family home, while G herself remained outside the family.  It might well be asked: what was in it for this young person to confide in the authorities if these were to be the consequences?  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Two months after Mr C&#8217;s return, the second child in the family, a now 15-year-old boy who I will call B, told the police and social services that he too had been the victim of exactly the same kind of sexual and physical abuse (though during the earlier investigation he had denied it).  He now corroborated his sister&#8217;s account and added that Mr C had also made him engage in extreme sexual activity with her, something she then confirmed.  High among the distressing aspects of the matter, B described how the abuse continued after Mr C was allowed back into the home.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">It was only at this stage that steps were taken to protect B and the three younger children at home by placing them in foster care and starting care proceedings.  That was nearly a year ago.  In the meantime, a decision has been taken by the Crown Prosecution Service that the stepfather is not to be prosecuted for anything.  This long overdue fact-finding hearing in family proceedings is therefore the first opportunity for G and B to hear a decision on their allegations against Mr C and the first opportunity that Mr C has had to defend himself.</span></p>

By that stage, the mother (who had herself been an abuse victim in childhood) was at home alone and her new-found willingness to &#8216;believe&#8217; G had everything to do with her own emotional neediness and nothing to do with any real assessment of allegations that she had until then dismissed out of hand.  About two months after G returned to her mother's care, she became pregnant by a much older boyfriend who she had only just met.  </span></p>

Mrs S took G, who was very upset, to see two other neighbours and G repeated her account.  The three neighbours told G that she should not say these things if they were untrue.  G insisted that they were, so they then went with her to the family home and told the mother what she had said.  The mother was angry and said that G was an attention-seeker and a liar.  Mr C arrived and denied the allegations.  Mrs S took G to her house, from where G called the police.  She was taken to the police station and interviewed that night.  She then went to stay for two nights with one of the neighbours before moving to live with Mrs D, Mrs S's mother, where she remained for the next year.

The accounts fitted together securely, but not slickly in a way that would suggest collusion.  There were some inconsistencies about important details, for example their respective body positions when they were made to engage in sexual activity with each other.  On behalf of Mr C, Mr Rowley QC and Mrs Hughes rightly draw attention to this and other examples.  I am not troubled by the numerous variants within the evidence.  They are entirely consistent with what one would expect from children who have been chronically abused.  The accounts cover a very large number of highly-charged occasions over a very long period.  As B said at one point, things get blurred.  Young people cannot be expected to give a photographic replay of sequences of similar but varying events and get all the distasteful details right.  Assessment of such evidence cannot only focus on the level of precision with which children give descriptions, but calls for a much broader survey of all the relevant features.</span></p>

I find that B is unlikely to be correct about abuse having happened on that particular date.  Given the general level of activity in the home, this was an occasion when the opportunity for abuse was much reduced.  An analysis of the CCTV evidence shows that Mr C and B were only together at home for three uninterrupted periods of about half an hour each on that day, during which there were specific active preparations for the following day&#8217;s christening.  It is said on Mr C's behalf that the failure of this allegation, which might be described as the one most susceptible to proof or disproof, amounts to a fatal blow to B&#8217;s credibility.  I do not agree.  The manner and content of B&#8217;s allegation that the abuse continued after G left the home strongly persuades me that it is true, and that the continued abuse is what ultimately prompted him to speak out.  By far the most likely explanation for this aspect of the evidence is that B was mistaken about the date.</span></p>

Likewise, B made his allegations in full knowledge of what had happened to G, but nonetheless maintains them at great cost to himself.

In the same way, her decision to get G back home gave no thought to her daughter&#8217;s real needs but sprung entirely from her own isolation and unhappiness.</span></p>

By twice being confronted unexpectedly in the presence of the adults, G was effectively dropped in it.  Instead of protecting her, these actions made her situation at home even worse and made it even harder for her to speak about what was happening to her.</span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Against a background of chronic concerns and previous sexual abuse allegations, the social work assessment of the allegations that G made in July 2013 was superficial and inadequate.  As a result, the decision to treat these children as children in need, and subsequently to downgrade their status even further, was plainly wrong.  There was no risk assessment whatever.  There was no analysis of the issues, merely a recital of facts with no conclusions being drawn &#8211; see C270.  There was no thinking.  There was clear evidence in the form of G&#8217;s allegations and the family&#8217;s striking response that demanded the invocation of child protection procedures.  Instead, G&#8217;s emotional needs were forgotten while Mr C returned to the home and in the mother&#8217;s telling words</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt"> "everything settled down".</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> Had a Child Protection Case Conference been called, it would have been an opportunity for an experienced multidisciplinary assessment of this abnormal situation.  Proper consideration could have been given to the real needs of this sibling group.  G&#8217;s anomalous situation in living without contact with her family in an unregulated private fostering arrangement could have been improved.  B could have been protected.</span></p>

It is a serious imposition on children to record them speaking about such sensitive matters.  The least that they can expect is that their social worker will watch and listen to what they have had to say.  If crucial evidence of this kind is not absorbed, it is not surprising if misjudgments follow.</span></p>

This demanding case was the first to be allocated to her as a newly qualified social worker.  She was entitled to rely on her manager for supervision and guidance.  The local authority has had the opportunity to present evidence showing what that amounted to, but it has not done so.  Having heard Ms H give evidence, the first time that she has done so in any case, I was impressed by her grasp of the issues and her willingness to learn from experience.  She inherited a case that had already taken the wrong path and she is not personally or professionally responsible for the consequences.  </span></p>
