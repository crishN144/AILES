Because I anticipate this judgment will published in some form or another, I propose to be very short in describing the detail.  I also do not intend to put much of the detail of the evidence in the judgment because, reluctantly, I have come to the conclusion that the appeal must be allowed and it is for another judge now to take up the case without any spin put on the evidence by me in selecting one part of it or another.

In the event, three of those specific headings were not pursued at the fact-finding by counsel, Mr Brindle, who represented the mother, but the ones that were  pursued were, first of all, that the father had been emotionally abusive and, indeed, had  threatened to harm the mother and/or commit suicide himself at the time that the  relationship was coming to an end in an incident that took place on 20 December 2020. Secondly, the mother complained generally about the father&#8217;s sexual conduct during the course of the relationship where he would, she said:</span></p>

It is also the case that the mother had unhappily not enjoyed the best of mental health during her adolescence and early adulthood and was on medication at the time of the relationship, albeit that, for I think</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">a significant period, she stopped taking the prescribed medication.
