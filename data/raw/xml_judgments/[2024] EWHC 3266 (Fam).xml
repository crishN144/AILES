Both parents gave oral evidence confined to the defence of consent that had been raised by the Father.  At the conclusion of the evidence, both parties made oral submissions expanding on their skeleton arguments.  I am very grateful to both counsel for their assistance as well as to Ms Callaghan whose written and oral evidence I have found particularly helpful. The hearing itself took the full two days that had been allocated and at the end of the hearing I indicated to the parties that I would reserve judgment.</p>

The parties resumed their relationship however in December 2017. The parties agreed to relocate to the Czech Republic permanently and made the move in the summer of 2020.

The Mother claims that the Father was a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">controlling bully and took advantage of her</span>&#8221;.  Initially, the parties agreed that the children would remain with the Mother in the Czech Republic and the Father would continue his visits to see them.  What happened thereafter is the subject of sharp dispute, the detail of which I analyse below when determining the consent issue.   By way of summary, the Father states that the Mother repeatedly said that the children wanted to move to live with their Father in the UK.  The Father says that he continuously checked with the Mother that this was what the Mother wanted during April and May 2024.  The Father says that she reiterated that that is what she wanted.   The Mother says that she only referred to the children moving to the UK in heated arguments.</p>

I asked [B] what he meant by his mum &#8220;not being well in the head&#8221;. He replied, &#8216;sometimes she shouts at me and smacks me for no reason and when I was at the psychologist, she told me that my mum needs treatment&#8217;.<span style="font-style:italic"/>I asked [B] if the psychologist had actually said that to him. He replied, &#8216;yes, she said that my mum needs to have help before I do&#8217;. [B] did not tell me when it was that he had seen the psychologist.</p>

My mum doesn&#8217;t like my nanny because she is kind to us and plays with us. I think that my mum is jealous and that is why she is not nice to my nanny&#8217;. I explained to [B] that sometimes the Judge might be worried if they thought that a child was saying things that one of their parents had told them to say. [B] immediately said, &#8216;no-one has told me what to say&#8217;. I asked [B] if he thought that his mum was unwell because she shouts and smacks him, could he think of a time when his mum started to become unwell. [B] explained, &#8216;well, she has always done it since I was little and even when we lived in England, she has always smacked me and my sister sometimes&#8217;. I asked [B] how he would feel if his mother did get help and if she did not shout or smack him. He replied, &#8216;I would be happy then&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

In relation to the child objections defence, Ms Callaghan said that whilst [N] <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;stated that she would be happy to remain in England or to return to the Czech Republic, I do not consider her to have the maturity to understand the implications of her expressed preferences</span>.&#8221; </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;The court will wish to consider the strength of [B]&#8217;s expressed views, wishes and feelings to a return and examine whether this was a maturely reasoned and independently held view. [B] stated that he does not want to return to the Czech Republic and although he explained that this mostly related to him not wishing to live with his mother. [B] talked of probably &#8216;hating Czech&#8217; however this was with regard to his school experience, and he told me that even if his father wished to live there, he still would not want to attend school in the Czech Republic. [B] confirmed to me that the main reason for him not wanting to return was because he does not want to live with his mother. [B] presented as being angry toward his mother and he was unable to say anything positive about his relationship with her, whereas his view of his father was entirely positive.&#8221;</p>

The Father seemed to be telling [N] things rather than [N] explaining what had happened.  It seemed as though the Father was trying to get [N] to say things.</p>

She was asked whether that fact together with the recordings indicated alienating behaviour.  Ms Callaghan said that she could not comment on whether it was alienating behaviour but she felt that what was on the tapes seemed staged and she assumed staged for the purposes of this hearing. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Callaghan was asked about the fact that [B] had contacted her after her initial interview. She explained that she always gave the child an option of contacting her again after the meeting in case there was anything that they had forgotten.  [B] wanted to say that his paternal grandmother was living at home with him. He also wanted to clarify that he had heard for himself that the psychologist had said that his Mother was not well in the head.  [B] had told her that his Mother had hit him for reasons. Ms Callaghan asked him how he would feel if his Mother got help and he said he would be happy then.  Ms Callaghan thought that this showed that he could think differently about going back to the Czech Republic. She added that she was very sceptical that any psychologist would have discussions with a child about their mother having treatment. She suspected that [B] had overhead this comment.</p>

However she added that it was striking that [B] had said that he would be happy if his Mother had help and if she did not smack him.  The other aspect that was striking was that he had said his Mother had to work and did not have time and that she thought he was appreciating the attention he was now receiving from his Father. </p>

After the argument, the Respondent took the children out and sent her a message which referred to the Applicant saying all week for him to take the children to the UK, and that he was constantly saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">It doesn&#8217;t have to be this way</span>&#8221;, so he said he was going to buy flight tickets to do so. During the course of that afternoon, told the children that he was taking them to the UK with him, and by the time he returned, he had booked the flights. When the Respondent returned with the children, they were excited about going to the UK and stated that they wanted to go with their father. The Applicant confirms that she was at the end of her tether, and said to the children &#8220;well so you have no mother any more&#8221;, which they responded to and were clearly upset about. The Applicant was extremely distressed by what had happened and how quickly the Respondent had dealt with matters, to the extent that she became aware that this had been planned by him all along. She was very upset but did not know how to handle this and cause the children disappointment, however went and stayed in the garage overnight until the next day to ensure that the children did not see her reaction.&#8221;</p>

I have done nothing wrong but think about the kids, their best interests and did exactly what you wanted and what both the kids wanted. I went and bought the tickets because you told me to do so on more than one occasion.

I agreed that the children could go back to the UK for a trip, and made absolutely clear that they needed to return home to the Czech Republic during the summer.

The Article 13(b) defence required the court to be satisfied that there was a &#8220;grave risk&#8221;: something really serious that was more than the dislocation and inconvenience of relocation.  The court had to look at the situation that would meet the children on their return to the Czech Republic.  Aside from one unparticularised allegation of [N] banging her head there was only a vague allegation of emotional harm.  In any event the Mother had offered protective measures that ameliorate any Article 13(b) risk.  The protective measures were set out in the Mother&#8217;s statements:</p>

The audio recording of him speaking to N clearly showed the Father leading N.  He was unapologetic about having recorded [N].   If I accepted that [B] objected to return then it was open to the court to make a decision refusing summary return in [B]&#8217;s case but ordering [N]&#8217;s return.  Although that was not the Mother&#8217;s first choice it may be appropriate and proportionate.

There was no formalised planning in contrast in June 2024 in terms of the children going to the UK for a holiday.  There was an element of the removal that was clandestine and he pointed to the fact even now the Mother does not know where the children are living in the UK. As to what the Mother had said in her oral evidence, it was important to remember that the Mother was not giving evidence in her first language.  He accepted that the Mother had given different accounts and submitted that perhaps something had been lost in translation.

The relationship between the Mother and the children had been eroded and that would be restored with the children returning to the house where they had lived for the last 4 years. The Mother would promote the children&#8217;s relationship with the Father.  I should step back and look at everything in the round.   Finally, Mr Little accepted that if the court concluded that the Article 13(b) defence had been made out then the discretion was very unlikely to be exercised to order return. </p>

He argued that it was difficult now to see what the Mother&#8217;s actual case was on consent.  The conclusion must be that the Mother has been lying.  Her oral evidence was remarkably different from her statement.  Her oral evidence was inconsistent: at some points she said that she agreed for the children to go the UK for a trial period, at other times for a holiday and at other times agreed for permanent relocation. Mr Bain said that the evidence fairly analysed showed that by 9 June there was clear agreement for both children to go and live in the UK. </p>

As to that, there are compelling reasons why the removing parent must be aware of whether or not consent exists. The first is that as a matter of ordinary language the word &#8216;consent&#8217; denotes the giving of permission to another person to do something. For the permission to be meaningful, it must be made known. This natural reading is reinforced by the fact that consent appears in the Convention as a verb (&#8220;avait consenti/had consented&#8221;): what is required is an act or actions and not just an internal state of mind. But it is at the practical level that the need for communication is most obvious. Parties make important decisions based on the understanding that they have a consent to relocate on which they can safely rely. It would make a mockery of the Convention if the permission on which the removing parent had depended could be subsequently invalidated by an undisclosed change of heart on the part of the other parent, particularly as the result for the children would then be a mandatory return. Such an arbitrary consequence would be flatly contrary to the Convention&#8217;s purpose of protecting children from the harmful effects of wrongful removal, and it would also be manifestly unfair to the removing parent and the children.&#8221; </span></p>

As is clear from the earlier discussion, the Convention was the product of prolonged discussions in which some careful balances were struck and fine distinctions drawn. The underlying purpose is to protect the interests of children by securing the swift return of those who have been wrongfully removed or retained. The Convention itself has defined when a child must be returned and when she need not be. Thereafter the weight to be given to Convention considerations and to the interests of the child will vary enormously. The extent to which it will be appropriate to investigate those welfare considerations will also vary. But the further away one gets from the speedy return envisaged by the Convention, the less weighty those general Convention considerations must be.</p>

In consent or acquiescence cases, on the other hand, general considerations of comity and confidence, particular considerations relating to the speed of legal proceedings and approach to relocation in the home country, and individual considerations relating to the particular child might point to a speedy return so that her future can be decided in her home country.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">[46] In child's objections cases, the range of considerations may be even wider than those in the other exceptions. The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are "authentically her own" or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.&#8221;</p>

In reaching a decision, the court will consider the weight to be attached to all relevant factors, including: the desirability of a swift restorative return of abducted children; the benefits of decisions about children being made in their home country; comity between member states; deterrence of abduction generally; the reasons why the court has a discretion in the individual case; and considerations relating to the child&#8217;s welfare.</p>

Whilst her messages asking for updates on the travel to the airport and arrival at the hotel could be compatible with the Mother&#8217;s assertion in her witness statement that she had agreed only for the children to travel to the UK for a holiday, the fact that the Mother subsequently deleted some of her messages is not consistent with such an interpretation.  That is for two reasons.  First, that interpretation is inconsistent with the Mother&#8217;s oral evidence which variously indicated that rather than a visit for a holiday it was a &#8220;half and half&#8221; agreement (i.e. for [B] permanently to go to the UK and for [N] to return) or for them to go to the UK and to see how they each settled.  Secondly, there was no reason for the Mother to delete those messages if in fact the agreement had been for the children to go to the UK on holiday.  It is implausible that she deleted them because she changed her mind that they should go there on holiday.  What is far more likely is that she deleted them when she subsequently changed her mind about the children going to the UK to live with their Father.</p>

Such a visit would not necessitate a van coming to collect their things.  The Father&#8217;s reply where he refers to obtaining a quote for removals &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">to collect everything</span>&#8221; also supports the view that at this stage the Mother was referring to an agreed plan for the children to relocate to the UK.  Moreover, the Mother&#8217;s reference to her not being able to have the children for holidays is also inconsistent.  That reference in fact supports the Father&#8217;s evidence that the children were going to come back to the Czech Republic in the summer for a holiday &#8211; something which in this message the Mother seems to be rejecting.</p>

She talks about missing them indescribably (which is more consistent with a permanent relocation rather than them being away on holiday).   The messages indicate that the Mother subsequently changed her mind (see the message at 15:20, at paragraph 78 above).  Contrary to the Mother&#8217;s suggestion in her oral evidence that this was referring to the money for the properties the surrounding context strongly suggests that the Mother was in fact referring to changing her mind about the children relocating to the UK.</p>

Such inconsistency is not explicable by the fact the Mother was speaking in her second language.  The Mother speaks English fluently and in any event the difference between her written evidence and her oral evidence is so stark that it could not be reasonably explained by the fact that she was not speaking in her first language.  The instructions she gave to her solicitor and then the account that she gave in her detailed witness statement were completely at odds with her oral evidence.  In her written evidence she had made no reference to the agreement being a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">half and half</span>&#8221; agreement such that [B] would go to live in the UK and that they would see how [N] took to living there.   The Mother had also made no reference to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the door being left open</span>&#8221; for the children to return and that was why the places at the schools were kept open.   As the Mother herself accepted in her oral evidence there was no evidence in the bundle that the plan was only for [B] to stay in the UK (see above at paragraph 95).</p>

The Mother has implied that the Father was &#8220;building a case&#8221; and that she was being manipulated.  Clearly both parents were aware that their respective messages could be relevant (as demonstrated by the Mother deleting the Father&#8217;s messages on a number of occasions). Equally, the Father&#8217;s actions in recording [N] and securing footage from the external CCTV (apparently on the advice of his English lawyer) indicates on his own account that he was building a case.  The Mother herself though has sought to support her application to the court by extensive reliance on her messages (as indicated by the exhibits to her solicitor&#8217;s initial statement.)

He said that his Mother had broken three tablets and a Nintendo switch (para 18 of the report). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Recognising the tension between the summary nature of these proceedings and the court&#8217;s inability to resolve factual disputes between the parties and the risks that the children if will face if in fact they are true I take them at their highest.  Having done so, the question is whether they represent a &#8220;grave risk&#8221; that the children would be exposed to a physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the children in an intolerable situation.  Taking the allegations at their highest, in my judgment there would be such a grave risk.  If the Mother continued to be physically abusive to [B] and to [N] then it would undoubtedly lead to a situation that they should not be expected to tolerate.  In evaluating the risk, it is significant that Ms Callaghan considered that of a return order was made [B] would have a lot of resentment and might display angry defiant behaviour.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn then to consider the protective measures that have been proposed and whether they would be sufficient to ameliorate the grave risk.  I note that Ms Callaghan&#8217;s view that the Mother would require additional support for both herself and for [B] was accepted on behalf of the Mother by Mr Little.  Moreover, he accepted that that should be put in place in advance of any return (consistent with para 44 of the HCCH 2020 Good Practice Guide, cited above at paragraph 135).  Furthermore, the protective measures proposed by the Mother in her statement and amplified and expanded in submissions by Mr Bain can be incorporated into orders under article 11 of the 1996 Hague Convention which is a relevant factor &#8211; see the authorities cited above at paragraph 134).    Ms Callaghan did not consider that there were any protective measures required in addition to those offered by the Mother and the need for additional support for the Mother and for [B].  The Father did not seek to argue that additional protective measures were required.</p>

I cannot discount the possibility that at least some of the strength of [B]&#8217;s opposition to returning to the Czech Republic has been influenced by his Father.  But the Mother herself in her oral evidence stated that [B] had been unhappy in the Czech Republic and that both parents had considered whether he might be happier in the UK.  Furthermore, Ms Callaghan&#8217;s said that she believed [B]&#8217;s &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">view about not wanting to return to the Czech Republic to be his authentic view&#8221;</span>. </p>

He told Ms Callaghan that even if his Father wanted to live in the UK he did not want to go to school in the Czech Republic.   [B] is now aged 11 and, having considered Ms Callaghan&#8217;s report, I am satisfied that he has attained the age and maturity for the court to take into account his views.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Fourthly</span>, there are competing welfare considerations.  There are serious concerns as to the children&#8217;s treatment by their Mother in the Czech Republic (discussed above in relation to the Article 13(b) defence).    [B] has on all accounts been very unhappy in the Czech Republic.  Aspects of the evidence indicate that he is troubled (see for example the Mother&#8217;s reference to him keeping a secret diary, paragraph 66 above).  Ms Callaghan reports that the children have both settled well in the UK.  Nonetheless the Father&#8217;s conduct in leading N in the audio recordings (in such a way so as to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">instil fear</span>&#8221; in [N] as described by Ms Callaghan) and in blocking the Mother strongly indicate that the Father is opposed to the children maintaining a healthy relationship with their Mother.  Those welfare considerations cannot be fully assessed in summary proceedings such as these but clearly need to be addressed fully and promptly, whether in the existing English proceedings (currently stayed) or in the proceedings that I am told are also on foot in the Czech Republic. </p>
