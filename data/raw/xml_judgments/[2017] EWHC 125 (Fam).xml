The Judge has given permission for this anonymised version of the judgment (and any of the facts and matters contained in it) to be published on condition always that the names and the addresses of the parties and the children must not be published.  For the avoidance of doubt, the strict prohibition on publishing the names and addresses of the parties and the children will continue to apply where that information has been obtained by using the contents of this judgment to discover information already in the public domain. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that these conditions are strictly complied with.  Failure to do so will be a contempt of court.</p>

It is fair to say that over the course of the time the issue of immunisation has been before the court the mother has consented to other immunisations that the local authority wish SL to have.  However, the mother maintains her objection to SL being administered the Hib vaccine and the PCV vaccine.</p>

Dr de Keyser notes that the UK Immunisation Schedule provides that the Hib vaccine is given at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age, with a booster within a month of the first birthday.  He further notes that the PCV vaccine is given at 8 weeks and 16 weeks, with a booster within one month of the first birthday.  </p>

Dr de Keyser relates that many children who develop such infections become very ill and need in-patient treatment with antibiotics.  He cites the statistic that 1 in every 20 children with Hib meningitis will die and that those who survive may suffer long term problems, including hearing loss, seizures and learning disabilities.  Dr de Keyser further notes that the Hib bacteria can be transmitted to others through infected droplets in coughs and sneezes.</p>

He states that pneumococcal infections are caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, which infection can lead to pneumonia, septicaemia and meningitis.  At their most serious, Dr de Keyser states such infections may lead to permanent brain damage or death.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context, and in light of the mother&#8217;s objections to SL receiving the Hib vaccine and the PCV vaccine, I directed a jointly instructed expert report to assist the court in determining the application made by the local authority.  The court now has before it an expert report from Professor Kroll (Professor of Paediatrics and Honorary Consultant in Paediatric Infectious Diseases at Imperial College London and St Mary&#8217;s Hospital) dated 14 January 2017. That report opines that there is no medical reason why SL ought not to have the vaccinations in issue.  Professor Kroll appends to his report the Department of Health guidance entitled <span style="font-style:italic">Immunisation Against Infectious Diseases</span> (2006), updated in 2010. In particular, Professor Kroll states as follows in relation to the two vaccinations in dispute.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Haemophilus influenza Type b is a serious bacterial infection caused by Hib germs that usually strikes children under the age of 5 years of age. Prior to the introduction of the Hib vaccine into the UK Immunisation Schedule, Hib infection was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis.  Hib meningitis can be a rapidly progressive infection, hard to diagnose and treat in time to prevent permanent damage or, in some cases, death.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to the Hib vaccine, there are no living or dead bacteria in the Haemophilus Influenza Type b (Hib) vaccine.  The vaccine provokes a potent immune response that protects against such infection.  There are no absolute contra-indications to a child receiving Hib immunisation other than a personal history of hypersensitivity to the vaccine.  Such reactions are extremely rare.  Reaction to vaccination in another family member is not generally considered a contra-indication to vaccination.  When Hib vaccines were given on their own (they are now given in combination) most children vaccinated had no reaction to the vaccine.  Mild swelling and redness at the injection site was reported in about one in ten recipients.  When now given in combination studies do not reveal any increase in severe reactions.  The Hib vaccination has, at the population level, been dramatically successful in reducing the incidence of Hib meningitis and other serious bacterial infection.  A partial primary course of Hib immunisation is not effective and the full three doses of the primary schedule are important to protect up to the age of one, when the booster is needed for full protection.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to the PCV vaccine, Professor Kroll states that pneumococcal disease comprises a range of bacterial infections.  All persons are vulnerable, but children under the age of 2 years old are particularly so.  In children the commonest infection is an ear infection but germs may invade and cause much more serious diseases in the lungs by way of pneumonia, or the bloodstream by way of septicaemia and meningitis.  Pneumococcal germs can cause a particularly severe, brain damaging form of meningitis, with about half of the survivors left with some form of disability.  The disease is fatal in approximately one in ten children who are infected.  Pneumococcal meningitis is hard to diagnose and treat in time to prevent complications.  Professor Kroll opines that this issue is getting worse with the rise in anti-biotic resistant strains, making prevention by vaccination more important.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to the PCV vaccine, there are no living or dead bacteria in the PCV vaccine, but rather purified capsule polysaccharides from the thirteen commonest pneumococcal strains. There are no absolute contra-indications to a child receiving PCV immunisation other than a personal history of hypersensitivity to the vaccine.  Again, such reactions are extremely rare.  Following vaccination, most infants will be, transiently, irritable or sleepy, or briefly off feeds.  Mild swelling and redness at the injection site is common, as is transient fever.  However, such reactions do not generally contraindicate further vaccination.  The reactions are typically mild and self-limiting.  The PCV vaccine is predicted to prevent between 80 and 90 percent of invasive pneumococcal infections and has been highly effective in reducing the incidence of invasive pneumococcal infections in vaccinated children.</p>

He concludes that there is nothing in his medical history (including his diagnosed kidney abnormality) that absolutely, or relatively contraindicates immunisation, nor that would render such immunisation more likely to be ineffective than in any healthy child.  Moreover, Professor Kroll opines that the family history of infection of measles that he identifies suggests that SL lived in circumstances in which the transmission of common childhood infections occurred, meaning he should be afforded the protection conferred by the full UK immunisation schedule.</p>

Professor Kroll was accordingly also asked to consider whether there is anything in the older children&#8217;s medical records that causes him concern regarding SL receiving the disputed immunisations.  Professor Kroll, being careful to note that the abbreviated medical records provided to him may not be complete, makes clear that in none of the records he reviewed relating to SL&#8217;s siblings detail any significant adverse reaction to vaccination in general or to Hib or PCV vaccination in particular in any of the children.  Professor Kroll further opines that even had there been evidence in the medical records of some reaction, this would not, in general, constitute a medical contraindication to vaccinating SL.</p>

He further concludes that withholding the Hib and PCV vaccines for SL would mean deliberately maintaining his vulnerability, which is at its maximum given his present age, to two very serious infections which are major causes of infection, including bacterial meningitis.  Professor Kroll is clear that whilst not providing total protection, a full course of vaccination provides a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">very substantial degree</span>&#8221; of protection against these infections.  He concludes that, in his expert medical opinion, SL needs to be immunised without delay and to receive booster immunisations at the appropriate time.</p>

Parents often have to make decisions for children to meet their welfare needs, as Ms Vivian observed that is &#8216;what parenting is about'. As with many aspects of the exercise of parental responsibility, in particular as children get older, it will often require discussion and explanation by the parents of their decision to their children which may be against their wishes and feelings. This has not been possible in this case as the parents disagree and the court has been asked to step in to make the decision. The court can only make decisions on the evidence that it has in each particular case and by considering the welfare needs of each child.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I accept that Professor Kroll identifies what might be described as low grade side effects of the administering of the vaccines (mild swelling and redness at the injection site in a minority of children given the Hib vaccine and mild swelling and redness at the injection site and transient fever in children given the PCV vaccine) and a very low risk of hypersensitivity to the vaccine, he is also clear as to the grave, and potentially fatal, consequences of the diseases the vaccines are designed to prevent, including bacterial meningitis.  None of this expert evidence was disputed by the mother.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst the mother submits that risk of infection is low, and whilst the expert evidence supports that contention to a certain extent, it is plain on the evidence before the court that the consequences of that risk becoming manifest are grave indeed, with the meningitis in particular being a rapidly progressive infection, hard to diagnose and treat in time to prevent permanent damage or even death. Within this context, it is also important to note Professor Kroll&#8217;s evidence that withholding the Hib and PCV vaccines for SL would mean maintaining his vulnerability to serious infection at the point at which the risk of such infection is at its maximum given his present age.  I also place weight on Professor Kroll&#8217;s evidence that the family history of infection of measles that Professor Kroll identifies suggests that SL lived in circumstances in which the transmission of common childhood infections has occurred.  Again, none of this expert evidence was disputed by the mother.</p>

This fact further reinforces my view that the balance of risk as between administering the outstanding Hib vaccine and the PCV vaccine to SL and not doing so plainly favours immunisation.</p>

She has likewise failed to produce the records associated with these attendances as she was directed to do.  As I have already noted, the mother has not even placed before the court evidence that such records were requested.  None of the asserted instances relied on by the mother are referred to in the medical records for the children reviewed by Professor Kroll (accepting that Professor Kroll highlights the possibility that those records may be incomplete). In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the mother has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that the instances she cites in fact occurred.  In any event, the unchallenged evidence of Professor Kroll is clear that even had there been some reaction in the other children, this would not, in general, constitute a medical contraindication to vaccinating SL.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In summary, the evidence of Professor Kroll makes clear that immunisation is the only practical way to prevent SL from contracting infections each of which carries an appreciable risk of dangerous, and potentially fatal complications in a healthy child.  All the evidence before the court is that immunisation is largely (but not wholly) effective in this respect and has a very low level of side effects, which side effects are generally mild and transient.  Professor Kroll has confirmed, having reviewed his medical records, that there is no medical reason why SL should not receive the outstanding immunisations.  Even if his siblings suffered an adverse reaction to the vaccines (which, for the reasons I have already set out, is far from being established to the satisfaction of the court) such reactions are not contraindicative of SL receiving the vaccines.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied on the evidence before the court that, in relation to SL, the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks by a clear margin.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I acknowledge Ms Connolly QC and Ms Gill&#8217;s submission that parents are ordinarily accorded a significant degree of autonomy when deciding whether to have their child immunised as a function of the exercise of their parental responsibility. Whilst, historically, vaccination was compelled by law under the Vaccination Act 1853 and subsequent legislation, vaccination is not now compulsory in this jurisdiction, the Vaccination Act 1898 having introduced an exception allowing parents who did not believe vaccination was efficacious or safe to obtain a certificate of exemption (introducing the concept of the &#8220;conscientious objector&#8221; into English law) and the National Health Service Act 1946 having thereafter repealed the compulsory vaccination laws in their entirety.  However, I cannot accept Ms Connolly QC and Ms Gill&#8217;s submission that, ordinarily, a parent <span style="font-style:italic">in the position of the mother</span> (my emphasis) would get to decide whether to have a child immunised as a function of the exercise of her parental responsibility.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact that this court is required to decide whether SL should be immunised is, in this case, a function of a dispute between those who hold of parental responsibility for SL, namely the mother and the local authority (the identity of SL&#8217;s father not being known).  Where there is such a dispute the court is under an obligation to determine that dispute in accordance with the legal principles articulated above.  That determination is not an example of overreaching by the State into an area of parental choice but, rather, is an example of the court discharging its obligation to ensure the welfare of the child is safeguarded in circumstances where those charged with meeting the child&#8217;s welfare needs cannot agree on how that end is best achieved.  Again, as Theis J noted in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A, B, C and D (Welfare of Children: Immunisation)</span>, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Z (A Minor)(Freedom of Publication)</span> [1996] 1 FLR 191 Sir Thomas Bingham MR said at 217 B-C: </p>

It should certainly not be disregarded or lightly set aside.  But the role of the court is to exercise an independent and objective judgment.  If that judgment is in accord with that of the devoted and responsible parent, well and good.  If it is not, then it is the duty of the court, after giving due weight to the view of the devoted and responsible parent, to give effect to its own judgment.  That is what it is there for.  Its judgment may of course be wrong.  So may that of the parent. But once the jurisdiction of the court is invoked its clear duty is to reach and express the best judgment it can&#8221;.</p>

I have of course given very careful consideration to the mother&#8217;s objections to vaccination.  It is not difficult to see how the, albeit unrelated, events with which this court is concerned have focused her mind on the potential risks of vaccination to SL&#8217;s wellbeing.  The mother has decided that those risks outweigh the risks of not vaccinating SL. A parent is fully entitled to make a decision based on their assessment of the likelihood of infection and how severe that infection might be in terms of outcome.</p>

Indeed, that medical evaluation reaches a diametrically opposed view.  Whilst welfare is a very wide concept, and whilst the principle of best interests means more than just medical best interests, the unchallenged conclusions of the expert instructed to assist the court on the question of immunisation are, necessarily, a powerful pointer towards what is in SL&#8217;s best interests on the question of immunisation.  I must also have regard to the fact that, whilst the mother submits that her considered view is grounded in her direct experience of adverse reactions in her other children, she has not in any way evidenced the factual basis she contends grounds her reasoned evaluation of the risks on this basis, despite being given every opportunity to do so.  These matters significantly reduce the weight I am able to attach to the mother&#8217;s views in respect of the vaccination of SL as against the evidence of the expert. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I have, as I must, paid careful regard to the Art 8 right of the mother to respect for her family life.  A decision by the court (as a public authority pursuant to s 6(3)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1998) to authorise the immunisation of SL in the face of the mother&#8217;s objection, and in circumstances where parents are ordinarily accorded a significant degree of autonomy by the State when deciding whether to have their child immunised as a function of the exercise of their parental responsibility where there is no dispute, constitutes an interference in the mother&#8217;s Art 8 right to respect for family life.  For that interference to be lawful it must be justified by reference to the terms of Art 8(2).  Having regard to the evidence set out above, I am satisfied that the interference in the mother&#8217;s right to respect for family life under Art 8 constituted by a decision of this court to authorise the immunisation of SL against her wishes is in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society in the interests protecting SL&#8217;s health and, accordingly, is a justified and proportionate interference.   I am reinforced in this conclusion by the fact that a decision to authorise the immunisation of SL accords with his right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health under Art 24 of the UNCRC.</p>
