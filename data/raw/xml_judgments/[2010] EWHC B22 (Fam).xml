The local authority had been concerned about this family for several years, though it was not until June 2008 that care proceedings were finally issued. The main concerns set out in the local authority&#8217;s first threshold document can be categorised, broadly, as centring around issues of neglect. In the summer of 2009 the local authority amended its threshold document, removing most of the original allegations and adding allegations of fabricated illness.</span></p>

However, in August 2009, in the light of a report from a medical expert concerning issues of fabricated illness, the local authority sought to remove the children. Their application was refused. Three months later the local authority made a second attempt to persuade the court that the children should be removed. This time their application was withdrawn mid-hearing.</span></p>

The exercise of parallel analysis requires the court to examine the justification for interfering with each right and the issue of proportionality is to be considered in respect of each.

There is no suggestion, whether from the local authority or the parents, that identifying information has already been posted on social networking sites or, if it has, that it has caused the children any distress. However, I accept that the risk will increase if the local authority is identified.</span></p>

The children do now need time and space in which to be able to process their experiences of being part of a family that has been the subject of intense scrutiny by social workers and to adjust to some semblance of normal family life. It is for that reason that I have said that publicity would not be in their best interests. However, being identified by the community in which they live is very different from being in the media spotlight. As the father said, the children&#8217;s involvement with the local authority is already known by a whole range of professionals and others who are or have been involved in the life of the family over the years. The risk of harm from being identified by members of the local community </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">as a result</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> of naming the local authority is not the same as the risk of harm from being themselves the subject of media interest.

However, they are local issues, being specific to this local authority. The constituents of this local authority have Art 10 rights to be informed about what their local council has done. As matters stand at the moment, it is unlikely that any regional media organisation, reporting local news, could report my earlier judgment for fear that to do so would effectively disclose the local authority&#8217;s identity. In these circumstances, as she puts it, &#8216;The restriction on the Article 10 rights is therefore real.&#8217; I accept that submission.</span></p>

For this level of understanding to be achieved it would require a lot of information about the children that is not contained in the Judgment to be disclosed. In doing so the children&#8217;s welfare would be compromised. I am therefore of the view that the press will not be able to effectively present a balanced picture of the actions of the local authority, and multi-agency working, without being provided with information that would breach the children&#8217;s right to privacy and avoid any community animosity or adverse reaction.&#8217;</span></p>

All of that is undoubtedly true. It might also be said that it is not especially unusual for judges to be critical of the way particular cases have been managed by individual local authorities. Pointing out instances where local authority social workers have not complied with best practice is part of the judicial function and is important in the context of seeking to improve performance and raise standards. However, it is clear from my earlier judgment that the circumstances of this case go beyond what might be regarded as &#8216;routine&#8217; criticism of a local authority. The order for costs underlines that point. Orders for costs against local authorities are, in my experience, rare.</span></p>

Whether they take comfort or not is, with respect, of relatively low importance so far as Art 10 is concerned. What is of greater importance is the fact that, as Mr Pressdee concedes, there is a legitimate public interest in the population served by this local authority knowing of the failings highlighted in this case and being assured that the local authority has indeed taken appropriate steps to address them.</span></p>

I am not persuaded that that is a point of real substance. In the event that the local authority agreed to participate in any broadcast discussion of the court&#8217;s criticisms it would be unnecessary, in my judgment, for the local authority to descend to that level of detail in order to address the points.</span></p>

I have come to the conclusion that it is not. The residents of Coventry have the right to know that the local authority concerned in this case is Coventry City Council and the BBC has the right to report that fact. I therefore grant the BBC&#8217;s application but in doing so make it clear that in light of the contents of my earlier Press Release, Coventry City Council acted reasonably in opposing the BBC&#8217;s application on the grounds that it advanced.</span></p>
