He seeks the summary return to Romania of two children who were removed from that country to England by their mother, the respondent, on 6 February 2024. Both parties and the children are Romanian citizens and passport holders and Romania and the UK are both parties to the 1980 Convention. The children are a boy (&#8220;R&#8221;) and a girl (&#8220;S&#8221;) aged almost 10 and almost 8 years old respectively (both have birthdays in late September). The mother opposes the application.</span></p>

After the divorce, the children lived with their mother and stayed with their father for a long weekend every fortnight. As I will explain, the Romanian court proceedings remain live.</span></p>

At the end of December, he withdrew his previous consent to the children going abroad for holidays with their mother.

The father opposed that application and there was a hearing on 19 January 2024. In a written judgment delivered on 22 January 2024 (which I have read) the Romanian court dismissed the mother&#8217;s application, partly on the ground that the condition of urgency was not met. She was given 5 days within which to file any appeal. </span></p>

In analysing whether the allegations are of sufficient detail and substance, the judge will have to consider whether, to adopt what Black LJ said in Re K, "the evidence before the court enables him or her confidently to discount the possibility that the allegations give rise to an Article 13(b) risk". In making this determination, and to explain what I meant in Re C, I would endorse what MacDonald J said in Uhd v McKay (Abduction: Publicity) [2019] 2 FLR 1159, at [70], namely that "the assumptions made by the court with respect to the maximum level of risk must be reasoned and reasonable assumptions" (my emphasis).

She does not suggest that there is any aspect of R&#8217;s life in Romania that will or might expose him to that grave risk or situation of intolerability other than re-attendance at a Romanian state school. The father does not agree that R&#8217;s attendance at a Romanian state school harmed him or was as negative as the mother asserts. He submits that she is attempting to leverage R&#8217;s diagnosis with the aim of achieving in this jurisdiction the outcome she failed to obtain in the Romanian court in January 2024. </span></p>

There is no internal inconsistency in the mother&#8217;s evidence on that issue, or any other matter, that enables me confidently to discount the possibility that a return to Romanian state school gives rise to an Art 13(b) risk for R. My task then is to determine whether, if the mother&#8217;s assertions about the effect on R of Romanian state school are true, there would be a grave risk of harm or a situation of intolerability for him if he were to return to Romania.</span></p>

I also accept that the same evidence gives rise to the possibility that if, on return to Romania, R would again be required to attend a Romanian state school, he might again experience that same negative psychological impact which could be described as psychological harm.</span></p>

It follows that I do not find that there is a grave risk that R&#8217;s return to Romania would expose him to a grave risk of psychological harm or psychological harm that is grave, or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation.</span></p>

I accept that that was an open question, not a narrow and directed one asking whether he would be worried about returning to the school he was attending when he left. That said, given what Miss Callaghan reports about his thoughtful engagement during their conversation, had he found attendance at that school so awful that he could not tolerate going back there, I think it likely that he would have told her that going back there was a worry for him. </span></p>

I have to look to the future and at all of the relevant circumstances and consider the specific situation for R on return to Romania. There is, in my judgment, no prospect of him being required to re-attend Romanian state school on return. The mother has the means to pay for a place for him at School 2, or another Romanian private school. I was reminded that her ability to meet that cost herself depends on her working the two jobs I have described. However, I was not presented with any evidence to suggest that she was struggling to cope with the two jobs or that either of them was at risk. She is highly motivated to ensure that R avoids what she sees as the harmful effect on him of Romanian state school. I have no doubt that when R returns to Romania he will attend a private school for at least such time as it takes the Romanian courts to determine his best interests in relation to residence and education.</span></p>
