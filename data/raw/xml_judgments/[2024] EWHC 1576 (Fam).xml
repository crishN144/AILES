The target of his appeal was paragraph 1 of the order which provides for him to transfer to W his half share in the FMH at 9 Southcote Road, London N19 (&#8220;the FMH&#8221;). The FMH had an agreed value of &#163;1.5m such that H&#8217;s half share was &#163;750,000 (ignoring sale costs). </p>

A substantial part of the 128 paragraph judgment is devoted to the judge&#8217;s attempts to understand the financial structures. Thus, at paragraph 13 he said: &#8220;The real difficulty in this case has been the investigation and determination of complex and sophisticated trust and other financial arrangements of the husband which were not designed to be transparent. &#8230;these arrangements have generated suspicion and investigation&#8230;a coherent picture never emerged&#8221;. </p>

The precise nature of H&#8217;s relationship with this company, a vehicle set up by his solicitor and tax adviser, was not clear to the judge. In practice, however, the judge did not consider these sums would ever be repaid by H, contrary to H&#8217;s case that they should be taken into account as a liability; &#8220;&#8230;it [the debt] is not formally secured, and that fact alone suggests that the loan was not formalised to do anything more than to create an impression for tax purposes&#8221;.

Due to pressure of work, the judge was unable to complete the judgment until September 2019.  Shortly before it was delivered, however, the court&#8217;s attention was drawn by H to a number of matters which were said to affect H&#8217;s financial position. The judge thereafter allowed further written submissions and evidence and fixed 27 January 2020 for delivery of judgment. Prior to that hearing, further developments were notified to the judge, who again adjourned, this time to 4 March 2020.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is common ground that paragraph 1 of the order of HHJ Meston QC which requires H to transfer to W his 50% legal and beneficial interest in the FMH was wrong and must be set aside for the reasons set out above. In a nutshell, there was no interest to transfer as by the date of the order the interest vested in the Trustees. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The 50% interest, which it is assumed may be worth about &#163;750,000, will be largely swallowed up by the Trustees&#8217; costs which are about &#163;657,000, and will increase until everything is resolved. Any surplus will be paid pari passu to the creditors, including to W who is a creditor by reason of costs orders made against H. If, by the time of sale, the FMH sells for more than &#163;1.5m, it follows that there may be more available for the creditors (although the Trustees&#8217; costs will also be higher). </p>

That would reflect the intentions of HJ Meston QC, who provided for W to receive the entirety of the FMH. It would be the just outcome given H&#8217;s conduct in concealing the fact of his bankruptcy from W and depriving her of the opportunity to secure for herself the entirety of the FMH. </p>
