If the court considers it necessary they would accept continuous supervision by family or others, including the maternal grandfather moving in with them.  The local authority and the Children's Guardian propose that a care order is made, with C remaining with his aunt and having regular supervised contact to his parents.  They do not consider that an unsupervised return would be safe or continuous supervision viable.  In due course a special guardianship order in favour of the aunt may well be appropriate.</span></p>

If that cannot happen, consideration must be given to whether a supervised return would be in his interests.  It is common ground that, but for the injuries, all considerations favour C&#8217;s return to his parents.  However, there is a stark division of opinion between Dr Dale and the other professional witnesses as to the weight that should be given to the history of injury and the parents&#8217; response. </span></p>

Over the course of a week, he spent 17 hours with the parents, interviewing them and observing them with C.  He also interviewed the aunt and both grandfathers.  In his report, he concludes that current risk factors are not sufficient to contraindicate the reunification of C to his parents.  The indications are that the injuries took place in the context of significant and unexpected psychosocial stressors.  Such stressors are no longer applicable, and in their absence it is not likely that either parent would succumb to their coping mechanisms again being overwhelmed.  There is an absence of adverse social circumstances and significant protective factors in relation to both parents.  There is an exceptionally strong extended family support network.  C should remain with his aunt until after the criminal trial and then return in a phased way to his parents.</span></p>

She has a good relationship with all family members.  In her final statement, she notes the abundant evidence that the parents can meet C's practical needs.  They are knowledgeable, involved and committed.  However, she disagrees with Dr Dale's recommendation.  She does not consider that the stress factors that previously existed have resolved.  She was concerned that inadequate consideration has been given by Dr Dale to the actions of the parents, who in her view continue to be unable to describe their feelings or difficulties when C was at home.  Ms Kelly is concerned that there is no understanding of how such an extreme change in behaviour came about and that it is therefore impossible to know how the situation can be ameliorated in future.  Without such knowledge, C remains at risk of harm.  The parents have shown no insight into their difficulties.  Little has changed to allow the conclusion that the protective factors have increased from the time when C was injured.</span></p>

They speak of the huge effect of the family and criminal proceedings upon them.  They give assurances that C would be safe in their care and confirm their willingness to accept any form of supervision.  If C does not return home, they resist any significant reduction in the amount of contact, arguing that there is no reason to change an arrangement that is working so well.  The parents' evidence is supported in statements from both grandfathers and from C's maternal great aunt.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">In his final analysis the Guardian, Mr Dore refers to the strengths in the family system.  Both parents love C very much and have shown their commitment to him.  As a result of the high level of contact, his primary attachment is to his mother.  The large extended family has remained involved and is important to C.  There are no other concerns about the family, home conditions are good, and the parents are mutually supportive and willing to seek help.  These extensive positive factors have remained constant throughout.  However, the Guardian sees significant risks with a plan for reunification.  His view is that no level of intervention can safely protect against such unpredictable and short-lived events as occurred here.  Given the magnitude of the injuries, the fact that the loss of control occurred more than once, and the parents&#8217; inability to identify the circumstances in which it occurred, the risk of future harm remains unacceptably high.  Nor should C be returned to his parents under supervision.  This would not meet his need for stability and consistency of care.  Contact should be reduced to the level recommended by the local authority to allow C to maintain an appropriate connection with his parents, not so that they can continue to parent him at arm's length.</span></p>

This stance was unexpected, given that neither Ms Kelly nor the Guardian had written anything that could reasonably be interpreted in this way; indeed Ms Kelly had explicitly made it clear that denial does not preclude progress.  Pressed to explain, Dr Dale accepted that he had never known such a policy in any organisation and that his reason for raising the issue was</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'"> "natural curiosity about the operation of systems".</span></p>

He said that the risk of physical harm is at a very low level.  As the parents do not have personality difficulties and the injuries were not the result of cruelty he did not see a risk in C&#8217;s return with this level of family support.  An explosive reaction is highly unlikely.  There is no need for supervision but  the presence of the grandfather in the home would reduce the risk of harm to a negligible level.</span></p>

Asked whether there was no real possibility of further injury to C, he said that he could not say that it was not a possibility but he did not think it was likely.  The lack of high-level stress factors in the context of informed family support and C not presenting the same parenting challenges led him to this conclusion.</span></p>

Despite the extensive, sympathetic family network and the many sympathetic social workers and lawyers who have been available to the parents, there is no hint of which parent injured C, so that he or she can be helped to avoid a repetition.  There is no hint of how much the parent who did not cause the injury knew about what was happening, so that he or she might be helped to act protectively in future.  The court is in the dark.  </span></p>

They gave appropriate weight to the many positives and faced up squarely to the risks as they saw them.  They paid careful attention to  Dr Dale&#8217;s opinions, to a degree that was unfortunately not always reciprocated.  Their evidence was careful, lucid and child-focused and I accept it.  </span></p>

I do not accept his assertion that there has been significant change in the overall circumstances since C was last at home so that the stresses have significantly reduced.  Those circumstances were not abnormally stressful in themselves and the demands of looking after a toddler would not be very different.  Nor do I accept that either parent has shown or given any insight into the nature of the situation that proved so dangerous to C.  In fact, Dr Dale&#8217;s enquiries did not elicit any new information at all, yet he gives no weight to this marked feature of the case.</span></p>

The greatest risk is self-evidently one of repeated injury, but Dr Dale was notably avoidant in relation to this question and even affected not to know what harm the local authority apprehended.  I do not consider that he directly addressed the serious risks that are inherent in this case, his circumlocution being symptomatic.  He repeatedly shifted his ground when his initial formulations were tested.  His use of statistics, when explored, was found to be lacking in content.  His reliance on the fact that no failure to protect was found was puzzling when the reason for the court&#8217;s inability to consider the issue is properly understood.</span></p>

		  <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.12in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Dr Dale's attempt to discredit the competing professional opinions was disappointing.  There was not the slightest pretext for him to have suggested that his colleagues approached their task on the basis of a policy or an inadmissible premise.  Nor was there any justification for querying their experience or the length of time that they have spent on the case.   In fact, Ms Kelly has known the parents through thick and thin for well over a year and in my assessment she knows this family better than any other professional, without letting her judgement of C&#8217;s welfare become unbalanced.</span></p>

The alarming extent of the previous injuries and the almost complete absence of any explanation makes it impossible to reach any other conclusion.  The lack of information is so striking that, as Mr Loveridge puts it, it is almost impossible to make a more closely reasoned assessment of risk.  </span></p>

Information is offered to them in abundance but, for whatever reason, nothing is offered by them.  Instead, the situation has been reached the point where meaningful discussion of the possibility that one or other of them has injured C has become impossible.  The topic is so emotionally charged for the parents that it has effectively become a no-go area for them and other family members.  Neither parent is even able to accept that there is a real possibility that C was injured by the other.  The psychological roots for this state of affairs are hidden from view.  The situation is profoundly worrying and I have no confidence that either parent would be consistently and reliably protective in relation to a risk that might arise in any way and at any time.</span></p>

However, for the reasons more fully given by Ms Kelly and the Guardian I do not consider that this would be right for C.  I accept that the continuous presence of a family member would go some way towards reducing the likelihood of serious physical harm, but it would be wholly artificial to expect C to grow up under such conditions.  There is a great difference between a multigenerational family household and an arrangement where neither parent can be allowed to be alone with a child.</span></p>

I will also approve the proposal for a phased reduction of supervised contact to twice-weekly.  The local authority will consider contact levels on an ongoing basis.  There is every reason for flexibility in planning in this unusual situation and if it is concluded that the proposed level is too little or too much, different arrangements will no doubt be made in discussion with the family.</span></p>
