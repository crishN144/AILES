The judgment was handed down in open court and sent by me to BAILII. The front sheet of the judgment as handed down stated in bold type that &#8220;This judgment was handed down in open court&#8221;. The front sheet did <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>contain the rubric which often appears on judgments of the Family Division or the Family Court.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><marker name="tab"/>The current version of the rubric is as follows: &#8220;This judgment was delivered in private. The judge has given leave for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published version of the judgment the anonymity of the children and members of their family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court.&#8221;</p>

However, it has been recognised ever since the decision in 1988 of Sir Stephen Brown P in <span style="font-style:italic">Re W and others (Wards) (Publication of Information) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1989] 1 FLR 246" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1989">[1989] 1 FLR 246</ref>, that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> does not of itself prevent publication of the names of the child or of anyone else involved in the proceedings. The identity of the child is protected in certain circumstances by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/97/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 97(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> but even then only so long as the proceedings remain on foot: <span style="font-style:italic">Clayton v Clayton </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2006/878" uk:canonical="[2006] EWCA Civ 878" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWCA Civ 878</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] Fam 83" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] Fam 83</ref>. So, the conditions attached to the judge&#8217;s permission to publish a judgment handed down in private frequently include restrictions on identifying the child or others.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The rubric is not an injunction &#8230; It is not drafted in the way in which injunctions are usually drafted. There is no penal notice. And the procedures required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/12/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 12(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> and the President&#8217;s Practice Direction (Applications for Reporting Restriction Orders) will not have been complied with. But this does not mean that it is unenforceable and of no effect. On the contrary, it is, in my judgment, binding on anyone who seeks to make use of a judgment to which it is attached. And anyone who disobeys it is, in principle, guilty of a contempt of court.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">The rubric is in two parts and serves two distinct functions. The first part, &#8216;the judge hereby gives leave for it to be reported&#8217; has the effect, as it were, of disapplying <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 12</ref> pro tanto, and thereby immunising the publisher or reporter from proceedings for contempt. But the second part, &#8216;the judgment is being distributed on the strict understanding that&#8230;&#8217; makes that permission conditional. A person publishing or reporting the judgment cannot take advantage of the judicial permission contained in the first part of the rubric, and will not be immunised from the penal consequences of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 12</ref>, unless he has complied with the requirements of the second part of the rubric. This is merely an application of a familiar principle which one comes across in many legal contexts and which finds expression in such aphorisms as that you cannot take the benefit without accepting the burden, that you cannot approbate and reprobate and that if a thing comes with conditions attached you take it subject to those conditions.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>So someone who publishes or reports such a judgment in a way which does not comply with the second part of the rubric will, in principle, be guilty of a contempt of court: not that species of contempt committed by someone who breaches an injunction &#8211; because, to repeat, the rubric is not an injunction &#8211; but contempt in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 12</ref>.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">The text of the current version of the rubric is, as we have seen, somewhat different.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Now none of this has any application to a judgment handed down <span style="font-style:italic">in public</span>. The rubric in its standard form applies, as a matter of language, only to judgments handed down in private. But there is a more fundamental point in play here. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 12</ref> (which applies only to reports of &#8220;proceedings before [a] court sitting in private&#8221;) does not apply to the contents of a judgment handed down in public. Nor, as a quite separate point, does anyone need a judge&#8217;s permission to publish or report a judgment given or handed down in public, unless, that is, there is in place, and there was not here, some specific injunctive or other order preventing publication. It will thus be seen that there was no basis for my including the rubric in my judgment. As I said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re RB</span> (para 20):</p>

The birth parents were named and a link was given to a contemporaneous newspaper report of the proceedings in the Crown Court which had reported the birth parents as indicating that they would be launching a fight to recover their child. I make absolutely clear that suesspiciousminds.com was fully entitled to publish what it did and cannot, and should not, be criticised for doing so. Publication of the birth parents&#8217; names, and repetition of the material which was already in the public domain, was prohibited neither by statute nor by order. I understand that, following an approach by one of the advocates, suesspiciousminds.com removed the names of the birth parents and the link. That, of course, was entirely a matter for suesspiciousminds.com. I merely record the facts in the interests of transparency.</p>

The Press Association reporter, Mr Brian Farmer, was present throughout much of the hearing.

I was not surprised to receive later that afternoon, after I had made the order, an email from Mr Mike Dodd, the legal editor of the Press Association, drawing attention to the fact that:</p>

The local authority was represented by Mr Michael Liebrecht, the birth parents, as previously, by Ms Martha Cover and Ms Katy Rensten, the adoptive parents, as before, by Ms Deirdre Fottrell QC, and X, as previously, by Mr Christopher Archer. Mr Farmer, the Press Association reporter, was present. He handed in a most helpful written Submission by the Press Association dated 15 June 2016 prepared by Mr Dodd (which dealt, amongst other matters, with the important issue referred to in the final sentence of my previous judgment, the reporting of the re-hearing). Mr Farmer also addressed me orally.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Liebrecht and Ms Fottrell drew attention to the stress for the adoptive parents brought about by these proceedings and to the need to ensure that this did not cause disruption or detriment to X. Ms Fottrell described, in detail which I do not propose to put into the public domain, the immense distress and anxiety that the adoptive parents have experienced since being notified of the appeal and the enormous pressure on them. They have, she says, and who can blame them, felt helpless and threatened. She submits that, whatever the outcome of any proceedings, X must be protected from exposure and intrusion, whether direct or indirect. X is entitled, she says, to respect for X&#8217;s right to private life. Both on a micro level &#8211; in the day to day world in which X lives &#8211; and on the macro level of the public at large, X should not be identified or identifiable. Ms Fottrell recognises the public interest in the court being transparent and open about what is going on in this case. But, she submits, this objective has been properly achieved by the publication of my earlier judgment which, she says, provides sufficient detail to allow for public discussion and debate. Despite the extensive reporting of the criminal proceedings and the amount of material which is, in consequence, in the public domain, there is, she submits, no need for either X or the adoptive parents to be identified and every reason why they should not be. </p>

But there is, in my judgment, a principled and well-founded reason for maintaining their anonymity at least for the time being. </p>

In the unusual circumstances of this case that impact will fall, albeit indirectly, on the adoptive parents, and therefore X, as well as on the birth parents. There is, as it seems to me, and for the reasons articulated by Mr Dodd and Mr Farmer, no principled basis for protecting the anonymity of the birth parents in their interests or for their sake; the only justification for preserving their anonymity in the short term, and I accept that there is such justification, is the pressing need to protect X, and also the adoptive parents, from the enhanced glare of publicity in the interim. </p>

Identification of the birth parents will only add to the overall intrusiveness and the distress involved for the adoptive parents and X.</p>

He emphasised, as I do, the obligations placed on applicants for a RRO and, in particular, the need to comply meticulously with the requirements I have referred to in paragraph 10 above. Mr Dodd says that the failure to give proper notification to the media is a continuing problem. If that is so, then it is a matter of considerable concern.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, there is a matter raised  by Mr Farmer during the hearing on 16 June 2016, namely that, in the copy of the local authority&#8217;s application sent to the Press Association, X&#8217;s name and date of birth had been obliterated. How, he asked rhetorically, can the media know whether or not to oppose the application if the identity of the relevant child is concealed? In this connection he referred me to the important judgment of Newton J in <span style="font-style:italic">A Healthcare NHS Trust v P (by his litigation friend, the Official Solicitor) and Q</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2015/15" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCOP 15" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCOP 15</ref>. I share Mr Farmer&#8217;s puzzlement. Obviously, the media must be able to identify who the application relates to. Often this will require the name of the child to be spelt out in the application (though not necessarily the precise date of birth), but not always. Thus in the present case it was both unnecessary and would have been wholly inappropriate to refer to X by X&#8217;s present name or to specify X&#8217;s date of birth. The legitimate needs of the media at that stage would have been fully met by referring to X either as &#8220;the child born in [year] formerly known as [name prior to adoption]&#8221; or as &#8220;the child born in [year] the subject of the proceedings referred to in the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X (A Child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/1342" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 1342 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 1342 (Fam)</ref>.&#8221;</p>

There was, in my judgment, no need to do so; their address could also have been given as c/o their solicitors or as a confidential address notified to the court. </p>

Those drafting applications for a RRO need to remember that information set out in the application may not be known to the media; indeed, as happened in at least one case in which I was involved when at the Bar the making of an application for a RRO may alert the media to a &#8216;story&#8217; of which they were previously quite unaware &#8211; with what may be unfortunate implications and ramifications if the RRO being sought is not, in the event, granted.   </p>
