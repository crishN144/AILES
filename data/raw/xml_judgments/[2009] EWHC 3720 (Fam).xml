The other children were subsequently admitted to hospital for medical examination. It rapidly became clear that K had starved to death. She had succumbed to pneumonia as the end stage of starvation, her immune system having become hopelessly compromised. All the other children were suffering from malnutrition to a greater or lesser extent.  Had there not been medical intervention I am satisfied that Z, who on admission to hospital was in a critical condition, would also have died.  L was in serious danger. In addition to being seriously malnourished each of the children had to varying degrees, been beaten by an implement which had left tramline like marks on their bodies. </p>

It is quite impossible from the evidence as it presently stands to make any findings as to the comings and goings between the mother and the father. Mother has been consistent in making allegations of domestic violence and there are contemporaneous records of the mother making complaints of violence both during and after the relationship. </p>

The court has been told that the father disagrees in certain respects with J&#8217;s account of how he became involved with the mother but the father&#8217;s evidence has not been tested. The Intervenor says the father asked him to look after the mother and to take the children to and from school when the father took his new wife to Spain. JA for his part says that the father gave him his Rover motorcar to enable him to undertake the task that he had been set. Whatever the precise history may or may not be, JA gradually became more and more involved in the life of the mother and the children, initially doing the school run and helping with the shopping and gradually becoming ever more part of their lives. Both JA and the mother accept that from a religious point of view their relationship was wholly improper. </p>

Her religion is of considerable importance to her and she is acutely conscious of her lack of depth of knowledge and understanding of the teaching of Islam and of the Koran. As a consequence she looked entirely to JA to be told, as she put it, &#8220;what was required&#8221; by her religion and for an understanding of the scriptures. She unquestioningly accepted his interpretation of how the family should live on a day to day basis in order to be good Muslims. In fact although his religion is equally important to JA and he is by his own rights strictly observant, his own knowledge of the scriptures was also limited. The result was that JA received a misplaced deference to his supposed learning within the household. This impacted in a punitive way: for example, when JA accused the mother of being insufficiently observant she responded by putting her little girls in full Islamic robes even though this was not a religious or cultural requirement at such a young age. </p>

His behaviour can be challenging and he attended a special school. Both K and L had statements of special educational needs and Z had an independent educational plan to cater for his special needs. Despite their respective ages both K and L were in nappies at night and I am satisfied that K&#8217;s enuresis was a major issue. The mother was dissatisfied with where she was living. She wished to move and to leave the area, but the children had drawn all over the walls of the house and the mother had been told by her landlord that there would be no move until the house was tidied up. Money was short and the mother had got into substantial debt with various catalogues. </p>

The chart is standard and has lines printed on it known as centile lines. A child is weighed and the weight is marked on the chart using graph axes for age and weight or height. So, for example, in M&#8217;s case in March 2007 when he was approaching seven years of age, his weight of 23.8 kilograms put him on the 75<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile on the growth charts.

He did therefore gain a small amount of weight but as a child of seven he should be growing and should be putting on weight and that tiny weight gain actually meant that he had fallen from the 75<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile for weight. </p>

This does not mean that they are fat (although sometimes children can initially overshoot until their weight settles down), but what is seen on the growth chart is that they are pushing back through the centile lines to regain the trajectory where he or she as a healthy, well fed child is constitutionally suited. Once again using M as an example, when he was removed from the care of his mother he gained significant amounts of weight so that by 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2008, only ten weeks later, he had crossed from the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> to the 50<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile.</p>

M was holding up his trousers with his hands because he had lost so much weight and the staff, on Mr Q&#8217;s instructions, started to look for marks on his body when he was undressing for swimming. He raised his concerns with the Deputy Head and the matter was transferred to the school nurse. She weighed him and noted that his weight was between the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 50<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile having been previously on the 75<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and that the mother was restricting his diet. </p>

The doctor, Dr A, saw mother who attended with JA and the other children. I am satisfied that this was a difficult and tense meeting. Miss O&#8217;S, the school nurse, described it. She made a passing remark to the children on the lines of &#8220;what, no school today?&#8221; which was met with the mother snapping at her that it was no concern of hers. JA was not introduced. The head teacher was present which I am told, and accept, was an indication of the level of concern felt by the school for M. </p>

Subsequently during the course of the trial he became deeply distressed and arrangements were made for him to be medically examined by his psychiatrist, Dr K. It was important for the court to ascertain whether or not he was fit to give evidence. Dr K having examined him said that he was and he accordingly went into the witness box. During his evidence JA made extensive and detailed admissions to the court, revealing a harsh and cruel environment and confirming the allegations the children had made. </p>

Downstairs there were two rooms and a kitchen. The mother, as I have already indicated, was unable to obtain a transfer of her tenancy until such time as the house was decorated. The children had drawn all over the walls, an indicator perhaps of the struggle mother was having in controlling the children before JA moved in. </p>

All the children were now sleeping in the upstairs bedroom together.  This was bad enough, but there was only one double mattress for all of them to share. The floors were bare wood and there were no sheets on the mattress. In addition to the mattress there were a few old cushions against which the children lay. The children&#8217;s toys had all been thrown out. The Mother blamed the children saying that they had said that they did not need toys and all that was left were a few jigsaws. </p>

The Mother said that it was her intention to buy the children each a chair bed to sleep on. Again in contrast to the conditions in which the children slept, the mother and JA were sleeping on a newly purchased sofa bed with appropriate bed linen. </p>

If they had been able to get into the kitchen during the day they would have done so. They were ravenously hungry. The medical evidence is that they were deprived of food for many months and this is accepted by J.

It was striking that in all the days of evidence the court heard not one word of love or affection for K from her mother. Always it seemed to me, she was spoken of critically; that she would deliberately wet herself, that she had tantrums, that she was difficult. No allowance seemed to be made for her age or for her very significant learning difficulties. It is hard to imagine what it must have been like for K: JA said that she wet herself and that he would therefore hit her with a stick and put her outside. Her mattress was thrown out when she got urine on it.  In the witness box her mother spoke of her resentfully on several occasions, for example, she that she did not believe that K had a Djinn. &#8220;She has always been difficult&#8221; she said. </p>

As a result although Z should not have been able to eat too freely, the staff and (understandably) the nurses on the ward, felt totally unable emotionally to deal with the situation in which they found themselves and Z was allowed to eat too much too soon. As a consequence Z quickly manifested what is known as Re-feeding Syndrome. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">Re-feeding Syndrome was first described in the Far Eastern prisoners of war cases after the Second World War. It is seen following starvation when the fat and protein stores in the body are broken down to produce energy. This leads to changes to the level of some of the salts in the body and particularly phosphate. When the individual starts to feed the body switches back to using carbohydrate to provide energy this causes an increase in insulin levels and a flow of phosphate into cells. This can lead to profoundly low blood phosphate levels which in turn can produce the clinical features of Re-feeding Syndrome. These include muscle breakdown, increased risk of infection, respiratory failure and heart failure. Professor M, when giving his evidence, said that often with prisoners of war after the Second World War, when the prisoners starting eating again they simply dropped down dead. There is no doubt that the Re-feeding Syndrome could have been fatal for Z. </p>

The appropriate average BMI for L would have been 17.5. Hers was measured at 13.7.  She had four linear marks across her legs.

The treats of chocolate and crisps that were seen in the food diary kept after the children were taken into care would only have made a difference if sustained over a long period.

Sufficiences of all three are necessary for full bodily function and can be called X. In addition the body needs to grow as well as function. The body needs growth, being Y. A growing healthy child therefore needs both X and Y. When a child or a person becomes undernourished X goes relatively swiftly. If nutrition continues to be insufficient Y goes down as well and the child stops growing. That, he said, takes four to six months. The changes will not be seen in linear growth in under two months. This effect is seen in medical malabsorption cases where there is a time lag but once the body runs out of these nutrients it stops growing. Thereafter a child in the chronic phase of malnutrition will continue to lose weight but their height will also become stunted. </p>

When protein and energy are particularly deficient it may be referred to as protein energy malnutrition. This he explained is further divided into marasmus where protein and energy are equally deficient and kwashiorkor where protein as a source of energy is in particular deficient. The means of assessing and grading protein malnutrition is via what is known as the Waterlow classification with grade 1 being the least severe stage of malnutrition and grade 3 the most severe.  K, he said, suffered from marasmus and was grade 3 on the Waterlow classification. </p>

This would tie in with A&#8217;s evidence that his mother was trying to feed her and that she was &#8220;chewing whilst she was asleep&#8221; and also the mother&#8217;s evidence that she was trying to force feed her semolina. </p>

In response Professor M pointed out that at post mortem K&#8217;s liver showed marked acute atrophy. Professor M commented by reference to a paper by a Dr Portman that the pattern of liver alteration is in keeping with marasmus, a nutritional liver disease, which Dr Portman says, is seen in protein energy malnutrition.

The mother I am satisfied was aggressive and the conversation heated. The mother demanded to know &#8220;who Miss M thought she was&#8221;, peering through her letterbox. She threatened to take her to court for invading her privacy and she told her she was in breach of EU law. Miss M explained to the mother that as an educational welfare officer she needed to conduct a home visit. The mother, she said, simply shouted over her and was not listening. Miss M said in evidence that she was obliged to bring the conversation to an end. I accept the evidence of Miss M about the nature of this call which I find followed the pattern of a number of mother&#8217;s exchanges with professionals where she raised her voice, was aggressive and refused to listen to what was being said to her.</p>

So concerned was she by the aggressive nature of her conversation with the mother that Miss M suggested to Mr H that in the event that he was to carry out a home visit he should take a second person with him. Miss M asked Mr H whether or not the children should stay on the school register and Mr H confirmed that they should until such time as home schooling had been authorised.

A referral had been accepted which, contrary to Miss G&#8217;s initial evidence, related not only to education but to serious welfare issues and Miss G on her own account was aware of the issues which had been raised by the school. Put at its baldest, at the very least a proper initial assessment should have been completed. The children had been withdrawn from school and the mother thereafter had been reluctant (at best) to allow the children to be seen. Added to this there was an unknown male in the house with the six young children in circumstances where he was refusing to identify himself.</p>

A serious case review is currently being conducted and no doubt the social services and educational welfare involvement will be analysed in a way that is not open to this court.

Merely looking at the photographs of the house and the conditions in which the children were living confirms in my mind that had social services even seen the bedroom in which the children lived or the Mer in which they were fed, they would undoubtedly have intervened.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in">It may well be the role of a psychiatrist or a psychologist to determine whether the mother is blocking out the horror of what she allowed to happen to her children. As matters stand at the conclusion of the evidence she is maintaining an indefensible stance. All the medical experts, including the four instructed on her behalf, are united in saying that K died from complications brought about by malnutrition. The mother continues to put forward the far fetched proposition that K died of food poisoning caused by mouldy bread which she may or may not have eaten probably some three months previously. She makes no attempt to explain why if that is the case, the other five children were all malnourished, save to denying that that was the case in the teeth of the medical and photographic evidence. </p>

The evidence from the children&#8217;s schools and indeed from the grandmother and her sister show a pleasant, caring woman whose life centred around her children following the breakdown of her marriage. Only after JA moved in did she seem to become difficult and aggressive to outsiders, particularly the school, she even as I find excluded her own mother who hitherto had been of considerable support. I have no hesitation in finding, as I have already indicated, that the mother welcomed J&#8217;s new strict regime at the beginning as she was finding it increasingly difficult to control her children. </p>

Had she fed them they would have not had to steal food. Managing four of the children at home every day and making some attempt to teach them was always going to be a mammoth task. </p>

Without looking at the photographs it is hard to imagine the general chaos of the house and the contrast between the mother and J&#8217;s room and the squalor of the children&#8217;s room.  Mother and JA became exhausted and fraught and less and less patient with the children. The children in turn must have been bored. They were having no exercise and no stimulation. It is clear from the evidence and from the mother&#8217;s own account, that they were getting increasingly demanding as they scrapped with each other and were undoubtedly miserable because they were hungry. </p>

The fact remains that she did nothing to prevent or to stop his brutal treatment of her children and I find that she was fully well aware of what went on and to a lesser degree treated the children in a very similar way. She hit them with flip-flops, put them &#8220;in detention&#8221; and put them outside if they were naughty, in addition she routinely deprived them of food and on occasional force fed them. </p>

The death of K was no single episode of momentary loss of self-control such as the courts are all too familiar in the so called baby shaking cases. This was sustained and punitive brutality to very young children over many months of a type which thankfully is virtually unheard of in this country. </p>
