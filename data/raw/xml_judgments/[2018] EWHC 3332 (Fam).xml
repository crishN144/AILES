Even worse, the proceedings were not issued until 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2018 when the child was already aged two and a half months. Thus, an application based on a threshold of dubious validity was applied for later than it should have been, and the delay has been damaging both to the child and to her mother. I accordingly gave leave to the local authority to withdraw the proceedings, which I shall formally dismiss at the end of this judgment, and to issue an application under Part 19 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 as contemplated by Rule 14.2(1) of the FPR for the invoking of the inherent jurisdiction of the court and directions. </p>

The mother says that she was unaware that she was pregnant until her waters broke although &#8211; and the evidence is unclear &#8211; she may have had suspicions in the days before birth that she was pregnant.

The mother immediately concluded that she could not care for C and that the best outcome for C would be that she should be placed in a home where she would be loved and would flourish. That course of action was agreed by the maternal grandmother and her husband with whom live the mother, her older brother and the mother&#8217;s young half brother, he being the child of the maternal grandmother and her second husband. </p>

Currently the knowledge of the birth is limited, as I understand it, to the mother, the maternal grandmother and her parents, her stepfather, the maternal grandfather, the mother&#8217;s elder brother and one close friend of the mother who lives at the far end of the country. That is just eight people along with the involved professionals. There is no evidence that this group has been other than watertight. </p>

He has confirmed her capacity and her ability to fully engage in proceedings and give instructions.  The mother has been present at and followed attentively all hearings. She is plainly a young woman of considerable potential.  On the Wechsler intelligence scale for children on two of the six tests she produced a score of very high ability, two were high/average and two were average, all in the bracket between the 55<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile and the 96<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile for achievement. She is described by Dr. S as intellectually very capable and presented as articulate and thoughtful. She is still at school and wants to continue her studies and go to university. No other pupil knows that she has had a baby, the story having been given out that she has had and is recovering from appendicitis.  </p>

On at least three occasions over the last four years, all of them before C&#8217;s birth, she has cut herself. Dr. S was unaware of this when he reported but he said in oral evidence that that is likely to be more a symptom of distress or stress rather than an attempt on her own life.  </p>

In particular, she is convinced that the father will harass her and her family if he was to discover. She is concerned that he might physically harm her. He has a bad history of anti-social and criminal behaviour, to which I will return. He has not been violent to her in the past but her perception is that he may be violent to her if he knows of the birth. Whether or not she is correct is speculation, but no one suggests that her fears are not genuine. Secondly, she would lose her privacy because the information would be leaked by the father or his family. She fears that he or they will tell people in the neighbourhood and at school.  Her ability to study and achieve would be destroyed. Her hopes and dreams of returning to normality would be dashed and she would be unable to put the trauma behind her.  </p>

She wondered whether the mother was suffering from PTSD. Dr. S describes the mother&#8217;s condition as worsening through the period from his first meeting to his second meeting and then his third discussion by way of telephone call. The mother is now on antidepressants. Her mood has declined, unsurprisingly says Dr. S, as anxiety thrives on situations of uncertainty. </p>

The mother&#8217;s elder brother, who was in the father&#8217;s year at school, has been particularly affected and the relationship between the mother and her brother has severely deteriorated. The adults in her life feel let down by the mother. Relationships are gradually improving but they are likely to deteriorate if the father is told, not just because of their feelings and fears about him but also because of course if the mother had not innocently mentioned his name to a social worker none of these current difficulties would have emerged. </p>

Either the child will not be placed with the paternal family or will be. If not placed with the paternal family that may lead to anger within the paternal family towards the maternal family because (a) the child will not be placed with the paternal family because of what the maternal family have told people about the paternal family or, (b) of their anger that the maternal family is not stepping up to the mark as they perceive it. If the child were to be placed with the paternal family C will find herself in a situation where she is in a society and living close by her mother who will want nothing to do with her. What, it is asked, would the impact of that be on C? </p>

First, I fully subscribe to the principle that the remedy sought by the mother is exceptional and the circumstances needed to justify that outcome have to be exceptional, but that does not mean that there has to be one magnetic factor. The combination of circumstances, none in themselves exceptional, may, when aggregated, satisfy the test. Secondly, in considering whether the test is met one needs to conduct a holistic exercise considering all the circumstances. This includes an assessment, imperfect though it will necessarily be, of what the paternal family is likely to be able to offer. Thirdly, the fact that the mother could, if she had known, have declined to name the father and thus avoid this problem with which she and the court are now faced is not a relevant factor, although its impact on the mother may be relevant. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.01in">In my assessment there seems no ground for a realistic belief that the paternal family would be able to offer C a safe and secure home. Neither the father nor his parents appear a realistic option.  In my judgment, it is not part of the exercise that I have to conduct to consider what a relative who may be interested but of whom nothing whatsoever is known might possibly be an option. I have mentioned the uncle but not even his name or where he lives is known. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.13in">I draw comfort from the fact that sufficient is known about the paternal family to provide details for a life story book and the later life letter. That means that C will have the means to seek out her father in the future if she wishes so to do. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In reaching this decision I have taken into account the Article 8 rights of both the parents but, most importantly, C. I have not taken the mother&#8217;s objections to the father being told at face value without analysis and it is significant that the views of the harm that the mother might suffer are supported by Dr. S, by her school pastoral tutor and the counsellor with whom she works, and that her complaints about the father and his family have been supported by local authority social service files relating to the paternal family. </p>
