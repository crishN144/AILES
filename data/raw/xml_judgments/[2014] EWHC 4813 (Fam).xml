Firstly, the experienced representation that has been before the court, both in relation to the applicant and the children&#8217;s Guardian.  Miss Cronin and Miss Cavanagh have filed skeleton arguments that have been of the highest quality. They have been of enormous assistance to the court, and the thoroughness of those documents has enabled the court to give a relatively full </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">ex tempore</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> judgment today.</span></p>

Miss Day was X&#8217;s guardian in the previous proceedings; that continuity and wider viewpoint to these proceedings has been extremely helpful. That has been borne out by the perceptive analysis that she has included in her report. </span></p>

He is an enormously experienced social worker. His level of expertise is unique in my experience.  He has been a field social worker for 37 years, with 6 years on top of that wealth of experience in undertaking assessment reports of this nature.  The court is truly fortunate to have been the recipient of that wealth of expertise. His inquiries in both the previous and in these proceedings have displayed perceptive and sensitive insight as to the issues in the case.  His report, if I may say so, is a model of its kind.  It is detailed, well-evidenced, well-structured, fair and balanced and I have absolutely no hesitation in accepting the evidential conclusions that he reaches in that report. </span></p>

For the purposes of this case I will use the summary in Miss Cronin&#8217;s skeleton argument in relation to the background.  X&#8217;s parents were married in country C in 1996.  X was born in June. DE&#8217;s name is entered on X&#8217;s birth certificate. The parties have pragmatically worked on the basis that under country C&#8217;s law DE has parental responsibility for X, and we should treat him as such within these proceedings.</span></p>

He has remarried and lives there with his second wife and their two children, aged 10 and 7.  When DE left, X&#8217;s mother became solely responsible for X&#8217;s physical, emotional and financial requirements and needs.  DE did not provide any financial support; this was provided by the mother together with X&#8217;s maternal grandmother, who has been a significant feature in X&#8217;s life.  Although X has had occasional contact with   DE, via electronic mail, she has not physically seen him since 2008.  Notwithstanding that, from then until now both AB and her mother have encouraged her to maintain contact with him, and have offered to pay for him to either visit X in country A or for X to visit him with his family.  The reality is that for a very significant period of time DE has had no role in X&#8217;s care and development, and has certainly had no parental role during that period of time. </span></p>

In 2013 there were difficulties with AB&#8217;s employment and business interests. Characteristically, he has been able to dust himself down following that difficulty and has established his own company. According to his discussions with Mr. Metcalfe in July 2014, he feels the corner has been turned and he has been able to re-establish his financial and business interests on a more secure footing. </span></p>

Whilst on the whole they have been spent at one of their homes in country A, the United Kingdom or country B, there have been occasions also when they have been on holiday. For example, in the summer of 2013 when they went, for AB and CD&#8217;s marriage, to Cyprus and also in February of this year when X spent that half-term holiday staying with one of her teachers in country B, because AB was committed dealing with his business interests. Apart from that, it is clear the evidence establishes that during the summer of 2013, save for the time spent in Cyprus for AB and CD&#8217;s wedding, the summer holidays were spent at either the family home in country A, or country B.  In the October half-term the family came over to this jurisdiction to enable them to be able to see members of the family, and in Christmas 2013 they spent time together in their family home in country A.  In February of this year X spent that holiday in country B, staying with her teacher and in the Easter holidays AB and X spent that time together in their home in country B.  It was during that visit that they drove to town S as a result of the sale of a property that AB owned there.  He went off, I think, for a one day visit for a business meeting in city Z.  Then in the summer 2014 the family spent this time together in the United Kingdom based at their home in the local authority area, although they were able to move around to be able to meet and spend time with the wider family as described in the statements.</span></p>

Miss Cronin makes the point in her skeleton argument that the threshold in relation to the shared home requirement is set out in order &#8220;to ensure that the child has spent sufficient time living with the applicant in a home environment to enable the court to be satisfied that they are sufficiently well matched for the adoption to be likely to be successful.&#8221; Those are the observations of Moore-Bick L.J. in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re A (a child) (Adoption)</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 3 WLR 1169" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 3 WLR 1169</ref>.

I do not agree with that in the particular context of this case because when one looks at the overall picture, the important issue is to be able to see whether X has been living in a home environment with AB.  Whilst predominantly that has been in homes that AB owns or rents, they have also been in a home environment when they have been on holiday or been visiting other members of the family.  </span></p>

It is quite clear, in the context of this case, that X has had her home with the applicant in the period of the six months preceding the application, save when she has been at school.  This has to be looked at, as I have already said, in the context of this case; where X attends boarding school during the term time, and this is a family that have a number of properties in different jurisdictions.  They travel extensively.  I also have to take on board the restrictions in relation to CD&#8217;s ability to be able to take leave, other than the periods permitted by her employment.  It is quite clear from the detailed evidence filed that X&#8217;s integration into AB&#8217;s family and the obvious care and concern he has for her have grown considerably.  All the evidence points to X seeing AB as her father.  This is borne out by the wealth of material from X and AB, and is supported by other material, including letters from AB&#8217;s mother, sister, her partner and his brother.  All of these attest to the strength of the relationship between AB and X, and how she is very much regarded as one of the family.  For those reasons I am satisfied that that gateway requirement is met. </span></p>

He has strong views about many topics and does not suffer fools gladly.  I have met him on nine occasions and I have certainly changed my view of him since my first interaction.  This came via an exchange of emails when he first made inquiries regarding adopting X.  After learning of his circumstances I suggested to him that due to his living arrangements and the fact that X did not reside with him may mean that he did not meet the requirements within the adoption legislation to submit an application to adopt X.  AB responded by suggestion that I should &#8216;think out of the box&#8217;.  After further exchanges it became clear that AB&#8217;s memory of his previous experience of step-parent adoption was either very different than today&#8217;s requirements; or that his memory had faded significantly. As our relationship has developed I found AB to be a committed and determined parent of X, and a fierce advocate for her.    I have not had the opportunity to observe AB in the company of other children, so it is difficult for me to comment on how he generally relates to children and vice versa. I have, however, been in the company of him and X on five occasions and have observed just how relaxed and comfortable X is in his company. I have listened to them have serious conversations and have seen the assertive side of X&#8217;s character without there being any recriminations.  I have also seen and heard them laughing and joking and felt the warmth of their relationship.  Judith informs me that if X has a problem it is to AB who X returns to.&#8221;  </span></p>

On the one hand X is enthusiastic of the proposition and has expressed clear views directly to myself that she &#8216;really really wants this&#8217;.  The order would enhance her sense of belonging to AB&#8217;s family and formalise the existing affectionate and valued relationship between them.   Further, an order would enable her to gain all the rights and benefits available to a British citizen and ensure that she was legally recognised as a child of AB and CD&#8217;s marriage.  In acting as Guardian to any child or young person my role is two-fold.  Not only am I required to consider the wishes and feelings of the young person concerned, but also evaluate their welfare needs in conjunction with their expressed views.  This is sometimes difficult for the young person and their families to comprehend as welfare evaluation is a complex exercise and not always consistent with the wishes of the subject.  I can see real benefits for X if an order is granted.   I recognise that she is an articulate and able 17 year old with a mind of her own and as her advocate I would wish to ensure that the court is fully conversant with her views. </span></p>

I suspect that X&#8217;s intention to pursue a university education in the United Kingdom will remain, whether or not she is adopted.  I further suspect that AB will continue to provide for her as a child of his family financially, practically and emotionally, as he has done so to date.

However, an order would promote X&#8217;s sense of belonging and ensure that her wishes are recognised.  It would further entitle her to UK citizenship and on the basis of the Home Office having no objection to an adoption order being granted in this case, I can find no coherent reason to make a recommendation to the contrary.  On this basis and following clarification of the issues pertaining to country C citizenship previously identified, I too would support the making of an adoption order in favour of AB.&#8221;</span></p>

It is quite clear that her welfare needs would be met by an adoption order being made. As the President, Sir James Munby, recently remarked in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re X</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> [2014] EWHC 3135, paragraph 54, an adoption order &#8220;has an effect extending far beyond the mere legal.  It has the most profound personal, emotional, psychological, social and, it may be in some cases, cultural and religious consequences.&#8221;   Miss Day, in her report, describes this case as being finely balanced.  The factors that tip her to recommend the order being made, are the benefits of British citizenship and X&#8217;s personal need for a parental figure.  As Miss Cronin described in her submissions, this was graphically illustrated by the occasion at X&#8217;s school when she hoodwinked AB in being able to come into the school thinking it was to see one of the teachers, and it resulted in a surprise birthday celebration in the classroom that X had clearly arranged and clearly wanted to be able to take place in front of her fellow classmates.  Perhaps a small vignette, but it clearly demonstrates her need to be able to have a parental father-figure.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In relation to the Guardian&#8217;s position, some of the matters that features in her analysis as making this a finely balanced decision have, I think with further discussion and submission, perhaps fallen away.  Firstly, the concern she had about the loss of country C citizenship as a result of X acquiring British citizenship on the making of an adoption order, it is clear, having looked at the document (Annex A attached to Miss Day&#8217;s report) that on the face of it she will not lose her country C citizenship as she will not be acquiring British citizenship by naturalisation and so will not expressly be renouncing her citizenship.  It makes quite clear in the final paragraph of Annex A that there is the possibility of a dual nationality that exists.  But even if it does have the consequence of her losing country C citizenship, it is quite clear from the final part of the last paragraph at Annex A that it is very easy to re-acquire country C citizenship; X would need to do would be by taking an oath of allegiance to country C and as a result, she and any children she may have would be deemed citizens of country C.  That concern, rightly raised by Miss Day in her report, seems to be a matter that is not in reality a loss that X will have as a result of the court making an adoption order.  In any event, it also has to be seen in the context of this case where all the evidence points to AB doing all that he can to ensure that X maintains her relationship with her wider birth family, not only her father and his wife and children but also, importantly, her paternal grandparents who still live in country C, and her maternal grandmother who has played such a key role in her upbringing. </span></p>

Therefore it is said, in effect:  is there any need for an adoption order to be made. </span></p>

Anyone will know that beyond the age of 18 any young person benefits enormously from the guidance and support that they will receive from their parents in relation to supporting them in the various decisions and events that will occur in their lives beyond the age of 18.  That wider view is entirely consistent with the lifelong welfare considerations the court should take into account when considering this type of application. </span></p>

That order will not only give her the tangible benefits such as British citizenship, but also, equally importantly, in my judgment, secure in a life-long way her position with AB.  That can only be to her benefit.  The legal relationship she will lose by this order being made in terms of the paternal family have to be seen in the context of this case where I have already indicated AB has done all that he can to encourage the relationships being maintained, and there is nothing to suggest  that will change in the future.  </span></p>
