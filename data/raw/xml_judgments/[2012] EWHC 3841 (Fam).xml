Both are Hindu.&#160; Both live in India, as does D.&#160; The families of both parties live in India.&#160; The Indian divorce petition was by far and away the first in time, although I accept Ms Chokowry's submission that the weight to be attached to that factor is not so great as it might have been, given the surreptitious way the husband went about it.&#160; There are, the husband says, proceedings in India for Guardianship and contact relating to D.&#160; The parties have no assets in this country, or elsewhere.&#160; They have no continuing connection with this country, except to the extent that as from January 2012 the husband has indefinite leave to remain here.&#160; The wife does not allege that the husband has undisclosed assets.&#160; So the only 'asset' is the husband's earning capacity which (although he is not apparently using it at present) is in India.&#160; </span></p>
