The parents are Ukrainian nationals.  The children currently live with their mother in the south of England.  They have been in this country (travelling here in circumstances which I shall describe at &#167;6 below) since April 2022.  Their father is currently in Kyiv, Ukraine.  The parties are now divorced.   The mother has a partner in England with whom she has been in a relationship for about 18 months; he is English. </span></p>

The first was brought by the father in September 2022 under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref>, incorporating the 1980 Hague Convention; in those proceedings he sought the summary return of the children to Ukraine.  However, when the situation of conflict in Kyiv deteriorated further in early 2023 he applied to withdraw that application; Mr Dexter Dias KC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge of the Family Division, gave him permission to do so.  Mr Dias&#8217; judgment, setting out his reasons, is reported at </span><a class="Hyperlink" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2023/602.html" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Z and X, Re (Children: Article 13(b): Return to Kyiv) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2023/602" uk:canonical="[2023] EWHC 602 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EWHC 602 (Fam)</ref> (17 March 2023) (bailii.org)</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.

I have been provided with publicly available material relevant to the risks which are said to exist in Ukraine at present; on analysis of that material some of it was in fact somewhat out of date, and some of it lacked a degree of objectivity and/or relevance for the task with which I am charged.  I found most useful, in the end, the FCDO current advice in relation to travel to Ukraine which I summarise at </span>&#167;26<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> below.</span></p>

When the war in that country began on 24 February 2022, the father hurriedly assisted the mother to move with the children to safety, from Kyiv to the furthest western reaches of the country; he himself returned to Kyiv as he was obliged to do.  Given that martial law had been imposed, he was not able to leave Ukraine.</span></p>

As I have earlier referenced (</span>&#167;<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">3 above), he ultimately withdrew that application in March 2023, and the final order which confirms this included the following recital:</span></p>

He asserts that he has always provided for the family and was, during their earlier childhoods, the &#8220;sole breadwinner&#8221; of the family. Additionally, he describes how he took the children to school and sports classes and helped them with their homework. As a family, he says, they often went cycling, and went on holiday to the Carpathians and to the Black Sea coast.  He says that the family have been to Transcarpathia four times, most recently in May 2021, with family friends who know the owner of the hotel where they stayed; the children know the area.</span></p>

His proposal is that the children should fly to a city in one of the neighbouring countries (Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, Poland), and then make the final approach to the border by road.  Once across the border he would meet them in order to spend time with them.</span></p>

He told me that he pursues this current application because he desperately wishes to see the children; he spoke of his plans to take them fishing, walking and swimming.  He described Transcarpathia as &#8220;safe&#8221;; he drew attention to the fact that there have been no reported missile attacks in the region for many months; there are no martial hours or laws in place there, and he says that the businesses are running normally.  He told me that he plans to stay with the children in a hotel or sanatorium in Transcarpathia.   He confirmed that he had no intention of taking the children to Kyiv, certainly not without the written agreement of the mother, and was adamant that he would not put them into danger.  He disputed that there are any significant problems or delay in crossing the borders from Slovakia, Hungary, Poland or Romania into Ukraine.</span></p>

The father&#8217;s evidence was that his sister would be able to assist only &#8216;out of season&#8217; (as she works in a hotel) which, it was accepted, would not be practical with the children&#8217;s schooling commitments in the UK.  This proposal had not been foreshadowed in any of the documents, nor in the cross-examination of the Cafcass officer (notwithstanding that I specifically asked whether anyone else had been suggested for this chaperone role).  The father also told me that his older daughter had travelled from Vienna to Lviv (Ukraine) in August 2023 without complications, but this evidence was not investigated further.</span></p>

Ms Baker told me that she believed that the mother was at present reluctant to support the visit for a number of reasons, and was bound to have discussed the issues with the children, but this was not the same as the mother setting out to influence them.

In my judgment, this is not a significant risk, as I do not believe that the father would be likely to take any step which would expose his children to the real risk of harm from military engagement in and around that city.  That said, I was surprised that the father did not rule out altogether a visit to Kyiv with the children, but he was keen to emphasise that he would not take the children back to their old home without express written permission of the mother.  He denied that he had any intention to retain the children in Ukraine if they visited him there.</span></p>

It is on any view no less than about 10 hours; if I were to accept the mothers evidence the journey time could be many times that length.  The mother gave persuasive evidence about the problems at the borders, recounting anecdotes of those she knows who have undertaken the journey, for whom it has taken 27 hours or so simply to pass through the checkpoints/security.  Whatever the length of the security checks, she suspects (with good reason it seems to me) that border crossings would take longer in holiday periods when the father proposes that the children visit.  The mother had done her research in relation to journey time, investigating the flights from the UK (and the specific airports), the need to catch a train or bus, and having regard to their limited frequency, needing a night in a hotel in a foreign city before embarking on the final leg.  She talked me through a suggested itinerary which could take them up to 48 hours to complete, having regard to flights and other transport connections.</span></p>

I have very considerable sympathy for both of these parents.  I cannot begin to imagine the trauma which the war has inflicted on them as individuals, on their close family, on their friends, on their wider families, on their citizens and on their country.  I acknowledge the sadness and the frustration of the father, who earnestly wishes to see his children again, to hold them and &#8211; as he told me &#8211; to hug them.  While video contact offers valuable opportunities for these children and this parent to see and hear each other in real time, 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, I do not doubt the obvious limitations of this medium.  It is an extremely poor substitute for actual, human, physical contact.</span></p>

I have guarded myself against according excessive weight to what may be short-term or transient problems created by the current (albeit enduring) conflict.
