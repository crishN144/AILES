	  <num>1.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application for ancillary relief under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> (the MCA), and a &#8220;big money case&#8221;,  relating to (a) substantial wealth built up during the course of a long marriage as a result of the earnings of the husband as a banker and the chosen lifestyle of the parties, and (b) the husband&#8217;s future earnings.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_2">
	  <num>2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties have four children.  Their choice as a married couple was that the husband focused on his career and the wife travelled with him as his work dictated and devoted herself to supporting him, their home and bringing up their four children.  Their chosen lifestyle during the marriage was therefore one in which the husband and wife by a combination of amongst other things their respective talents, their respective choices, their hard work, their support for each other and good fortune created a family that comprised themselves and four healthy and talented children, which enjoyed an increasingly good standard of living and, certainly during the later years, substantial wealth. </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is not a case in which the wife gave up a career that was likely to provide substantial income or monetary reward.  She was a teacher. No doubt if she had pursued that career it would have provided other and additional benefits and burdens to those she took on as a wife and mother, but it was common ground that the choices made by both the husband and the wife were ones they both made willingly.  Until the onset of the breakdown of their marriage those choices were ones that led to a successful emotional and economic result.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In determining what is a fair distribution of financial resources following the breakdown of a marriage there is to be no gender discrimination.  The chosen roles of the parties to a marriage inevitably give rise to both benefits and burdens.  I remind myself of these points at this early stage of this judgment because, perhaps understandably, both sides in submission tended to stress the burdens of their respective roles and choices rather than the benefits they enjoyed as a result of them.  The reality is that both of their roles have benefits and burdens and they both provide direct and indirect support to the other which enhance aspects of the family life that they both enjoyed.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Some of the benefits of the husband&#8217;s individual role can be easily measured in money terms.  Some, however, such as job satisfaction cannot.  His burdens include long hours, travel and hard work.   The wife&#8217;s role as the home maker and the primary caretaker of the children enabled the husband to devote time to his work which gave them both considerable economic benefits.  Other benefits of her role are intangible.  The bringing up of four children and the creation of a lovely home as the wife has done involves much hard work, love, time and devotion but it results in numerous joys and much satisfaction and pleasure.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case it is clear that neither party regretted the role that they respectively played.  On the contrary during the successful years of the marriage it seems to me that they were both justifiably content with the roles they had chosen.  As Baroness Hale points out in paragraph 154 of her speech in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Miller v Miller; McFarlane v McFarlane</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 AC 618" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 AC 618</ref> (<span style="font-style:italic">Miller &amp; McFarlane</span>) the fact that they both might have wanted to take the roles they did is neither her nor there.  That is generally the fact, and it is the results of the choices and life style of the marital partnership that matter in determining how its fruits are to be shared in a non-discriminatory way.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fallout of the termination of a married lifestyle such as that chosen and enjoyed by these parties is likely to be what has happened in this case, namely that (a) the husband continues working and earning a very high remuneration, and (b) the wife continues to act as the primary caretaker of the children living with them at the matrimonial home.  Save for the financial provision that is made by the husband they both do this without the continued day to day emotional and practical support of the other and the continued emotional pleasure and stability of a home for them both with the children.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">They both therefore in large measure continue to perform, in different households, their respective roles as they have been developed during the marriage.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To my mind given the successes of this marriage and the amount of money available to the parties it is a great pity that, with the benefit of unemotional advice, they have been unable to reach agreement as to what would be fair and have become embroiled in arguments described in submission as &#8220;hot topics&#8221;, in big money cases, concerning the effect and application of the guidance given by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller &amp; McFarlane</span>.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The two central points raised in argument both relate to the husband&#8217;s earnings and effectively to his bonuses.  They were:</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was correctly common ground that the relevance of the first question relates to the application of the yardstick of equality.  In argument what was focused on was where the line should be drawn to identify the assets to which in this case that yardstick applies with such force that, as was common ground, it effectively dictates an equal division of the value of those assets.  The second question is directed to earnings falling on the other side of the line that is drawn.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is also a dispute as to the amount of the periodical payments that the husband should make for the children.  It is common ground that the court has jurisdiction to make such orders because the husband is habitually resident abroad.  I shall deal with this separately at the end of this judgment.</p>

Moreover, I entirely agree with Coleridge J when he points out that during the period of separation the domestic party carries on making her non-financial contribution but cannot attribute a value thereto which justifies adjustment in her favour. Although there is an element of arbitrariness here I myself would not allow a post-separation bonus to be classed as non-matrimonial unless it related to a period which commenced at least 12 months after the separation.&#8221;</p>

Neither case involved an issue relating to bonuses for continuing employment so both the comment relating to bonus and the approval of it are obiter. I do not agree with the approach set out in the last sentence of paragraph 24.4.  It seems to me that the nature of the underlying problem and the relevance of the identification of the matrimonial property (i.e. the application of the yardstick) point strongly to a conclusion that an approach that is acknowledged to be arbitrary, and which therefore does not have regard to the realities and circumstances of a given case, is not correct.

The arguments here, and common sense, show that it is often going to be the case that this date cannot be identified with any certainty because it will not be uncommon that there will be a period during which attempts at reconciliation are attempted.  Such an arbitrary rule also plainly gives rise to the potential for arguments by reference to, for example, company years or accounting periods in respect of which bonus (or other income) is calculated and the possibility of a whole year&#8217;s bonus being excluded or included if for example parties separated on 30 December, or on 2 January.  Such arguments could be met by arguments on apportionment and it may well be that whenever the cut off occurs apportionment would be necessary.  But in my view the need to introduce such arguments is an indication that it is wrong to introduce an arbitrary approach to determine the divide between assets to which the yardstick applies so as to effectively demand an equal division of them and those to which the yardstick applies, or may apply, differently.</p>

The decision of the House of Lords was that the wife should receive periodical payments the amount of which was not limited to her needs until such time as, on an application by the husband (or the wife), it was shown that the periodical payments order should be discharged and a deferred clean break achieved with the payment of a lump sum pursuant to s. 31(7A) of the MCA.</p>

This is good practical sense. Periodical payments are a continuing source of stress for both parties. They are also insecure. With the best will in the world, the paying party may fall on hard times and be unable to keep them up. Nor is the best will in the world always evident between formerly married people. It is also the logical consequence of the retreat from the principle of the life-long obligation. Independent finances and self-sufficiency are the aims. Nevertheless, section 25A does not tell us what the outcome of the exercise required by section 25 should be. It is mainly directed at how that outcome should be put into effect.&#8221;</p>

Although it is not relevant to this case I pause to make the general comment in respect of this passage that future uncertainties, and thus the possibility of a paying party falling on hard times, can render the burden on the paying party of meeting interest payments unfair at the outset and thus a clean break unfair.  If a clean break is ordered and the paying party falls on hard times it is only that party (and perhaps his or her new family) who suffer and that suffering can, for example, lead to bankruptcy. I therefore offer the thought that a clean break based on a borrowing that imposes a heavy, lengthy and unalterable burden on the paying party could be unfair and could be said to discriminate against the paying party. </p>

This is aimed at redressing any significant prospective economic disparity between the parties arising from the way they conducted their marriage. For instance, the parties may have arranged their affairs in a way which has greatly advantaged the husband in terms of his earning capacity but left the wife severely handicapped so far as her own earning capacity is concerned. Then the wife suffers a double loss: a diminution in her earning capacity and the loss of a share in her husband's enhanced income. This is often the case. Although less marked than in the past, women may still suffer a disproportionate financial loss on the breakdown of a marriage because of their traditional role as home-maker and child-carer.</p>

Marriage, it is often said, is a partnership of equals. In 1992 Lord Keith of Kinkel approved Lord Emslie's observation that 'husband and wife are now for all practical purposes equal partners in marriage': <span style="font-style:italic">R v R</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] 1 AC 599" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] 1 AC 599</ref>, 617. This is now recognised widely, if not universally. The parties commit themselves to sharing their lives. They live and work together. When their partnership ends each is entitled to an equal share of the assets of the partnership, unless there is a good reason to the contrary. Fairness requires no less. But I emphasise the qualifying phrase: 'unless there is good reason to the contrary'. The yardstick of equality is to be applied as an aid, not a rule.&#8221;, and</p>

The best example is a wife, like Mrs McFarlane, who has given up what would very probably have been a lucrative and successful career. If the other party, who has been the beneficiary of the choices made during the marriage, is a high earner with a substantial surplus over what is required to meet both parties' needs, then a premium above needs can reflect that relationship-generated disadvantage. </p>

In particular, it may have to give way to the needs of one party or the children. Too strict an adherence to equal sharing and the clean break can lead to a rapid decrease in the primary carer's standard of living and a rapid increase in the breadwinner's. The breadwinner's unimpaired and unimpeded earning capacity is a powerful resource which can frequently repair any loss of capital after an unequal distribution: see, eg, the observations of Munby J in <span style="font-style:italic">B vB (Mesher Order)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2002/3106" uk:canonical="[2002] EWHC 3106 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWHC 3106 (Fam)</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 FLR 285" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 FLR 285</ref>.

I agree that there cannot be a hard and fast rule about whether one starts with equal sharing and departs if need or compensation supply a reason to do so, or whether one starts with need and compensation and shares the balance. Much will depend upon how far future income is to be shared as well as current assets. In general, it can be assumed that the marital partnership does not stay alive for the purpose of sharing future resources unless this is justified by need or compensation. The ultimate objective is to give each party an equal start on the road to independent living. --------------------</p>

Is the 'matrimonial property' to consist of everything acquired during the marriage (which should probably include periods of pre-marital cohabitation and engagement) or might a distinction be drawn between 'family' and other assets? Family assets were described by Lord Denning in the landmark case of <span style="font-style:italic">Wachtel v Wachtel</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1973] Fam 72" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1973">[1973] Fam 72</ref>, at 90: </p>

To this list should clearly be added family businesses or joint ventures in which they both work. It is easy to see such assets as the fruits of the marital partnership. It is also easy to see each party's efforts as making a real contribution to the acquisition of such assets. Hence it is not at all surprising that Mr and Mrs McFarlane agreed upon the division of their capital assets, which were mostly of this nature, without prejudice to how Mrs McFarlane's future income provision would be quantified. ----------------- </p>

If capital has been equally shared and is enough to provide for need and compensate for disadvantage, then there should be no continuing financial provision. In <span style="font-style:italic">McFarlane</span>, there has been an equal division of property, but this largely consisted of homes which can be characterised as family assets. This was not enough to provide for needs or compensate for disadvantage. The main family asset is the husband's very substantial earning power, generated over a lengthy marriage in which the couple deliberately chose that the wife should devote herself to home and family and the husband to work and career. The wife is undoubtedly entitled to generous income provision for herself and for the sake of their children, including sums which will enable her to provide for her own old age and insure the husband's life. She is also entitled to a share in the very large surplus, on the principles both of sharing the fruits of the matrimonial partnership and of compensation for the comparable position which she might have been in had she not compromised her own career for the sake of them all. The fact that she might have wanted to do this is neither here nor there. Most breadwinners want to go on breadwinning. The fact that they enjoy their work does not disentitle them to a proper share in the fruits of their labours. &#8221;</p>

That product is, or may only be, realisable in the future, but in one sense it is not a future resource because it has been created during the partnership.  It is something intangible that will continue over a period of time to produce an enhanced income for the husband, so long as he continues to be employed in equivalent work.  It therefore fits within the heading &#8220;compensation&#8221; together with other elements of the concept.  If, as might be the case, with a royalty or the profits (after deduction of remuneration) of a company a capital value can be placed on such an asset I accept that the wife&#8217;s entitlement and award by reference to it might be classified as one based on sharing rather than compensation.  Normally such a capital value would be based on a multiple of earnings or profits and is time limited in this way. </p>

Indeed Lord Nicholls recognises the overlap between financial needs and compensation in paragraph 15, and his description of sharing in paragraph 16 is wide enough to cover an award in respect of an enhanced income or earning capacity and thus economic disparity flowing from it.  Also he points out that double counting should be avoided, as does Baroness Hale in paragraph 137 where she also indicates that any or all of the elements of the rationale might provide the basis for an award.</p>

No doubt both parties had high hopes for their future when they married. But hopes and expectations, as such, are not an appropriate basis on which to assess financial needs. Claims for expectation losses do not fit altogether comfortably with the notion that each party is free to end the marriage. Indeed, to make an award by reference to the parties' future expectations would come close to restoring the 'tailpiece' which was originally part of section 25. By that tailpiece the court was required to place the parties, so far as practical and, having regard to their conduct, just to do so, in the same financial position as they would have been had the marriage not broken down. It would be a mistake indirectly to re-introduce the effect of that discredited provision. &#8221;</p>

I accept the husband&#8217;s evidence that he became depressed and that the turning point from this was around August 2005.  I do not mention this to indicate, or infer, that the wife suffered less.  I mention it to confirm that far from lending support to their respective roles relating to the marriage, at work and at home, the relationship between husband and wife from January 2005 was causing emotional problems and distress to them both and was not promoting or assisting their performance of their respective roles.  The fact that they both succeeded in performing their roles (one at work and one at home) is to their credit; but they achieved this without a continuation of the mutual support that had existed during the happy years of the marriage.</p>

It is of course speculation whether the husband would have been so successful if the wife had not given his career her full support by, for example, going to Japan, or by not giving up her work and career as a teacher.  However a &#8220;but for test&#8221; indicates that the wife did not make it possible for the husband to concentrate on his career (save possibly in the early years by her agreement to go to Japan) and the enhancement of his earning capacity and income by her domestic contribution must be small in economic terms.  In my view the reality is that his high level of income is primarily based on his talents, hard work and good fortune in pursuing his career.  </p>

But in my view if the husband had advanced arguments that the wife should receive no more than a half share of those assets those arguments would have failed even though it could have been said with force, and I accept and assume, that an award of half of the matrimonial property as at 1 January 2005 (a) would enable the wife to live the rest of her life in great comfort, without any financial worries and to build up substantial savings, and (b) would meet the rationale for an award based on the factors set out in paragraph 107 above (i.e. the wife&#8217;s needs, and the rationales of contribution and sharing (as defined therein)).  Such arguments would have failed because, in my view, the principles of fairness, equality and non-discrimination require that the wife receives an additional award to reflect her contribution over the years of the marital partnership that has resulted in the husband&#8217;s enhanced or greater earning capacity (and is a fruit or product of the marital partnership).  </p>

But that disparity will occur in circumstances when the marital  partnership and the marriage is over and the relationship between the parties and between them and their children has changed from one based on one household to one based on two households.  It will thus relate to a period during which the mutual co-operation at the heart of the marital partnership, which founds the wife&#8217;s entitlement to one half of the matrimonial property as at 1 January 2005, is over. </p>

Without a cross-check against the figures in my view a &#8220;run off&#8221; award for this purpose of a sum equivalent to the total of one third of the income earned in 2005, one sixth of the income earned in 2006 and one twelfth of the income earned in 2007 would be fair.  </p>

The 2006 and 2007 bonuses are of similar amounts, and whether the prediction in evidence that the 2008 bonus is likely to be equivalent turns out to be correct or not, in my view, it is sensible and fair to take those years to cross-check.  Taking the figures in paragraph 20, the range of such an award would be between in round figures &#163;1.37 million and &#163;1.39 million.

In my view correctly neither side argued that there should be any adjustments to take account of, for example, changes in value of the assets as at 1 January 2005 or the interim financial support provided by the husband since January 2005.  In my view, and although parts of my reasoning (a) relate to assets as at 1 January 2005 and to bonuses already paid and deferred elements of bonus, and (b) do not precisely follow the reasoning of either side, I too consider that it would not be appropriate to make any adjustment for interim financial support and that the approach based on current share prices covers changes (increases/decreases) in the values of the assets as at 1 January 2005 and the elements of the bonuses that have been received and which are deferred. </p>
