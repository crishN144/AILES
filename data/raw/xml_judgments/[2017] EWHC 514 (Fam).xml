I note that this contact was arranged by Irish Social Services.  We do not have any evidence from them, so I am unable to say whether or not she told Irish Social Services about the threats to kill.  But in the absence of evidence that she did then I have to proceed on the basis that she did not.  </span></p>

We now know that, at that time, M F was living in Boston.  Therefore, the five hours&#8217; time difference between the time when the father sent them from his phone and the time when M F is received them on hers is explained - five hours being the time difference at that time year between Boston and Ireland.  </span></p>

The critical question is what will happen if, with the mother, the child is returned.  If the court concludes that, on return, the mother will suffer such anxieties that their effect on her mental health will create a situation that is intolerable for the child, then the child should not be returned.  It matters not whether the mother's anxieties will be reasonable or unreasonable.  The extent to which there will, objectively, be good cause for the mother to be anxious on return will nevertheless be relevant to the court's assessment of the mother's mental state if the child is returned.&#8221;</span></p>

That is why - she says - she had to get away and that is why - she says - she had to do so secretly.  She was too afraid to do otherwise and she is too afraid to go back.  Critics of the Convention have claimed that the courts are too ready to ignore these claims, too reluctant to acknowledge the harm done to children by witnessing violence between their parents, and too willing to accept that the victim, if she is a victim, will be adequately protected in the courts of the requesting country&#8230;In particular, it is said, the courts in common law countries are too ready to accept undertakings given to them by the left-behind parent; yet these undertakings are not enforceable in the courts of the requesting country and indeed the whole concept of undertakings is not generally understood outside the common law world.  At all events, the change in the likely identity of the abductor places a premium on the efficacy of protective measures which was not so apparent when the Convention was signed.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Yet the parties also understand that there is no easy solution to such problems.  The first object of the Convention is to deter either parent (or indeed anyone else) from taking the law into their own hands and pre-empting the result of any dispute between them about the future upbringing of their children.  If an abduction does take place, the next object is to restore the children as soon as possible to their home country, so that any dispute can be determined there.  The left-behind parent should not be put to the trouble and expense of coming to the requested state in order for factual disputes to be resolved there.  The abducting parent should not gain an unfair advantage by having that dispute determined in the place to which she has come.  And there almost always is a factual dispute, if not about the primary care of the children, then certainly about where they should live, and in cases where domestic abuse is alleged, about whether those allegations are well-founded.  Factual disputes of this nature are likely to be better able to be resolved in the country where the family had its home.  Hence it is one thing to say that the factual context has changed and another thing entirely to say that the change should result in any change to the interpretation and application of the Hague Convention.&#8221;</span></p>
