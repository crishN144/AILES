It provided, in essence, that the wife should receive the former matrimonial home in England and a lump sum of &#163;4 million.  The wife later discovered that the husband had failed to disclose two valuable trusts of which the husband was the principal beneficiary.  That led to her successful application in 2015 to set aside the consent order which had been made in June 2010.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.91in;margin-right:0.01in">In his judgment after the re-hearing in 2016 Moylan J decided to adopt what he called the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Kingdon</span> approach&#8221;.  That was based upon the observations of, and approach adopted by, Wilson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Kingdon v Kingdon</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2010/1251" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCA Civ 1251" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWCA Civ 1251</ref>.  The propriety of the <span style="font-style:italic">Kingdon </span>approach in<span style="font-style:italic"/>appropriate circumstances had clearly been recently approbated by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Sharland v Sharland</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2015/60" uk:canonical="[2015] UKSC 60" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] UKSC 60</ref>, at paragraph 43.  The essence of it is that where there has been non-disclosure of a discrete asset such as some shares, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Kingdon</span>, or an interest in trusts, as in this case, the court may (it is a matter of discretion with, the Supreme Court said, &#8220;enormous flexibility&#8221;) decide to isolate those undisclosed assets and decide how to apportion them between the parties, leaving the remainder of the original order in relation to the disclosed assets unaltered. </p>

Finally, Moylan J uplifted the final order to &#163;6.42 million to reflect the delay in the wife receiving this part of her entitlement (paragraph 106 of the judgment), and the fact that the original lump sum had been, in part, payable by instalments, which would not have been agreed if the wife had known of the existence of the trusts funds (paragraph 107 of the judgment). </p>

For reasons of commercial confidentiality, and consistent with orders made by myself on 17 July 2018, I will refer to those companies collectively as &#8220;CBA&#8221;.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">At all material times up to, and for a period after, the judgment and order of Moylan J, the husband owned 81.82 per cent of the issued shares in CBA.  The Goddard-Watts 1999 Settlement owned the remaining 18.18 per cent.  The wife is a trustee of the 1999 Settlement and knew the structure of the shareholdings in CBA.  The 1999 Settlement is <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> one of the trusts which the husband had previously failed to disclose.  CBA was, and is, a successful trading company which sells, wholesale, a range of branded products, and the husband&#8217;s shares in CBA were, and are, a significant financial asset or resource.  So there was considerable focus on the value of those shares during the five-day hearing before Moylan J in late June 2016.   </p>

FED is a significantly larger company than CBA.  FED sells, retail, in various parts of the world, products which include products of the same type as those sold by CBA.  So FED was not, and is not, simply an investor such as a private wealth fund.  FED was, and is, potentially a special purchaser who trade in the same field and same products as CBA, and who considered that there was, to use the word much used in the documents in this case, a natural &#8220;synergy&#8221; between the two companies.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">In September 2015 FED made a conditional offer to purchase the whole of the shares in CBA (both those owned by the husband and those owned by the 1999 Settlement) for &#163;82.6 million net of debt.  That offer did not fructify and was not still on the table by the time of the hearing before Moylan J in late June 2016.  If a sale had taken place at that price, the husband would have received somewhere in the region of &#163;65 million net of transaction costs for his shares.  As the husband was, and is, resident in Switzerland, any liability to taxation would have been low. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">As the sale in 2015 had not fructified, the husband&#8217;s shares were the subject of a valuation by an accountant, Mr David Greene, of MGR Weston Kay LLP, instructed as a single joint expert.  Mr Greene valued the husband&#8217;s shares in the two companies which comprise CBA in aggregate at &#163;16.14 million, or about one-quarter of the amount the husband would have received if the sale to FED had gone through.  Inevitably, both Mr Greene and the husband himself were very strongly pressed and cross-examined by Mr Martin Pointer QC, who then acted on behalf of the wife, as to the true value of the shares in the light of the negotiations which had taken place with FED and their recent conditional offer.  The husband unquestionably knew perfectly well that the wife and her legal advisors were very interested in the true value of the shares, and very interested in what had passed between CBA and FED.  All of this was summarised and the subject of adjudication by Moylan J at paragraphs 61 to 64 of his judgment handed down on 23 November 2016 as follows: </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.49in;margin-right:0.51in">One of the issues which Mr Greene considered in his report and which was further explored during the course of the hearing, was the relevance to the current value of [CBA] of an indicative conditional offer (&#163;82.6 million net of debt) made by a major public company [<span style="font-style:italic">viz</span> FED] in September 2015.  This offer was preceded by an Information Memorandum dated August 2015.  It was withdrawn, without explanation, in October 2015. </p>

One of these was that the forecast EBITDA and maintainable profit adjustments for 2016 were &#8216;realistic and achievable&#8217;.

The 1999 Settlement received &#163;4.45 million, in each case for the sale of a one-quarter share of their original holdings.  The sale contract provides that FED have an option to buy the residue of the shares for &#163;75 million.  If that option is exercised, the husband would receive a further &#163;61.3 million (less transaction fees and costs), thus receiving, in total, &#163;20.45 million plus &#163;61.3 million, or &#163;81.75 million (less transaction fees and costs) for the shares which Mr Greene, in June 2016, and Moylan J, in November 2016, had valued at about &#163;16.14 million.  I stress very clearly indeed, however, that the present application is <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> based upon a significant change in the value of the assets shortly after the order had been made.

The husband is not contractually obliged to buy them back, but his evidence is that, commercially, it would probably be necessary for the future prosperity of CBA and in his own best interests to do so.  He would have to raise and pay &#163;25 million with no contribution from the 1999 Settlement, but he would then own not only all the shares which he had previously owned, but also those which the settlement had owned and sold, so he would end up with 86.365 per cent of the total shares.  The husband suggests, therefore, that, at the moment, the benefit to him of the deal with FED remains uncertain, and may be illusory.

Much of the work of Grant Thornton had been carried out by a director of that firm, M.  M did not give evidence to Moylan J, but he did to me.  His evidence now is qualified by the fact that he left Grant Thornton in the summer of 2017 and no longer has access to any written records, save such documents as the parties have produced to him.  He was, however, very clear in his oral evidence that the reason why a sale did not eventuate in 2015 was not simply that the offer was heavily caveated and subject to the key assumptions, but also that the husband had set a target of &#163;100 million cash for the whole of the shares (his and those of the 1999 Settlement), and the husband was simply not willing to close a deal with FED at the lesser net price which they were then offering.

I am not willing to accept that particular submission.  Given that the meeting had taken place on Monday, 21 November, and the proposal sent to X on the afternoon of Tuesday, 22 November, it seems to me entirely natural that the husband and his staff should wait until they knew they would be meeting the following day in Jersey before deciding how to move forward in the light of any reply from X.

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">On the basis of that evidence, Moylan J was to conclude, five months later on 23 November 2016, that the withdrawn offer was of no relevance to the valuation exercise because it did not reflect the likely value of the business.  But, in the intervening period since October 2015, there had in fact been a number of contacts between CBA or Grant Thornton and FED as described above, both before and after the hearing before Moylan J in late June.  The possibility of a sale of the whole or a minority interest had clearly been discussed.  The point had been reached when, on 22 November 2016, M, acting on behalf of the husband personally, made a specific and serious proposal to sell shares at a specified price far higher than the Greene valuation, and indeed higher than the price which FED had offered in September 2015.  As X said in his oral evidence, that proposal did not come out of the blue to him.  There had clearly already been a number of discussions, even if at a very generalised and non-specific level.  The immediate reply from X did not reject the proposal or suggest that the price was obviously too high; indeed, at that stage it sought clarification only of the option point.  By the next day, 23 November, the husband was giving instructions to &#8220;go to the next stage&#8221;. </p>

By the close of the actual hearing before me, that was scarcely disputed.  During his sustained closing submissions last Friday, Mr Bishop effectively conceded that the email of 22 November 2016 and its context should have been disclosed, although the husband could immediately have submitted, as he still does strongly submit, that it was not, on analysis, material. </p>

At the original hearing in July 2012, he gave evidence that there was unlikely to be an IPO for several years.  The case was then settled, and a consent order agreed and approved by the court.  It then emerged, before the order had been sealed and perfected, that the evidence of the husband had been untruthful and that active preparations were being made for an IPO.  At a hearing several months later, in April 2013, the judge found the husband to have been dishonest.  However, he decided, after argument, to cause the order which had been earlier agreed and approved by him in July 2012, to be perfected.  The reason was that, by the time the judge was re-considering the matter several months later in April 2013, no IPO had in fact taken place, and the unchallenged evidence of the husband then was that no IPO was by now contemplated.  So it finally emerged, in the view of the judge, that the non-disclosure, although dishonest and highly material at the time, was no longer material.  The Supreme Court nevertheless allowed the appeal and directed that the consent order should not be perfected. </p>

Even although in that case there was no longer any IPO in contemplation by the time of the hearing before the judge in April 2013, nor, as I understand it, at the time of the hearing before the Supreme Court in 2015, the wife was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">entitled</span>&#8221; to &#8220;a full and fair hearing of her claims&#8221; because the earlier consent order had been undermined by the deception. </p>

There is a further distinction between the facts of <span style="font-style:italic">Sharland</span> and the facts of the present case.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Sharland</span>, the evidence of the husband with regard to the IPO was untrue on the day he gave it in the witness box.  The present application is not based on an assertion that the evidence which the husband gave in June was untrue on the day he gave it, but that it had become untrue (or not the whole truth) by the date of the judgment, and the new, true facts had not been disclosed.  However, given the continuing duty of full and frank disclosure, that is a distinction without a difference. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">In my view, the present case is on all fours with the very basis upon which the Supreme Court, drawing on the third reason given by Briggs LJ, decided <span style="font-style:italic">Sharland</span>.  The husband in the present case deliberately, as I have found, withheld and failed to disclose the truth.  Moylan J would not have made the order he did when he did if the truth had been known.  If, on 23 November 2016, the wife and Moylan J had known the true facts, it is inevitable that Moylan J would have withheld handing down his draft judgment.  He would have adjourned the proceedings while the full and true facts were ascertained, and while the wife and her advisors could take stock.  At a further hearing, after, inevitably, further evidence and further submissions, he would have decided what impact the true facts had on the terms he had previously decided to order.  It is enough, per paragraph 15 of <span style="font-style:italic">Sharland</span>, as reflected in paragraph 35, that the non-disclosure has deprived the wife &#8220;of a real prospect of doing better at a full hearing&#8221;. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">The original consent order from 2010 had been set aside by Moor J in 2015.  Moylan J in 2016 was, accordingly, re-exercising the statutory duties under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>, as amended.  It was arguable, to put it no higher, that the property of the husband, consisting of the shares, although valued by Mr Greene at around &#163;16 million, was capable of being sold to the special purchaser for over five times that amount.  Moylan J might, in the end, still have adopted the <span style="font-style:italic">Kingdon</span> approach.  But it is not possible to say that there was not &#8220;a real prospect&#8221; of the wife doing better.  The wife is accordingly entitled to re-open the case and has, so far, been deprived, by the husband&#8217;s deliberate concealment, of a full and fair hearing of her claims when all the relevant facts are known. </p>

But in my view, the burden of satisfying the court of that must lie with the perpetrator of the fraud.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">With respect to the Supreme Court, the first sentence of this particular paragraph is not entirely easy to read, as it melds the separate situations of a consent order and an imposed non-consent order into a single sentence.  In so far as it applies to the present case, which concerns an imposed, non-consent, order, the effect of paragraph 33 is that there is an exception if I am satisfied that, at the time when Moylan J made his order, he <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> not have made a significantly different order if Moylan J had known then what I know now.  If I am so satisfied, then the order of Moylan J should stand.  If I am not so satisfied, it must be set aside and a re-hearing ordered.  The language of paragraph 33 is clearly that I must be satisfied that Moylan J <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> not have made a significantly different order, not that he might not have done.  The burden of so satisfying me must lie upon the husband who deliberately perpetrated the non-disclosure.  But wherever the burden lies, I am far from satisfied that Moylan J<span style="font-style:italic"> would</span> not have made a significantly different order, although I readily accept that he might not have done. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">Mr Bishop and Mr Sear advance a number of reasons why they submit that Moylan J would not have made a significantly different order and, accordingly, that the non-disclosure is not material and/or that the case falls within the exception under paragraph 33.  But those reasons boil down to two.  First, they submit and stress that a unique feature or circumstance of the present case is that it is a second set-aside application, and that, therefore, it is illuminated, if not governed, by the decision and reasoning of Moylan J to adopt the <span style="font-style:italic">Kingdon</span> approach, as recently approbated in <span style="font-style:italic">Sharland</span> at paragraph 43.  The effect of adopting the <span style="font-style:italic">Kingdon</span> approach was ultimately to leave the shares and their value, whatever it was, out of account, and simply fairly to apportion the previously undisclosed trust assets.  The reasoning of Moylan J was that the assets which had been disclosed in 2010, which included the shares, had been divided then in a way which was fair then and which remained fair.  So, Mr Bishop and Mr Sear submit, it ultimately makes no difference whether the 2016 value of those shares was &#163;16 million, or an achievable &#163;85 million, or any other sum.   </p>

It is a certainty that if Moylan J had known, on 23 November 2016, what I know now, he could not and would not have expressed himself, without more, in the way that he did in paragraphs 61 to 64 of his (then, draft) judgment.  Before handing it down, he would have to have re-written or elaborated those paragraphs.  Further, he would inevitably have to have granted an adjournment, heard more evidence and heard more argument. </p>

There is a huge difference between a case in which the total assets of the husband are of the order of &#163;30 million, on the basis of the Greene valuation of his shares in CBA, or almost &#163;100 million, on the basis of the price proposed in the email of 22 November 2016.  In my view, it is simply impossible to be satisfied that Moylan J would still have adopted and quite rigorously applied the <span style="font-style:italic">Kingdon</span> approach, without some other adjustments, if he had known the likely true scale of the case.   </p>

It is now ten years since the parties separated, and she continues to battle for a just resolution of her claims based on openness and full and frank disclosure.  From the perspective of the husband, I do not regret it.  Frankly, he has brought it upon himself by his folly, not once, but twice, of seeking to conceal obviously important facts, despite surrounding himself by legal teams of the utmost distinction.  But, to both parties, I wish to close with the following entirely neutral observations.  They have now been engaged for ten years, on and off, in highly destructive and financially disastrous litigation.  I have no idea what all the earlier litigation up to the conclusion of the hearing before Moylan J cost, but the sums will have been very great.  I do know that just to get from the conclusion of the hearing before Moylan J to the conclusion of the present hearing (i.e. to today) the wife has incurred costs of about &#163;662,000, inclusive of VAT.  The husband has incurred costs of &#163;638,000, exclusive of VAT, to which he, being non-resident, is not liable.  In addition, there is an aggregate liability of about &#163;140,000 to CBA and FED, who became involved at an earlier stage of the present proceedings.  I may shortly have to decide how that is to be borne as between the husband and the wife, but one or other of them will have to pay it.  So their total combined costs exposure, just to get this far, is little short of &#163;1.5 million.  The further combined costs between now and the conclusion of a fully contested, further so-called final hearing could not be less (at current levels of representation and rates of spending) than a further &#163;1 million, making a combined total of &#163;2.5 million since these parties left the court of Moylan J.  These parties are millionaires, but not billionaires, and this is absurdly profligate spending, the more so as, shortly before this hearing, the wife made an open offer that she would accept a further &#163;3 million and no order as to costs, thus leaving a net gain in her hands of well under &#163;2.5 million.   </p>
