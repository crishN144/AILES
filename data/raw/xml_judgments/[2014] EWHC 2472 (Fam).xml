Judges and practitioners are in the process of grappling with Article&#160;15, particularly in relation to public law proceedings.  It is my experience that nonetheless these determinations can be resolved very much more quickly than may appear on paper, even when, as in this case there are many pages of paper; assessments, reports and a large number of court orders.  This hearing has in fact been concluded in under half a day.  </span></p>

He is not entitled to any form of state support here, principally because of his conviction for a driving offence for which he served the term of imprisonment.  He supports a transfer of the case to Romania on the basis not only that this is a Romanian child but because he cannot afford to remain in this jurisdiction for very much longer; he needs to return.  If he does so his public funding may well cease, and it will be difficult for him to litigate here in any event.  He puts forward family members, including his sister, as part of the &#8216;support package&#8217; (to use English jargon) to help him look after A.  He argues that it is for the Romanian authorities to assess the sufficiency of his potential care for A, particularly bearing in mind, as the President stressed in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re E (A Child) </span><span style="font-size:14pt"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/6" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 6 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 6 (Fam)</ref>, that this Court and our institutions must guard against applying our cultural norms, our expectations, or indeed our remedies, in deciding on solutions for a child of a different culture where different norms and expectations may apply.</span></p>

It is self-evident that A has a&#160;particular connection with Romania.  With all parties&#8217; agreement, I have approached the examination of the two contentious elements in Article 15(1), namely, is Romania better placed to hear the case and is this in the best interests of the child; with the assistance of a&#160;&#8220;pros and cons&#8221; list.  Such are used routinely in the Court of Protection as an aid to determining best interests, and were recommended by the Court of Appeal as an aid and a tool for decision-making in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re B-S</span><span style="font-size:14pt">.  As a result of that exercise, the local authority arrived at a position where they put forward only &#8220;pros&#8221; in respect of a transfer and could not identify any &#8220;cons&#8221;.</span></p>

At that stage she supported adoption.  She and Mr. McIlwain recognise that the father&#8217;s engagement in this process and the assessment has changed the landscape.  Although this is by no means determinative &#8211; far from it - the father&#8217;s contact with A is observed to be good. At the moment there is cautious optimism that the father&#8217;s care may in any event, applying purely English considerations, be considered to be appropriate.</span></p>

They have however made it quite clear that, if the Court were to reach the position whereby it was actively considering adoption of this child through the English system, they would be highly likely to request repatriation of their citizen.  As the Guardian, through Mr McIlwain, has of course pointed out to me, pursuant to Article 56 of BIIR the Court can place a child in institutional care or with a foster carer in another member state following consultation with and the consent of the competent authority of the requested state.</span></p>

Adoption is a last resort. As Ryder LJ said in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Nottingham</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, the question of the Court which is best placed to decide the case is intimately connected with the question of best interests. I see no difficulty in conflating those two considerations when considering &#8216;pros&#8217; and &#8216;cons&#8217;.  The father&#8217;s proposal to live in Romania with support from Romanian family members can more easily be assessed &#8211;arguably, can only properly be assessed in this context &#8211; by the Romanian authorities, applying Romanian standards.  The question of whether such support can be underpinned by any form of court order, such as an equivalent to our supervision order, or by any form of state charitable or voluntary sector intervention, can only be answered by the Romanian authorities.  Only they can decide how this fundamentally Romanian child would be served by the placement options, and (a) whether any negatives in the assessment to be carried out on the father (if indeed they do take it into account, which must be a matter for them) would rule the father out in Romanian terms and (b) to assess the efficacy or family or other support in Romanian terms.  Furthermore, the father can best litigate in Romania, and is likely not to be able to do so effectively here.</span></p>

In that case there had been a fact finding hearing and the case was eminently and imminently capable of resolution by the Judge who had found the facts.  Here, the case has profoundly changed as a result of the father&#8217;s now presenting himself for assessment.  Judge Sapnara did not consider the merits in any respect and I am now the second High Court Judge to deal with the matter, the case having not been subject to any judicial continuity at its earlier stages.  Therefore, A&#8217;s future, albeit belatedly, is now being considered in a totally different context from that in which it previously came before the Court.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The assessment will be concluded on 8 August.  If it is negative or ambiguous, the father may wish to challenge it.  The mother may have her own case as to whether she should now put herself forward or propose other family members or make other proposals for the care of A.  Although, as Mr. McIlwain rightly observes, at a hearing after 8 August, which would be likely to be around the time when the response to a request could at the latest be expected if I make that decision now, it would then be possible to fix the case for final hearing.  That could well be a three - to four - day hearing, bearing in mind the need for interpreters.  It is difficult to foresee precisely what the timescale would be for A if the case is retained here.  Practical difficulties might, of course, arise as to translation of and cross examination of the assessment of the fact (assuming it to be less than positive).  Those are difficulties likely to be no more difficult, perhaps in reality much less difficult, than the problems of this local authority carrying out or commissioning inquiries as to the father&#8217;s capacity to care for A in Romania, particularly bearing in mind the cultural considerations and the difficulties in any event for an English Court to assess what really is available for A in Romania.  So those considerations are either neutral or tip over into the &#8220;pros&#8221; column.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The Guardian, whose initial view was that the Court ought to rule against making an Article 15 request, takes the view that the decision now is very finely balanced between making a request now and putting that off until after the father&#8217;s assessment is concluded.  She is concerned that, if the case is transferred to Romania, the prospect of an easy reunification with the father in this jurisdiction within these proceedings may be inhibited if the Romanian court is to be in charge.  In fact, the timing in this case is such that I do not see that as a particularly likely outcome but, in any event, it does not militate against the view that, in principle, Romania is the right jurisdiction.  In any event there are many uncertainties have about timescale and the outcome of the assessment that none of these matters would tip the balance.  </span></p>

The worst prospect for A would be to get to the stage, foreseeable, if not necessarily likely, whereby, if the father fails his assessment, adoption is put forward as the English solution, and the Romanian authorities then make a&#160;request for repatriation.  If there is to be a move for A, it must take place, both in terms of jurisdiction and physically, at the earliest stage. </span></p>

As Mr. Justice Moylan remarked in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Leicester</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> case, the longer a child stays in a particular placement, the more difficult it is to dislodge him.  It is difficult to say whether a move from an established foster placement to another temporary placement now or fairly soon, or to be removed in three to six months time potentially to a permanent placement in three or six months&#8217; time, would be a worse outcome for A.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Those considerations have led to my decision that a request for transfer should be made now.  It seems quite possible, if not likely, that, once a formal request is made, the Romanian authorities will be able to communicate a clear decision, whereas that is more difficult for them on a theoretical basis now.  That seems to be the growing experience of Article 15 decisions.  If Romania does not accept the request, the case will be on track, albeit much delayed, for a resolution of the proceedings here, and possibly, if all goes well, consensually.</span></p>
