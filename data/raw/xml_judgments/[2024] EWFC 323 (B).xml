	      </authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"> I will keep all of this information in mind whether or not I specifically refer to it below. The hearing was conducted on an attended basis save Dr Black gave evidence remotely. The parents were assisted by interpreters. In this judgment I refer to the parents as J (N&#8217;s mother) and M (N&#8217;s father). I intend no discourtesy by doing so. J attended every day of the hearing. M was present to hear the applicant&#8217;s evidence but left on the morning the mother was due to commence her evidence and did not return to the hearing. As such he did not give evidence. His lawyers made efforts to contact him without success and I proceeded in his absence. I was unable to provide a reasoned judgment within the time allotted to the case and adjourned to provide this reserved judgment.</span></p>

It argues (i) N cannot return to either parents&#8217; care at this point  in time, and (ii) there is no foundation for believing either will make the necessary changes to provide good enough care for him within his timescales. The guardian agrees. The parents take differing positions. J accepts N cannot return to her care at this time and accepted the making of a care order, but, argued I should not make a placement order as I should proceed on the basis she should have the chance to engage with necessary work so that N could be returned to her care in due course. She did not support N being alternatively placed with M. Prior to leaving the hearing M had argued for N to be placed into his immediate care and opposed both the making of the orders sought or return of N to J&#8217;s care.</span></p>

I cannot consider the public orders sought by the applicant unless the legal threshold is crossed. For this purpose it is sufficient to have regard to the findings made within the fact finding hearing which establish the crossing of the legal threshold as found in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. Those findings include (1) that N had suffered an inflicted injury at the hands of M which was likely caused by a shaking assault; (2) whilst I did not find J to have failed to protect N I did find she delayed seeking medical intervention when she became aware he was unwell as a result of this assault, and; (3) I made findings relating to emotional harm to N arising from the domestic abuse suffered by J at the hands of M. There is no question the threshold has been crossed and that I </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">can</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'"/><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">make the orders sought.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">The approval of a plan for adoption is the most significant of interferences in family life. Such a plan requires a high level of justification before a Court can approve it. It requires the Court to carefully analyse the realistic options relating to the future care of the child and weigh these in a holistic manner identifying both positives and negatives of each option before selecting the appropriate outcome for N. Whilst there is no presumption in favour of parental care it is important to keep in mind that the Court does not expect perfection in parenting. The question for the Court is as to whether a parent can provide good enough parenting for the child within the child&#8217;s timescales. If a parent can meet this standard then the Court would not be able to support a plan for removal let alone placement. Secondly, the Court has to accept there are a range of acceptable parenting styles and approaches and no fixed norm around which parenting must sit. The nature of the balance that has to be struck is reflected in the principle that adoption should not be endorsed as a plan of action unless there is &#8216;nothing else that will do&#8217; so as to meet the child&#8217;s welfare needs.</span></p>

J disputes such a suggestion and claims that whilst there was ongoing communication between the two of them this reflected their roles as parents to N only and did not suggest a deeper emotional connection. She complains of M stalking her and reports an incident in July 2024 which led to a final termination of any relationship between them. At the date of final hearing both parents were agreeing they were not in communication.

I found it very difficult to reconcile her strong emotions in the light of the findings made by the Court with the manner in which she subsequently agrees to have conducted her relationship with M. There was no need for her to liaise with him as a separated parent given the role of the applicant in arranging contact. Nor do I find it easy to understand why she felt the need to take steps to assist him with respect to employment. Viewed from any angle this gives an impression of a level of mutual obligation that does not fit with her case. A sense of this obligation can be found in her discussions with the experts in the case.</span></p>

Examples are multiple but include the following; (a) Why if M had acted to hack her phone in this way suggested would the subsequent messaging not have been more explicit in detail or content? The assumption is that M hacked J&#8217;s phone to enable him to do her harm by leaving a trail of damaging messages. This being the assumed purpose why did M wholly fail to do so instead composing somewhat mundane conversations and arguments? (b) How likely is it that M would have composed messaging of the form seen in the log? For instance the log proceeds in a conventional way in that a misspelling is followed by short asterisk with the correct word. I consider it most unlikely such a structure would have been used in a contrived conversation. Rather the content of the messaging gives the strong impression of a genuine conversation and indeed has strong similarities with the messaging accepted by J to be genuine (as disclosed by her). Why would M have gone to this length only to broadly replicate a message log already in existence? (iii) Finally, by the end of her examination, J had accepted the genuineness of parts of M&#8217;s message log attributed to her. In doing so a significant hole was blown through her case. Throughout her evidence there had been a lack of clarity as to the basis on which she determined the messaging was faked. At times it seemed as if her rationale simply flowed from the fact that the messages were no longer in existence on her phone. However, once it was established that some of the messaging was genuine then, plainly the same messages would at some point have been found on her own device. Any subsequent reliance on the fact the same was no longer present on her phone failed to provide any basis for questioning the authenticity of the same.</span></p>

The log provided by J as genuine had many characteristics similar to that found in M&#8217;s log. This was not a case in which J&#8217;s log came to be understood in a fundamentally different light when placed next to M&#8217;s log. Rather M&#8217;s log was largely a continuation of the form of conversation found in J&#8217;s log. For my part whilst there were some limited quotes from M&#8217;s log which were put to J as being significant I did not feel this materially moved my understanding of the communications between the parents or what this said about their relationship. Indeed one of the more striking messages was found on J&#8217;s own log in which she appears to have called M and messaged that: &#8216;he had said she could call him at any time&#8217;. This message suggested stronger ongoing attachment between the two. I was not persuaded this had been accidentally sent to M but intended for someone else. I struggle to understand how J could have been confused as to who the conversation was proceeding with given the messages received had the title &#8217;N&#8217;s Dad&#8217; attached to it.</span></p>

There were days in which the logs closely fitted together in such a way as to suggest they were when taken together the full conversation ongoing between the parents. There was no point at which the timing of the messages conflicted so as to suggest all was not as it appeared to be. There was no point at which one log had a content that sat uncomfortably with the content of the other conversation log taken from a similar point in time.</span></p>

Plainly, if this is a genuine message then it fundamentally undermines the case as to relationship put by J. Whilst I am not asked to make a finding as to what happened on this occasion I am satisfied J sent this message. I did not find her evidence as to J having been out of the country in the week or so prior to this to be evidence that undermined the genuine nature of the message. Indeed on my finding it fits well with it. If, as claimed they remained in a relationship then it is not unlikely such a message might have been sent on her return. On balance it is likely the parents retained a relationship in the period post fact finding through to about late July 2024. This unfortunately points to J having a more muddy attitude to the findings made against M within my judgment. It also points to concerns as to transparency in their dealings with the applicant. It is clear on the evidence that these issues would not have been disclosed but for the fallout in the parents relationship on about 20 July 2024.</span></p>

This was a significant invasion of J&#8217;s privacy. It is clear from the picture that M must have held his phone inside the room through an open window when taking the photo. I am in little doubt the case now put by M which is highly critical of J and seeks to suggest she caused the injuries to N flows from his sense of anger, jealousy and betrayal felt by him.</span></p>

In around July 2024 I find it likely J, for reasons unknown, became closer to L and likely associated with this the relationship between J and M ended. The circumstances in which M came to discover this has fostered anger in M towards J and has set the scene for his engagement with the proceedings since that point.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">It is clear M does not accept the findings made against him relating to N&#8217;s injuries. He is of course entitled to hold this view. Separately he has claimed to have developed some insight into the finding of domestic abuse found against him. He accepts he previously viewed domestic abuse as being solely comprised of actual physical violence but now appreciates it is more nuanced and includes a broader range of behaviour patterns. I have reached the conclusion that his progress in such regards remains at a relatively low point. I have reached this conclusion in the light of his behaviour on 21 July 2024 when he attended J&#8217;s property, invaded her privacy, and as I find went on to share the photo with third parties. This behaviour is abusive in character. It bespeaks a form of controlling behaviour and suggests continuing impulsive actions. Separate to this I broadly agree with the Guardian in her characterisation of his changed approach to J following her rejection of him. His statement evidence shows signs of vindictive behaviour on his part. He gives the very strong sense of being out to destroy J&#8217;s case before the Court because he feels hurt by her actions. This is indicative of jealousy and a sense of a wish to achieve retribution against her by hurting her in by impacting on her chance to have N back. This all fits into an abusive framework of behaviour. Finally, in the course of the hearing and just prior to her commencing her evidence M approached J whilst she in the witness box (the Court was not in session). Whilst I do not find he was threatening in his words his actions were such as to undermine her at a very vulnerable point in time. In my assessment M has made little if any progress since the findings were made in recalibrating his behaviour. It is difficult at this point in time to assess when this will change. I find it very difficult to accept the submission that he has either made progress or is ready to commence a process of works to change his attitude or approach. It is difficult to assess how this view might have changed were M to have stayed to give his evidence.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">In the case of J the position is more complex. She has expressed a clear acceptance of the Court&#8217;s findings. However, it is difficult to reconcile this acceptance with my findings as to the continued relationship. It is understood that victims struggle to leave abusive relationships. Such victims are more often than not vulnerable with low levels of self esteem and such individuals can often only find any sense of worth in the relationship they have however damaging it is. In this case it seems clear J maintained an emotional commitment to M and did so beyond the findings of the Court. I appreciate there is evidence of a level of equivocation on her part as to the finding as to the injuries to N, with a return to consideration of epilepsy as a potential cause. It may be that this was the only way in which she could continue to justify her relationship with M. However, whichever way this is approached one is left with some real questions as to the level of insight she has shown in the light of the Court&#8217;s findings. I appreciate her position is now different in that I find an actual separation. But I again remind myself that this is not the first time there has been such a separation and I must be somewhat cautious in my approach to future likelihoods in this regard. In any event her vulnerability and limited individual resilience make her a candidate for future abusive relationships whether or not with M. This is the clear view of the experts in the case.</span></p>

This has contributed to the enmeshed nature of their relationship. My focus within this section relates principally to J although there is no evidence at all of M having a solid support network upon which he can draw. The applicant arranged a support network meeting for J. It is noteworthy that of the three individuals originally identified to attend only one in fact attended. The other two did not and it seems clear J has fallen out with one of the two. On the day three people did attend but of these two were R and L. It troubles the professionals, and the Court, that of the support network two individuals appear to be men with whom J has had some form of relationship. In each case there is a concerning dynamic with respect to M. One might question why they were not original invitees but in any event there is a question as to what support they will in fact be able to provide. The third individual is a female with who J lives. It seems as if this woman, K, is the closest J comes to a friend. But the relationship is relatively recent and J has had experience of such relationships falling away. It seems all of the named individuals lead busy lives and there availability for J is limited. It is a sad feature of this case that J has very poor social resources. She is living in a foreign country and has not yet developed real competency in the language. Those she lives around are part of the same community and there is a certain sense of dislocation and transience in their lives as they work hard to earn enough to pay their rents and live a relatively modest life. It is difficult to identify someone on whom one could place significance reliance.</span></p>

It is very easy to understand why J was unwilling to reveal the same and chose to explain the messages as she did by reference to being hacked. I can appreciate why she may have felt an open approach would have damaged the prospects of having N returned to her care. However, this casts a significant doubt on the prospects of her being open and co-operative with professionals in the future were N returned to her care. In a case with these features any return would have to balance the benefits against the real risk of harm to the child were the circumstances previously existing to return. Transparency would be at a premium yet there is little doubt in my mind that the transparency I have in this judgment comes not through J&#8217;s co-operation but despite her opposition to it. Of course things may change and one hopes that would be the case. The challenge is in reaching such a conclusion when the same has not been readily apparent in the course of very lengthy proceedings and despite the Court reaching very clear and explicit findings.</span></p>

He expressed the view, I am told, that the decision had already been taken and there was no purpose in his remaining. In such circumstances it is difficult to reach any positive conclusion as to likely change. Furthermore, in doing so he removed the ability of others to test his basic case. On the information I have there is little to suggest he has yet made the changes required or that he will likely do so within the timescales required by N. As I have noted above his position as to developing understanding of what comprises domestic abuse is undermined by his lack of insight as to his continuing behaviours. His lack of insight as to the circumstances which led to N&#8217;s injuries undermines any confidence one could have in a safe placement of N within his care.</span></p>

I have to say I struggled with her evidence relating to a specific organisation geared towards providing support for individuals known to derive from her home country. J said she did not engage as they did not have any individuals who spoke her language.

It is to her credit that J went on to speak to her GP about this but there appears an absence of chasing any referral and it was ultimately left to the social worker to engage in the chasing which appears to have led to a referral. The expert evidence suggests that this work will be challenging. J has some deep seated difficulties which derive from her own childhood and upbringing. Unpacking this will be emotionally difficult. She remains vulnerable and the sense of the expert evidence is that she needs to have made progress with her domestic abuse work prior to therapy. But even putting this to one side the timeline for therapy appears to be at no less than 1 year of work rather than a matter of weeks.</span></p>

One can see in the facts of this case the impact on N when this need has not been met. The impact upon him was a serious injury with potentially life long implications. The impact was an emotionally unpredictable home in which his father was abusing alcohol and impulsive behaviour placed him at risk of emotional harm. N&#8217;s welfare requires a predictably available caregiver. A concern in this case has been the absence of such predictable availability when parental difficulties have diverted attention from N&#8217;s needs. N requires a placement with a sense of permanency. A placement which is settled and has solid foundations on which he can thrive and develop. A challenge in this case is the ability of either of his parents to provide N with settled and consistent care when confronted by the other challenges they face. In the case of his father the worry is as to how he navigates N&#8217;s needs whilst being distracted by his relationship demands and personal struggles. In the case of his mother a key issue arises in respect of her ability to prioritise his needs when balanced against her own needs flowing from her own challenging history. A further challenge is her ability to recognise these risks and the absence of real support to help her through difficult periods without which she tends to return to abusive relationships.</span></p>

The danger is that this will leave him emotionally fragile and at risk of significant emotional harm as he seeks to understand why it is he finds himself in such a position. A related likely impact is loss of relationship with his biological family. On the facts of this case this is a reference to a relationship with his parents. Realistically there must be a chance of no direct contact post adoption.

The relationship with M is secondary to that with J but does have value for N. I am less clear as to assessing the prospects of this continuing if N is not placed into M&#8217;s care. It is clear both parents wish to care for N and strongly oppose the plan for adoption. There are reasons for doing so are easy to understand and genuine in nature.

These are well understood and include the stigma of growing up with an institutional parent and in circumstances of regular looked after processes and medicals. Furthermore, even with the most committed foster carers there is a marked distinction as to the level of permanence arising from the same. Such a placement is inherently more precarious given the nature of the relationship between foster carer and the child flows from a contractual relationship between foster carer and applicant. The continuation of such a placement is at the determination of the applicant and there are many factors which can arise which would mean a foster placement could not continue whereas the same issue would not endanger a normal family placement.</span></p>

M was asking for an immediate return of N to his care but had chosen to exempt himself from the hearing prior to giving evidence and was some substantial distance from evidencing changes in his lifestyle that would make such a placement safe and secure. He does not accept the findings of the Court and has shown no level of insight in this regard. It is therefore questionable as to whether he has made the changes necessary to avoid a repeat of the same. J was accepting of a need for a care order whilst she made the necessary changes in her life. She argued it was best for N to wait for her to make these changes so that he could return to her care. She expressed commitment to making these changes and appeared to accept this was work that would require a significant period of time before she would be ready for N to return to her. The applicant and guardian continued to argue for care and placement orders. They argued change was required by both J and M but that there was limited evidential basis for concluding this would be successfully achieved within N&#8217;s timescales, if at all. Short of such change he required permanency in a stable and safe home in which he was central.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">This judgment will now be forwarded to counsel and can be shared with their clients and lay individuals. I would ask for: (i) any corrections; (ii) requests for clarification, and; (iii) suggested modifications to preserve anonymity on likely publication to be provided to me by 10am on 4 November 2024. I intend to hand down this judgment at a 30 minute hearing (remote if agreed) on either of 7-8 November 2024. I will sit at 9.30am if this assists the parties. Can I please have confirmation of the preferred date by 10am as above? It would also assist to have a proposed draft final order by 4pm the day before the handing down. I have agreed to release counsel so long as replacement representation is found.</span></p>
