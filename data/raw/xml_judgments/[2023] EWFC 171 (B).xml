If the issue for the tribunal to decide is whether to believe A or B on the central issue/s, and the evidence is clearly one way then there will be no need to address credibility in general.  However, if the tribunal looks to find support for their view, it must caution itself against treating what it finds to be an established propensity to dishonesty as determinative of guilt for the reasons the Recorder gave in [40].  Conversely, an established propensity to honesty will not always equate with the witness's reliability of recall on a particular issue.  </span></p>

In these circumstances, I venture  to suggest that it would be good practice when the tribunal is invited to proceed on the basis, or itself determines,  that such a direction is called for, to seek Counsel's submissions to identify: (i) the deliberate lie(s) upon which  they seek to rely; (ii) the significant issue to which it/they relate(s), and (iii) on what basis it can be determined  that the only explanation for the lie(s) is guilt. The principles of the direction will remain the same, but they must be tailored to the facts and circumstances of the witness before the court.&#8221;  </span></p>

It often relates to a mother who has covered up for a partner who has physically or sexually abused her child or, one who has failed to get medical help for her child in order to protect a partner, sometimes with tragic results. It is also a finding made in cases where continuing to live with a person (often in a toxic atmosphere, frequently marked with domestic violence) is having a serious and obvious deleterious effect on the children in the household. The harm, emotional rather than physical, can be equally significant and damaging to a child.  </span></p>

A finding of failing to protect can lead a Court to conclude that the children&#8217;s best interests will not be served by remaining with, or returning to, the care of that parent, even though that parent may have been wholly exonerated from having caused any physical injuries.  </span></p>

As Aikens LJ observed in Re J, &#8220;nearly all parents will be imperfect in some way or another&#8221;. Many households operate under considerable stress and men go to prison for serious crimes, including crimes of violence, and are allowed to return home by their long-suffering partners upon their release. That does not mean that for that reason alone, that parent has failed to protect her children in allowing her errant partner home, unless, by reason of one of the facts connected with his offending, or some other relevant behaviour on his part, those children are put at risk of suffering significant harm.&#8221;  </span></p>

Sometimes the linkage will be obvious, as where the facts proved establish physical harm. But the linkage may be very much less obvious where the allegation is only that the child is at risk of suffering emotional harm or, as in the present case, at risk of suffering neglect. In the present case, as we shall see, an important element of the local authority's case was that the father "lacks honesty with professionals", "minimises matters of importance" and "is immature and lacks insight of issues of importance". May be. But how does this feed through into a conclusion that A is at risk of neglect? The conclusion does not follow naturally from the premise. The local authority's evidence and submissions must set out the argument and explain explicitly why it is said that, in the particular case, the conclusion indeed follows from the facts.&#8221;</span></p>

However, he told me that he sleeps in the same bed with his 20 or so year old brother who intentionally pinched/scratched him because Z tried to push him away because it was too hot in bed.

This exercise, other than a direction to identify the terms of a possible Letter of Instruction, was never approved of nor overseen by the court before it was undertaken and the assessment was filed.  No Part 25 application was made by the LA and DD&#8217;s CV was not circulated.  DD was a social worker with child protection experience and less than 10 years post-qualification practice.  She had none of the critically important training and skills to engage with a complex task of assessing risk of sexual harm as opposed to a more straightforward parenting assessment.  She had never before dealt with a case involving alleged sexual abuse and sibling-to-sibling allegations.  The assessment involved direct interviews with the parents and children, including direct work with Y exploring &#8216;the allegation against him&#8217;.  </span></p>

For example: &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Z&#8217;s detailed account of this sexual assault suggests that it is likely that he has experienced significant harm as a result of sexual abuse.&#8221;  </span></p>

This exercise appears to have arisen from a repeated insistence by Y&#8217;s Children's Guardian and the parents that specialist work was required to assist the parents with improving their insight and coping with the impact and implications of A&#8217;s convictions and sexual risk.  This led to a number of directions made at case management hearings in the summer and autumn of 2022, with a specific recommendation from Y&#8217;s Children's Guardian that an organisation known as NCATS be considered and that appropriate work could be done prior to the fact-finding exercise on the basis of A&#8217;s convictions.  What then inexplicably arose instead was this further assessment by a service that normally provided domestic abuse work to families.  NCATS was not adequately considered and the court&#8217;s directions were not followed.  The assessment process was undertaken in November 2022 and the report filed in December without proper consultation with the parties or permission from the court.</span></p>

It yet again led to further interviews with the parents and reports of discussions with them and on which the LA again had sought to rely.  An independent interpreter was not used, but a colleague of BB stepped in to interpret whom it was claimed was an appropriate speaker of the parents&#8217; South Asian language.  Instead of assessing whether this service could meet the needs of the family, BB effectively produced yet another misconceived risk assessment asserting that the parents were unable to protect the children.</span></p>

I note that all the social workers and other professionals involved have almost always used the word &#8216;disclosure&#8217; instead of &#8216;allegation&#8217;, save for the rare exception of a reference to &#8216;allegations&#8217; such as by the social worker AA in certain email correspondence.  I also note that DD considered that her colleagues with which she discussed the case at meetings shared in the belief that Z was the victim of sexual assault by Y, which meetings included AA and team managers.  I also note that CC&#8217;s own record of her and her team manager&#8217;s meeting with the parents on 9.3.22 includes the following words which were used as a means of responding to the parents&#8217; assertions that Z was lying: &#8220;It was explained to the parents that Z provided too many details&#8221;, with the clear implication therefore that he must be telling the truth.</span></p>

This was then perpetuated and repeated through various iterations of social work process in this case, including into these purported &#8216;assessments&#8217;, but will also have lain behind the social workers&#8217; discussions with the parents and indeed the children.  It will have led to a narrowed insight by those professionals into any of the possible contexts for, or interpretations of, or problems with Z&#8217;s allegations, and to a lack of an open-minded approach that could look carefully at all sides of the case and from each child&#8217;s and the parents&#8217; perspectives.</span></p>

However, it is equally important to exclude from consideration that Z may have used or implied these particular words I have pinpointed above, which are nowhere found in his own actual or reported speech.

I invited the parties to draw up an agreed list of issues for the LA to consider and provide a response to as a positive problem-solving exercise, and I attach this list at Appendix A as an illustration of those many concerns.  The LA have quite rightly pointed out that some of these matters cover the work of other agencies and departments, such as V Council, and the training and protocols available to schools, and have properly requested time to provide its response.  </span></p>

Finally, she also concluded that it would be damaging to Y&#8217;s emotional welfare and sibling relationship with Z.  He described being significantly scared at aspects of the court process, and his Children's Guardian felt that the process of giving evidence would recall the clearly frightening experiences he had on being arrested.  Following upon that assessment process, no party then sought that he should give evidence or be subject to cross-examination.  </span></p>

He was noted to be finding it very hard to control himself.  It was decided he would put on &#8216;time out&#8217; from playing a favourite game Kingball for a week and EE told him later that day.  During a conversation with EE towards the end of the school day Z told her about the scratch on his neck.</span></p>

He knew neither of these members of staff very well, but would have been seeing them around the school.  GG noted her discussion with him after she had spoken with the head teacher HH about it and HH made a referral call to the LA with GG sitting with her in her office.  Z and U were then kept late after school in accordance with the advice from the LA, but did not see their parents until after Z was spoken with by the police at school in the early evening.  While waiting for the police to arrive Z spent time with members of staff and U, but I am satisfied that there was no discussion of his comments made to EE or GG until the two police officers arrived at the school at about 5/5.30pm.  The social worker CC had arrived a little while earlier but had no discussion of the allegations with Z.  He was then spoken to in GG&#8217;s office in the presence of CC and the two officers, none of whom he had met before other than GG who also sat in.  Following that discussion Z was transported later that evening to the police station in the police car but without another adult.  CC transported M and U.  He was then interviewed by DC B between 21.28 and 22.25 that night, before returning home.  There was no evidence noted in the police material of any pre-planning or rapport building.</span></p>

Intimate samples were taken and his body examined for marks.  The medical report notes that he declined to permit his genitals to be examined.  No marks, injuries or dilatation was seen at his anus. A vertical hyperpigmented 2cm x 1cm scar was seen on his right neck and upper chest.  Areas of &#8216;patchy itchy dry skin&#8217; were also noted on the backs of his arms as &#8216;?mild to moderate eczema&#8217;.  A note also appears that is said to relate to the mark on his neck &#8220;Mother says from feeling itchy.  Z says so also.&#8221;  I note that this mark is not described as showing patchy dry eczema presentation.  A further note reads: &#8220;He is always scratching himself.&#8221;  I am unaware of any information that suggests an interpreter was present at this examination.</span></p>

When challenged about bad behaviour to his peers on 10.3.22 and whether he wanted to be kind to his friends, he is reported to have replied &#8220;No because they took me to the police station and told me bad things.&#8221;  On 11.3.22 he told EE that he was sad and missing his brother, and said that the police were evil and had taken Y from the place of worship.  He also referred to his M having a &#8216;disagreement&#8217; with his older brother which EE took to mean a fight.  (EE was not clear in her CPOMS note about which older brother was being referred to, but this appears to fit with M&#8217;s account of the recent phone conversation with A in which he was challenging her with many questions.)</span></p>

He has not posed management difficulties to his foster carers and generally interacts well with U.  There have been a very few occasions involving reprimands for inappropriate behaviour.  Z has touched the foster carer&#8217;s cat&#8217;s anus but could not explain why.  On one occasion Z and U were bumping their behinds together and stopped when requested.  On another occasion Z told U off for being &#8216;disgusting&#8217; when U was pulling his trousers down to show his underpants. There is no evidence that this was more than high spirits.  The LA has included in its submissions that this is evidence of &#8216;perceived sexualised behaviour&#8217; between the siblings.  Looking at the Brook Traffic Light Tool for Sexual Behaviours, I fail to see how these could be described as &#8216;sexualised&#8217;.  There has been very little conflict between them save for the occasional normal sibling friction and U occasionally hitting out.</span></p>

M refers to it as an example of Z putting the blame onto one of his siblings, however it strikes me that both boys were annoyed with each other.</span></p>

The Children's Guardian considered that re-watching his ABE video interview and being questioned would be likely to cause emotional harm and be traumatic for Z.  The recommended viewing of the video interview would limit the forensic advantage of cross-examination.  There was an additional risk of Z having to be questioned again within any criminal proceedings.

He sat facing the wall in class. He said that Y had died. He wanted to spend time with Z and regular time to do so was arranged. On 15.3.22 he was noted to be distressed and reporting &#8216;My mummy keeps crying. She wants Y back.&#8217;  In July 2022 he is noted in his education review to be struggling to regulate his emotions and presenting as a very angry little boy who was hurting children quite frequently, just walking past and hitting them.  Z is noted to be very worried about U&#8217;s anger at school.</span></p>

The only flaw in her observations was that she was unaware of any expressive or language difficulties he may have had.  She had not seen the SALT report from M Primary School and considered that he spoke English confidently.  I note that English is not her first language either which may have contributed to this perception, and as noted previously that his friendly nature and use of distraction may have further contributed to the impression of greater understanding and concealed his level of difficulty.  However, when asked about the passage in the ABE interview where the police officer attempts to explore truth and lies by the use of an example, EE considered that Z would have struggled to understand as it was too long and complex.  </span></p>

He was also unusually disruptive and physical in the playground with other children, to the point that he could not be left unsupervised or he would have been fighting every day, and she remained close to him throughout so that she could intervene or calm him down.  The information available from M Primary School CPOMS was not passed on as it should have been until after the precipitating events in March 2022, but meant that the staff at J Primary School were unaware of his history of disruptive and challenging behaviour.</span></p>

I note that the children are reluctant to mention A to others, but that Z had mentioned A (except for his name) to EE.  There is a risk therefore that he would not have named A in any event, even to EE, if A was directly involved. However, Z shares a bed with Y and there is no evidence that A has been visiting or sleeping over with his brothers since his arrest, let alone any evidence of his sharing a bed.

II said she had inappropriate sexual matters in mind, and that until she spoke to GG those concerns had not occurred to GG until II had pointed them out to her.

I query whether this mode of managing the telephone conversation added to the misreporting of the referral in the MASH Note by way of some series of miscommunications alongside the inappropriate summarising exercise that I have already discussed, but it is impossible to know with any certainty.</span></p>

Nowhere else is Z recorded using those words, but uses the terms &#8216;willy&#8217;, &#8216;bum&#8217; and &#8216;private/s&#8217;.  HH confirmed in her evidence that the school encourages the use of correct anatomical terms rather than slang or informal names.  GG was &#8216;as clear as I can be in my mind&#8217; that Z had used those terms &#8216;as we pay great attention to the words children use&#8217;, but confirmed that she did not think she had written &#8216;penis&#8217; down as a key word.  Nor could she remember what other word might have been used given the passage of time and her evidence that she was sure he used penis. Given that she did not think that she recorded it as a key word in her notes and he uses it nowhere else, it is unlikely that it was a word that Z used.  Given also that GG used some terminology and concepts that were somewhat prim and conservative, and where the school routinely corrects children&#8217;s terminology for sexual anatomy, I consider that it is more likely that GG substituted the words &#8216;penis&#8217; and &#8216;bottom&#8217; in place of whatever terms Z had used.  </span></p>

Y applied cream on Z&#8217;s face when he peeped again.  Y was annoyed with Z for peeping on him.

She was not entirely clear what was meant by the term &#8216;dark part&#8217; but implied that it was Y&#8217;s genital area because in her answers and statement she moved on to discuss bodily changes at puberty.

It is therefore likely that her substitutions of the word penis in her note are also likely to refer to Z&#8217;s use of the word willy.  Just because the substitution is &#8216;accurate&#8217;, a willy is slang for a penis, this does not preclude that Z hearing the word penis as a substitution for willy might not have been confusing or led him onto a different track.</span></p>

This discussion between Z and the police was then taking place at about 5/5.30pm and it had clearly been a very long and stressful day.

This element of her note and evidence related to another adult&#8217;s input into the process that evening, and was not related to the content of Z&#8217;s allegations which may have been affected by the inaccurate summary that CC had already read from the MASH Note.  For all the above reasons, including the previous points I have considered in relation to the reliability of GG&#8217;s recollections, I prefer CC&#8217;s recording in her note of 8.3.22 and her oral evidence, and I consider it is likely that GG was prompted to read out her referral to remind Z and did so.</span></p>

We cannot know what word Z used instead of bottom, but as the term used by GG is the same as the word used in relation to the slapped bottom discussed earlier, it is safe to conclude that it is likely to have been the same term used by Z and therefore Z is likely to have said poo in association with that word meaning bottom.</span></p>

The use of the word &#8216;in&#8217; in the context of &#8216;in his bottom at the back&#8217; may mean in between those buttock cheeks at the rear of the body or may have a meaning of penetration of an anus.

It is suggested that this is also a factor that he would have been experiencing here.  GG would have been providing him with her focussed one-on-one attention, supported by gently encouraging questions.

While she may have asked more questions than she at first recalled, this was a notable aspect of her evidence which was persuasive in its detail.  Although pressed as to the nature of the questions she asked, it was clear that she had a good understanding of avoiding leading questions and all the examples she gave were non-leading, open or reassuring.

Within this context, the following is said at [28]:  &#8220;The signs of child abuse might not always be obvious and a child might not tell anyone what is happening to them. You should therefore question behaviours if something seems unusual and try to speak to the child, alone, if appropriate, to seek further information&#8221;.   And at [29]: &#8220;If a child reports, following a conversation you have initiated or otherwise, that they are being abused and neglected, you should listen to them, take their allegation seriously, and reassure them that you will take action to keep them safe.&#8221;</span></p>

I venture to suggest that&#160;whenever&#160;a referral is received in a case that raises allegations of sexual abuse the social worker or police officer allocated to the case should,&#160;before&#160;they do anything else, pause and remind themselves of the following checklist of ten cardinal principles:</span></p>

	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p style="margin-left:0.6in"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">i)The investigation of child sexual abuse is a demanding, complex and sensitive task and should be undertaken by those who have received the requisite training.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">ii)&#160;Very great professional care is required when dealing with allegations of child sexual abuse, both in the initial phases and at the ABE interview stage.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">iii)&#160;Whatever the nature of the child&#8217;s presentation, and whether the response is immediate, prompt or deferred, the response of professionals and the police must be planned.&#160; Children&#8217;s best interests are rarely served by precipitate action.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">iv)&#160;The primary principles governing, and the procedures for the investigation and assessment of alleged child sexual abuse are those set out in&#160;Achieving Best Evidence 2011&#160;and&#160;Working Together 2018&#160;and must be followed in all cases.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">v)&#160;Any investigation into child sexual abuse that focuses attention on the statements of the child runs the risk of producing a false result if what the child says is unreliable, or if the child&#8217;s primary caretaker is unreliable.&#160;</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">vi)&#160;All interactions with a child who is making or appears to be making an allegation of child sexual abuse have the potential to influence that child&#8217;s memory.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">vii)&#160;Accounts given by children are susceptible to influence as the result of bias or preconceived ideas on the part of professionals and police. Those speaking to children who have made allegations of sexual abuse&#160;must&#160;keep an open mind with respect to the allegations made and&#160;must&#160;guard against the development of bias or preconceived ideas. A professional who loses their objectivity ceases, by definition, to act professionally.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">viii)&#160;Questioning the child should ordinarily be left to a formal ABE interview.&#160; If any initial questioning is necessary, it should be limited to eliciting a brief account of what is alleged to have taken place; a more detailed account should not be pursued at that stage.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">ix)&#160;Anything the child says must be recorded in a note that must detail (a) the timing, setting and people present, (b) what the child says in the words used by the&#160;child&#160;(avoiding summaries of the account in the interests of neatness or comprehensibility and avoiding recordings of the adult&#8217;s interpretation of what the child said), (c) a full note of the actual&#160;questions&#160;asked (if any) and (d) what was said by anybody else present.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">x)&#160;Overall, the proper methodology is one that combines listening to the child and taking them seriously with an open-minded approach that takes account of both sides of the story, is open to new evidence that disconfirms original ideas, that reasons dispassionately, that demands that claims be backed by evidence and that deduces and infers conclusions only from available facts.&#8221;</span></p>

There are further aspects which suggest that she misunderstood her role.  She did not view Z being transported alone by the police as inappropriate.  She left the police station prior to Z&#8217;s interview, but after having pointed out that Z was already tired and been waiting a long time.  She said she was not aware he would be interviewed without a social worker but I have no evidence that she took steps to clarify this and make arrangements.

It is clear from DC B&#8217;s approach during the ABE interview, as discussed later in this judgment, that knowing what questions were asked by him here is critically important, and that without the questions understanding the reliability of any interpretation of the answers is dubious and extremely difficult.  I also note that her record shows at least six questions plus the prompting exercise, and her oral evidence indicated that a great deal more questions must have been asked.  Given the question-heavy ABE interview process that followed, it is impossible to know without those questions being noted here how many more had to be asked, how many misunderstandings took place, how many concepts or preconceived notions were conveyed and led.</span></p>

It is not noted by CC or in the police records what discussions were held between them prior to the initial questioning.  I note that DC B&#8217;s CRIS entry refers to the police being &#8216;informed of the referral&#8217; but without a Form 87a being sent.  A Form 87a is sent within 24 hours by the social worker to the police Child Abuse Investigation Team giving notice of a relevant incident in order to ensure that the police are involved in any strategy meeting.

I note that by this time in the evening the police must have been aware of the parents&#8217; very limited abilities in English and that therefore Z&#8217;s first language and that used at home would have been .  Given the already evident language issues from the initial questioning (for example &#8216;pinkie feet&#8217;) and what has been evident to every professional reporting on Z&#8217;s communication skills, this poses particular difficulties.  It is also almost immediately evident in the interview when Z uses the word &#8216;invitation&#8217; in a context that makes no sense but appears to relate to the police&#8217;s written account of what Z might say.</span></p>

This was used in a confusing way with EE when Z was demonstrating and describing the scratch to his neck.  He repeated this during the initial questioning at school.  He repeated it in the ABE interview where he again referred to being pinched on the right side of his neck, but this time referred to this being done by his brother&#8217;s leg while making a motion of his foot towards his neck.  This may or may not have been an invention, however DC B queried this which prompted Z to change his description and refer to the use of his hand.  Although, crucially, it is not possible to be sure what Z meant, it is telling that it appears that the word pinch may have been used in the place of the term scratch.  He may have mistaken the word due to interpretation/language issues. He may have used the wrong word as in the SALT report (dolphin/whale).  He may have meant he was indeed scratched by his brother&#8217;s toenails.  However, the lack of appropriate preparation, language and intermediary support led to confusion, and DC B&#8217;s reaction which prompted Z to change his account as to the body part, and not to clarify the term used for the action.  </span></p>

It is argued that but for the multiple failings on this topic Z would not have compliantly provided answers to try to &#8216;make sense of&#8217; his scratch/pinch leg/hand &#8216;errors&#8217; and to please his questioner, and that this led Z to make his first reference to Y moving over towards him and using the term &#8216;scrolled&#8217; as a way to &#8216;correctly&#8217; answer and explain this part of his account. It is hereafter that the willy/bum account progresses with multiple references to scrolling around and adds to the lack of clarity and unreliability of Z&#8217;s account.

He sets out a few parameters, and states &#8216;Once we&#8217;ve finished the interview you can go back to your mum and dad&#8217; and &#8216;when you tell me what happened&#8217; and &#8216;Your mum knows what happened&#8217; and &#8216;That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re doing this&#8217;.  It is wholly unclear what Z might have felt and understood in response to these comments.  It is not a clear explanation of what the interview was for.  It begs the questions of why they were engaged in the interview or what it would mean to &#8216;finish&#8217; the interview so that a tired 8 year old could be reunited with his parents, and of what Z might be thinking of in relation to M already knowing what had happened.

Z gets it wrong and DC B ends up prompting him with the correct response. He follows up by a further confused attempt by suggesting lies would get him into trouble rather than establishing that Z understands truth/lies, and then says &#8216;are you happy you understand?&#8217;.  In doing so he induces an acquiescence in relation to a critical matter that Z has not demonstrated he understands correctly.  These are obvious breaches of important considerations DC B is required to observe, namely the risks of acquiescence and the automatic positive responses children can give (sections 3.37 and 3.78).  This lack of established understanding is a significant breach going to the weight that can be given to the evidence obtained (</span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">R v B [2010] EWCA Crim 4</span><span style="font-size:12pt">).</span></p>

However, there are a significant amount of leading, prompting and suggestive questions that do not give Z an opportunity to find his own words (section 3.32), at times introducing new words or concepts, or inviting yes/no answers which will be at high risk of inducing acquiescence and &#8216;unconditional positive responding&#8217; (section 3.37).  This proves to be particularly problematic given, for example, the variable use by Z of the prepositions &#8216;on/in/to&#8217; in relation to willy/bum, and leaves the court unable to decipher what Z actually meant.</span></p>

Z explains that he is wearing &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">swarters</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217; not pyjamas.  This term is not clarified and it is impossible to understand what Z meant and therefore whether it might have had relevance to details subsequently elicited about clothing.  DC B continues with questions about underwear and asks &#8216;And what is your brother wearing?/He wear pyjamas/&#8230;And what pyjamas are they?/Superheroes&#8217;.  Z then can&#8217;t remember the name of the superhero nor the colour of the pyjamas.  He is challenged and asked again &#8216;You don&#8217;t remember - you don&#8217;t know what colour his pyjamas are?&#8217; and answers &#8216;They&#8217;re red&#8217;.  Thus DC B effectively introduced the concept of pyjamas being worn.  Z then responded as above, without clarification of which brother he is referring to. (If I accept M&#8217;s evidence, it is U who has red superhero pyjamas, which at age 6 appears far more likely than Y aged almost 12, and Y does not fit both the top and bottom of the same set of pyjamas due to his size and prefers to wear a t-shirt and underwear in bed.)  This is an important example of a novel concept being suggested, additional language/terminology issues, confusion over clearly identifying who Z is referring to, but leading to Z referring to a superhero pyjama-wearing brother, which may well be a form of acquiescence to the initial suggestion and providing an answer to please the questioner, and neither of them challenging or realising there was confusion and a lack of understanding. </span></p>

I have taken into account the noted references to M and Z apparently referring to it being due to itching, but for the reasons discussed I am not persuaded that this means it was due to eczema.

There is no solid evidential foundation that he has introduced them to inappropriate material, visited them, discussed sexual matters with them, directly communicated with them or directly abused them, or otherwise has any connection with these allegations.  There is evidence that both boys were taken through Keep Safe work in 2020 with V Council, where neither made any allegation of having experienced abusive behaviour and were considered to have a good sense of good and bad touches.  Y told CC that he had been asked then about whether A had touched him and that he had explained that he had not.

I also note that, looking back with a fuller understanding of the way in which the LA and police pursued this case from the outset, his reactions need to be considered in that light.  He was arrested for &#8216;anal rape&#8217;.  He was interviewed on the basis of a wide range of assaultative behaviour, but was interviewed in relation to anal penetration and possible injuries to Z&#8217;s anus.  Although I have not seen the pre-interview disclosure Y will have discussed with his solicitor, it is highly likely it referred to anal rape given that is what he had just been arrested for. The LA personnel had approached this from a perspective that was distorted to believe a &#8216;disclosure&#8217; of anal penetration had been made and should be accepted without a more careful and thoughtful approach.  That would have informed the discussion between him and CC in April 2022. He was therefore reacting, in his denials, to allegations that included anal rape.  This has not permitted a more nuanced or graduated approach to the allegations and Y&#8217;s responses.</span></p>

I note that Y was particularly upset on seeing Z by chance on one occasion 7.4.22, to the extent that Z comforted him.  Looked at in the round, that can be seen as an unusual response by someone who has been wrongly accused.

M&#8217;s report that Z said &#8216;I&#8217;ve made a mistake&#8217; does not provide much assistance to the court by itself save to point to a potential regret in the context of the family missing Y and Z realising that his discussions with teachers and the police had led to Y&#8217;s absence.  The nature of the mistake is unclear and might relate simply to having had those discussions rather than to having told any lie.  However, it is in that context that I note that Z has not retracted his allegations.  If he thought he had made a mistake by saying untruthful things, and was as upset about it as M described, it is reasonable to think that he could have corrected such a mistake by explaining that his allegations had been untrue.  If in fact the mistake was to share secrets then there is no means of taking it back, hence no retraction, unless an 8 year old is then prepared to tell a wholly different and untrue story in itself, namely that the truths he had told were all untrue.  He has not repeated or built on his allegations &#8211; a factor relied upon on Y&#8217;s behalf.

I note that Z said he did not tell M about penis issues.  I also note that M acknowledged some limited fighting and squabbling at home, albeit perhaps inconsistently and possibly minimised.  M also included the Hydromol incident in her statement.  I am unclear that there is such a blanket denial for the LA to rely on.

In any event, the parents had agreed to supervise any contact he might have.  It appears that they chose instead not to permit any such contact save for a short visit with the V social worker present just before they left V, and overhearing the speakerphone conversations that M explained that she has regularly with A.  There was a single example that Y gave of a phone call where his homework was discussed, but which did not depart from M&#8217;s evidence that this was a joint call which she conducted.  The LA asserts that the content of her first and second statement establish she has lied about this in that she concedes this phone call took place whereas she had earlier stated that he had &#8216;not seen or spoken to them in person or virtually&#8217; since that last short supervised visit.  I am not persuaded that this is a significant lie.  There is no evidence he has visited, had other direct contact, one-to-one video chats or one-to-one calls.  There is therefore no evidence of illicit contact that the parents would need the children to hide.</span></p>

I have not heard evidence from the foster carer who noted M&#8217;s interaction with Z on the street, and how what she reports Z said might or might not fit with M&#8217;s explanation that she was discouraging Z from talking or asking about A on the street.  It is simply not possible to know what F or M had said in their shared South Asian language.  In the context of my finding above, it becomes even less likely that the parents were attempting to encourage ongoing concealment by the children, particularly where they themselves had by then discussed A with CC and the police who were well aware of his convictions, the background and his whereabouts.</span></p>

It is entirely understandable that they would not want A&#8217;s convictions and situation to become known in the general community and that they should have a fresh start.  It was, however, bizarre that M attempted to deny at one point that the family had wanted a fresh start as recorded by the V social work documents.  A fresh start would be reasonable to want in these circumstances.  It is suggestive of a thread visible in M&#8217;s evidence and approach: that she is wary of admitting difficult issues openly or being picked up on matters that she fears (whether rightly or not) might reflect badly on her and the family.</span></p>

M denies this and points out the lack of adequate interpretation, that she thought she was being asked about how many children she had living at home and she was intensely worried about these allegations she was just hearing about.  Given CC&#8217;s subsequent oral evidence about how anxious and upset M was, asking for water and to sit down and calling on Allah, it is inappropriate to place too much weight on M&#8217;s responses on that day.  This is borne out by DC B&#8217;s note in the police records from April 2022 that when M was discussing A with him she said she had not mentioned it on 7.3.22 as &#8216;her head was all over the place&#8217; due to concerns about Z and Y.</span></p>

Both parents indicated that their understanding of A&#8217;s offending was actually very limited until late last year, despite the work done by V Council.  They have become more closely aware following the police disclosure in these proceedings, supported by legal advice and representation.  It is true to say that even with general work done by V Council, the parents would not have had sight of the police statements, probation report and sentencing remarks until the police disclosure within these proceedings.  M went to A&#8217;s sentencing hearing but there was no interpreter.  I can appreciate that V Council may well have been able to carry out risk assessment and family assessment work with only the outline being known &#8211; namely A accessing inappropriate material on the internet involving indecent images of children.</span></p>

F also stated that he had rarely spoken with A about his convictions and does not do so now.  M&#8217;s approach was more variable.  She could occasionally voice an acknowledgement of some sort of risk and acknowledged that A had shown a sexual interest in children by virtue of the possession of the images, but she could not connect that with any active risk to her younger children as she had &#8216;never seen it&#8217;.</span></p>

F&#8217;s evidence was that the children had access to his room while playing around the house, particularly during lockdown.  I prefer F&#8217;s account.  It is more realistic, more natural, and M&#8217;s evidence involved frequent minimisation.  I note the context of the Keep Safe work which did not in fact reveal any exposure, but that the parents appear to have relied on that work, as M revealed in her oral evidence, rather than on their own engaged parenting to address these issues.  I consider that M was here attempting to minimise the level of risk the children might have been exposed to. </span></p>

I cannot be certain as to the exact reasons, which should be the focus of appropriate work to assist them, but in both their cases it is likely that ignorance, shame, aversion, and a natural desire to minimise such an issue relating to a loved family member may all be in play. In F&#8217;s case it is also likely that his limited cognitive abilities will have made it harder to understand abstract concepts of risk, and to consider that simply because you don&#8217;t &#8216;see&#8217; something does not mean it is not a problem.</span></p>

He said that despite the Safety Plan and related work with V children&#8217;s services that the parents have not received advice on how to explain A&#8217;s situation to the children.  While this excruciating difficulty is on the one hand understandable, it does leave the boys at risk due to: believing an untruth, being discouraged from discussing or naming A, and not knowing that A himself may pose a risk to them.</span></p>

Instead of being open to the parents&#8217; fears and worries, prepared to look at the situation in the round with dispassionate curiosity alongside child protection principles, there was a culture of belief centred around an inaccurate allegation of anal rape, which was pursued from an early stage without access to proper information as to Z&#8217;s vulnerabilities that require particular care to be taken when managing and interpreting his communication.  </span></p>

They also rely on M describing Z as wanting everything and feeling jealous, for example over the computer.  However, I do not follow their argument that this is also demonstrated by M behaving appropriately when alerted by J Primary School about Z&#8217;s need for guidance on boundaries.  </span></p>

She states that she may not have sufficiently overseen the children&#8217;s access to the internet due to her busyness on first moving to London and when the children were waiting for a month before school places became available.  I consider that it is quite natural for these parents, whose oldest son accessed indecent paedophilic material on the internet, to consider that the internet might be the source of the problems.  However, it is notable that M does not include Y in this consideration, as to whether he may have sourced inappropriate behaviour from the internet, rather than her approach simply that Z may have sourced a false allegation.  </span></p>

I note that Y had no contact with M until after this date.  He had contact with F on 30.3.22 when there was some initial discussion in his South Asian language, contrary to the request that the parents speak in English or that an interpreter would be provided.  I note that F speaks little English and the language used within this family is a South Asian language.  There was no interpreter present.  While F needed reminding, I note that this was their first contact, after tumultuous events and without an interpreter. When the supervisor reminded them to speak in English I note that Y responded with an answer in English: &#8216;No I do not like my foster placement&#8217;.  This does not establish any coordination or manipulation of Y by informing him of what to say as part of a parental narrative.</span></p>

Nothing of the sort has been mentioned by him to anyone.  I have noted that all contact with Z has shown warm, loving, uncomplicated affection between all parents and all siblings.  I do not consider that there is sufficient evidence to establish a finding that the parents have exposed Z to significant emotional harm in this way or to their initial use of the word liar at the first meeting with CC or to their subsequent doubts or reluctance to believe him.</span></p>

They have stated that they do not know what to think and are open to the possibilities.  However, it has emerged clearly from their evidence that the parents have found it far harder to think that Y may have done something than that Z may have invented something or &#8216;made a mistake&#8217;, and it is this line that they have pursued.  This has not been assisted by the LA&#8217;s approach, which if anything is likely to have driven them further into an entrenched effort to find an alternative approach than that pursued by the LA.  It would be a mistake to characterise this as a &#8216;narrative&#8217; with its connotation of artificiality and device.  But I do consider that the parents have a resistance, a blind-spot or a shut-down approach which has prevented them from being able to perceive or accept the implications of Y behaving as Z has described.  This resistance is to some extent understandable given what they must fear it might mean for their family, but I am satisfied that it has left Z at significant risk of harm due to his parents casting around for ways that point away from his allegations being true and by so doing disabling themselves from developing their insight and being fully open to any needs he may have for their protection.</span></p>

M&#8217;s evidence in relation to the boys&#8217; behaviour towards each other and whether they fight or playfight has been referred to already above.  It was another example of a topic that was notable for being denied, reluctantly conceded and inconsistent.  I note her own evidence about the Hydromol incident where Z peeked in on Y, Y reacted by putting cream on Z&#8217;s face and Z was angry and complained to her about Y&#8217;s behaviour.

Two observations follow however: there is a significant enough age and size difference that Z needs to be appropriately supported; and as I have discussed above, denial and minimisation by his parents leaves him at risk of being scapegoated, his needs not being met, and his safety not protected.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that this leaves Z at risk of significant harm.</span></p>

It is not possible to establish on the balance of probability that this reticence is due to a fault in the parents&#8217; care of the children rather than a host of wider issues, particularly where my findings are necessarily limited to concluding that those incidents took place once.  Accordingly, I do not find that this is made out as a threshold criterion, albeit this too is likely to require careful understanding and work so that the children feel able to share information openly.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1.1in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Most unfortunately given Y&#8217;s age and the importance of managing such a young suspect correctly, both of the arresting officers failed to remember to save their body-worn camera footage of the arrest correctly.  A specific step needs to be taken to save the footage for a specified longer period such as five years once the footage has been downloaded.  That download often only completes many hours after the camera is docked following its use.  The footage is only kept for a default period of 30 days unless that step is taken at that delayed point.  It appears that this is what happened in this case.  The arresting officer gave evidence of her regret and that she has changed her practice now to always save the footage separately onto the case file to avoid such an error, and if necessary she will also now create a case file if none yet exists in order to do so.</span></p>
