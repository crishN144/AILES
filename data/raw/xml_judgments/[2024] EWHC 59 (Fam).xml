	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am writing this judgment in the expectation that, at some point, it will be seen by the two children it concerns, S and T.  I have tried to summarise the decisions made in earlier proceedings, so they will have an unbiased and objective account of what happened in court as they were growing up.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue for this court is whether it is in T&#8217;s best interests for contact to continue in the current form between him and the respondent father.  T is now aged 15.  He has a sister, S who will be 18 soon.  There is no suggestion that the contact arrangements should continue in her case.  She has stopped seeing her father and that will not change.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If I decide contact is to continue, there is a separate issue about whether it should continue beyond T&#8217;s 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday up to the age of 18 or whether in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/9/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 9(6)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> the order should have no effect from that date.  The mother argues that no order for contact should be made based on T&#8217;s wishes and feelings and that contact should stop now whilst the father contends that it is in T&#8217;s best interests that an order be made to last until he is aged 18.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment the mother has spent at least ten years persuading first S and now T that she was a victim of abuse and that the father is a violent abusive man.  This is untrue.  Where we have reached in December 2023, is that S is about to be 18 and does not want to see her father and T no doubt influenced not only by S but by older half-siblings, says he feels the same.   </p>

There was also to be two days in each half term which, if possible, were to be added to one of T&#8217; weekends with his father.  Apart from the provision for two weeks in the summer, my order was a return to an order made by Mrs Justice Parker in 2018.</p>

There was a contact dispute and District Judge Hollow conducted a hearing on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2013.   The Judge had accepted a recommendation of weekly contact which the mother resisted on the basis that the children did not want it.  When the father wanted to send Christmas presents by a delivery service to the children the mother said that the children did not want to receive any from the father.  The two younger children would have been about five and seven years of age at the time. </p>

He described that the relationship between the two was &#8220;always difficult&#8221; as the father was &#8220;rigid in his thinking&#8221;.  At one point the Judge said that between selling one house and buying another in 2012, the mother reported herself as homeless.  He said that was extraordinary behaviour and dishonest.

One where the mother was &#8220;stupid to get out of the car&#8221; and the father &#8220;was callous in leaving her there&#8221;.   The Judge said the father was &#8220;pig-headed and awkward and that led to the temporary separation&#8221;.   The second was where the father picked up a knife and said the mother may as well stab him.  The Judge said it was dramatic scene and the father was not being sensible.  There was an allegation that the mother made of the father assaulting her on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2013 when they were arguing.  This went to the criminal court and the father was found not guilty.   Judge Yelton too found the assault did not happen.  </p>

The father admitted honestly that there was truth in their eldest sibling&#8217;s evidence that he had singled her out and verbally abused her on one occasion.  He said it was because she would not grow up at the same speed as the younger of the two older siblings.

She summarised them: &#8220;I made strong findings (but rightly strong, in my view) that what has gone wrong with these children is very largely down to the mother's influence and the influences the children are subjected to in the mother's household, where frankly there is a strong anti-father feeling shared by the children's two elder half-siblings.  As I said at the time, however, although both parents are intelligent, I regard the mother as being of particularly high intellectual ability and I also, although I may not have used these precise words, found her to be both manipulative and devious when it comes to getting her own way.  I found the father to be rather naive in his presentation, perhaps even crass in his presentation, with a much less sophisticated approach than that of the mother.  He was found by Mr Darren Spooner (a psychologist) and Judge Yelton to be basically a decent man, and that I agree with, but he is not subtle nor particularly insightful when it comes to dealings with others.  That seems to me relevant to Judge Yelton's findings.   However, I found the mother's allegations of domestic abuse and harassment, completely and utterly overblown and unbelievable&#8221;. </p>

T and S were both displaying some significant psychological distress at having contact with him. T had &#8220;mildly elevated anxiety and moderately elevated symptoms of depression&#8221;.   S had anxiety and depression within the average range which was lower than the symptoms she had described to the psychologist.  Dr Phipps said that was because S did not want to be labelled as suffering from anxiety etc as it might affect her career opportunities.</p>

Although he does not recognise this currently, having another adult parent who cares for him deeply and has his best interests at heart, may be helpful in the years ahead as he finds his way in the world.  His father could assist him with his emotional needs if only the mother gave him permission to like his father let alone love him.  The father has no psychological problems, the only thing he has wanted is to see the children he loves but they have been manipulated into believing he harmed their mother and would harm them.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">T said his father frightened him, but the only example given to me by both young people was the same one.   The father walked down the centre of a street in Cambridge stopping the traffic and being honked at.  I accept that the children at their ages would have found it excruciatingly embarrassing but to say that caused them harm is an exaggeration.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A description of the father was given by T to Dr Phipps.  Essentially, the father is rude to people and critical of them.  What was described by T matched Mrs Justice Parker&#8217;s description of the father as &#8220;spontaneous and uninhibited, sometimes abrasively so, in a way that most might find rude, or at the least inappropriate&#8221;.   S&#8217;s recording echoes what T also said which is that the father was always saying nasty things about the mother.  Unfortunately, the father lacks insight and is insensitive still.  The father has not changed in the same way the mother has not.</p>

It is undoubtedly the case that a father&#8217;s involvement with his children is something to be encouraged for all sorts of obvious reasons.</p>

It would be futile to force him to continue and inappropriate of me not to recognise his wishes and feelings in that respect.</p>

I am confident that if I made no order on the basis that making no order was better than making an order, then there would be no contact at all from now on between this father and their son.  Miss Scotland&#8217;s submission that he could then choose to see his father when he wanted is exactly the argument deployed in relation to S who has not seen her father since her 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday.  </p>

The order will continue until his 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday and not beyond.</p>

The mid-week contact will stop but the other contact will continue as before.</p>

It was petty of the mother to refuse to tell the court where T was doing this.  This failure is nothing to do with something harmful happening to T but everything to do with the mother continuing to exclude the father from T&#8217; life and to hurt him intentionally.  </p>

It seemed to me that the father should be able to take T to the rowing or collect him (depending on the timing).  He can drop him around the corner, so T is not embarrassed by his father.  T may be surprised that many teenagers his age find their parents excruciatingly embarrassing, and he will not be alone with these feelings.</p>

T may well go celebrating with his friends on a holiday as many young people do.  The father&#8217;s summer contact is to take place before his 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday and will be for two weeks.  Sadly, despite the able submissions of Miss Scotland, I consider that will be the last contact T will have with his father for a number of years.</p>

I have no doubt this has been the mother&#8217;s aim for many years and the court has been able to recognise her manipulation but has been powerless to ensure that the children have a balanced upbringing knowing both parents and both sides of the family.  It is a source of frustration and regret.</p>
