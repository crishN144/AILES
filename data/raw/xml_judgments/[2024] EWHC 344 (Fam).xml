The Local Authority (&#8220;LA&#8221;) issued proceedings in respect of H at birth, but H has remained in the care of her parents since birth. The issue in the case is whether the risk of her remaining with her parents is such that removal is now proportionate. </p>

The first part deals with findings of fact in respect of an incident that occurred in or around October 2023. The second part concerns H&#8217;s best interests. On Day Two of the hearing I gave a ruling in respect of the facts found, but reserved my reasons. The reasons are set out below. For the second part, much of the family background is relevant, which I set out in detail from [50] below.</p>

This has significant implications for their care of the children, and for the evidence that they gave. H has four older siblings, D a male aged 25, E a male aged 20, F a male aged 17 and G a girl aged 14. For the purposes of the case before me, E and G are largely out of the picture. By the time H was born D, E and G were all in placements away from the family home, and Care Orders had been made in respect of E and G.  F was made the subject of a care order on 11 February 2021 and remained at home at the time of the incident. He has lived away from home since 7 November 2023, when the allegations were made to the police. </p>

This order was made with the agreement of all the parties, and there was no substantive hearing of any of the issues that had been considered by HHJ Lopez. A Safety Plan was drawn up, by which the parents agreed that one of them would be present when F and H were together, and that F&#8217;s interactions with H would be carefully monitored. A list of rules identified other adults deemed to pose a risk of harm to H, and placed limitations on their contact with H. These included D, E, and maternal uncles ND and SD.</p>

She, the Mother, H, SD, F and D had all been at the MGM&#8217;s house. SD lives with his mother, the MGM. MC had (until the falling out after she spoke to the police on 6 November) usually gone round at the weekends.</p>

D, F and H were in the MGM&#8217;s bedroom, which is a small room adjoining the front room. SD was in the kitchen and the Mother had gone out to the kitchen with SD. MC said that she had been sitting on a settee which looked into the bedroom. She saw H jumping on the bed and singing. She then saw F, who was on the bed push H onto the bed and pull off her t-shirt and put his hand down her leggings. He then pulled down D&#8217;s trousers. MC said she called for the Mother who came back into the front room from the kitchen.</p>

Ms McGrath suggests that the focus on the date, rather than the underlying allegations, was a deliberate choice, and indeed something of a cover-up by the other family members. </p>

The LA, however, also rely on what they say are a number of breaches of the working agreement, which they say show the family is unable to work with the LA. Mr Ellis&#8217; principal concern, and that emphasised by Ms McGrath in closing, is a failure to work openly and honestly with the LA. In terms of specific issues, Mr Ellis relied on the incident which was the trigger for notifying the parents that the LA intended to place H in foster care, and the report by H&#8217;s nursery that when they were changing her nappy she had redness in her genital area. When this was seen, H was examined by Dr Wolska, and her report says that the findings were neutral. In other words, they might have been indicative of some form of abuse, but they might equally have been entirely benign. H at the time was still wearing nappies, and there is a report that her nappy was &#8220;full&#8221; that morning. I find it impossible to place any weight on the redness because it could so easily simply have been a small case of nappy rash. There is a danger of building a house of straws against the parents in this case.</p>

MC&#8217;s evidence in this regard is more difficult. I have found that she was truthful in at least part of what she said about the incident in the bedroom, largely because it is now accepted that she made an allegation against F immediately. However, by at least November, she does seem to have become motivated by some level of animosity to F. </p>

This is a rather tangential issue in my view. By the summer of 2023 the LA were concerned that F was spending time with ND and this was taking him away from the more beneficial work at LifeShed. In the LA&#8217;s view, and probably with good reason, ND was a very poor influence on F. However, the working agreement was, on this point, unworkable and setting the parents up to fail. It is impossible to see how the parents could have been supervising H 24/7 and at the same time stopping F being unsupervised with ND. So that breach is accepted but tells me little about the parents&#8217; ability to protect H. </p>

None of the older children now live at home, and their ability to be at home is very severely curtailed by Care Orders and other restrictions. Therefore, the situation where the Mother could plainly not cope and control the children, and where indeed she appears to have been subject of abuse, is no longer the case. All the reports from the many social work visits is that of a calm household where H is well cared for and her needs met.</p>

D lives elsewhere and is not allowed to stay overnight, or to be unsupervised with H. The LA suspect that D does sometimes stay overnight because of a visit they made when he was there quite early in the morning. But he sometimes stays, and is allowed to stay, with a friend nearby and his being in the house was not itself a breach. I also note that the risk assessment of D appears to largely see him as a victim of potential abuse rather causing a risk. Having read the history, this may not be entirely accurate, but it is certainly the prevailing perception.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, Ms Anslow relies on the fact that F now lives elsewhere and is not allowed to visit the family home. In my view this is an important point. The working agreement was always going to be very difficult for the parents given that F and H were living in the same house. It is not clear to me how the Mother was going to supervise H with F 24/7 when they were all living together. But that situation has now changed, with F living elsewhere. Although it is not possible to be certain that F does not meet with H when with the parents, a point to which I return below, it is a great deal easier for the Mother in particular to understand and stick by the rules when F is not living with her. </p>

I fully understand this concern and will address it in my conclusions. However, I was troubled by the fact that the Guardian, certainly in his written report, did not in my view properly weigh up the harm (or risk) to H from being placed into foster care, as against the risk of her being with her parents. He referred to H suffering &#8220;short-term&#8221; harm if she was removed from her parents&#8217; care, which in my view significantly understated that side of the balance. Further, he said virtually nothing about the problems of long term foster care for H, an issue which invariably features very heavily in Cafcass reports when arguing for a placement order rather than long term foster care. </p>

This is the appropriate test when deciding whether the child should be removed under an interim care order, pending determination of an application under s.31 of the Children Act : Re L-A (Children) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/822" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 822" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 822</ref> . The same test should also apply when a local authority's decision to remove a child placed at home under a care order has led to an application by the parents to discharge the order and the court has to decide whether the child should be removed pending determination of the discharge application. As set out above, under s.33(4) of the 1989, the local authority may not exercise its powers under a care order to determine how a parent may exercise his or her parental responsibility for the child unless satisfied it is necessary to do so to safeguard or promote the child's welfare. For a local authority to remove a child in circumstances where its welfare did not require it would be manifestly unlawful and an unjustifiable interference with the family's Article 8 rights.</span></p>

But that is not the issue in the case, in my view. The issue is the approach a local authority should take to changing the care plan under the care order and, whilst the established level of concern and background established by the care order is there, the previously proportionate plan of having a child at home, if it is to be changed, has to be changed after a proper consideration and assessment of all of the available evidence and in a way that meets the child and the mother&#8217;s human rights as described in the earlier decisions. </span></p>

In fact, given the existence of the emergency protection order procedure and, in contrast, the limited options available to a parent in a case such as this, the human rights considerations require that the quality of the process should be at least as high, if not higher, than in an emergency protection order case. It is not the function of this court to lay down strictures as to the sort of assessment work that should be put in place before a radical change of care plan such as this, but it does seem that some form of formal assessment, whether it is called a core assessment or otherwise which draws together all of the evidence in a considered way rather than simply at LAC meetings or other professional gatherings, and gives the parent a chance to contribute to that process, and then takes stock of all of that material in the way that a core assessment would do, is the level of intervention and planning that should be brought to bear before a change of care plan as draconian as this takes place.&#8221;</span></p>

Further, the matter did then promptly come back to Court and the LA have been very reasonable in not seeking to remove H on an interim basis.

As foreshadowed at the start of this judgment, there must be (to borrow a phrase from a different context) an intense focus on the type of risk that is involved, how likely it is to happen, and what the likely consequences might then be. Only by carrying out this exercise is it possible to know what weight to give to the risks before setting them alongside other relevant factors. So, for example, the risk of further physical harm to a child who has been severely injured by a denying parent is likely to be a factor of predominant weight. By contrast, to borrow from the evidence in this case, where a mother who untruthfully denies drinking goes to a park at night to drink alone, leaving her baby with its grandmother, the court will view that risk with a sense of proportion.</span></p>

Lies, however deplorable, are significant only to the extent that they affect the welfare of the child, and in particular to the extent that they undermine systems of protection designed to keep the child safe. However, as noted by Macur LJ in Re Y (A Child) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1337" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1337" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1337</ref> , they cannot be allowed to hijack the case.

Sometimes the linkage will be obvious, as where the facts proved establish physical harm. But the linkage may be very much less obvious where the allegation is only that the child is at risk of suffering emotional harm or, as in the present case, at risk of suffering neglect. In the present case, as we shall see, an important element of the local authority's case was that the father "lacks honesty with professionals", "minimises matters of importance" and "is immature and lacks insight of issues of importance". Maybe. But how does this feed through into a conclusion that A is at risk of neglect? The conclusion does not follow naturally from the premise. The local authority's evidence and submissions must set out the argument and explain explicitly why it is said that, in the particular case, the conclusion indeed follows from the facts."</span></p>

The Mother needs to be shown simple concepts and then have regular work to make sure those concepts have remained firmly in place. In some regards the working agreement set her up to fail, because the level of supervision of H with F living in the house was probably unrealistic, and she was never going to be able to supervise F with ND. Further, considering the dynamics of this family, and the role that the Mother seems to have played in the past, it was probably unrealistic to think that she could control F. Much of the background history suggests that the Mother has been, in many respects, a victim of what was happening in the family home.</p>

But there is a high potential that once H goes into foster care she will never return to the care of her parents. She is currently very strongly bonded to her mother. Although the current plan is twice weekly supervised contact, it is easy to see that H may become very upset at leaving her mother, and the result will be a reduction in contact so that she bonds better with the foster carer(s). Once she has been removed, it will be hard for the parents to show that they have sufficiently learnt, for H to be returned to them. The risks to H&#8217;s long term emotional and psychological well being of being removed from a loving and attentive mother, with the very real possibility of her spending the rest of her childhood in local authority care, are very real. </p>

As the Guardian said, the LA might make a placement application and it is possible that would be granted, although I am sure it would be very strongly resisted. But H is now of an age where she will probably remember her birth family, so none of the future possible options are risk free. It is a common mantra that long term foster care is not a good outcome, albeit in many cases there may be little or no choice. </p>

H can remain with her parents whilst they complete the work with Ms Carboni and a more clearcut safety plan is put in place. That will have to entail F not having contact with H, save perhaps in public places or a contact centre. It will involve further work with the Mother&#8217;s advocate, explaining to her the utmost importance of telling the LA what is happening, and trusting the LA and the Court. The risks cannot be eliminated, but that is the truth of many parenting situations. </p>

There will have to be LA monitoring, but I do not think the level of monitoring that is happening at the moment actually achieves very much. The key will be that H is seen regularly at nursery; that there are for the moment at least weekly visits, and that there are unannounced visits. I fully appreciate the disbenefits of Care Orders at home, as explained in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re JW</span>, but this is a truly exceptional case. It cannot be proportionate within Article 8(2) to remove a child from her family because there are problems with making a Care Order at home. For these reasons, in my view a Care Order at home remains the proportionate outcome. </p>
