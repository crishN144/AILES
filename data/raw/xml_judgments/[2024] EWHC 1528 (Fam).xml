	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Assuming that the parties to a child arrangements order application are the mother and father of the child, I take a shared lives with order to be one where the court orders that the child shall live with the mother and shall live with the father and then divides the children&#8217;s time between living with each, whether that is equal time or otherwise. The Judge called such an order a shared care order but I shall adopt the terminology of the current wording of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s8</ref> and refer to a shared lives with order.  The alternative, which the Judge elected to order, was a lives with order in favour of one parent and a spend time with order in favour of the other. For shorthand I shall refer to that as a &#8220;lives with/spend time with order&#8221;. Of course there may be other kinds of child arrangements orders open to the court depending on the circumstances, for example a lives with order in favour of one parent with no time to be spent with the other parent, or a more complex order where the child&#8217;s time is divided between more than two adults. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s8</ref> gives the court wide powers and is adaptable to the many and varied forms of family life which exist. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whether an order is a shared lives with order or a lives with/spend time with order, each parent who already has parental responsibility, as in the present case, retains parental responsibility and neither parent with parental responsibility has priority over the other in terms of the exercise of parental responsibility by reason of the order. A parent who does not have parental responsibility shall have a parental responsibility order in their favour if a lives with order is made in their favour, but not if a spends time order is made in their favour. One material difference between a shared lives with order and a lives with/spend time with order that arises even if both parents have parental responsibility is created by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s13</ref> under which a parent with a lives with order may remove the child from the jurisdiction for up to a month without permission of the court or agreement of every person with parental responsibility. That is not the case for a parent without a lives with order in their favour. Nevertheless, if a child arrangements order has been made it must be complied with and so <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s13</ref> does not give the &#8220;lives with&#8221; parent free rein to take the child abroad for up to a month if by doing so the child would not spend time with the other parent as per the child arrangements order.  </p>

In doing so the court has a free hand to may make a tightly defined order for the division of time, to leave the arrangements undefined, or to make an order that lies somewhere between those two extremes, provided always that the court&#8217;s primary consideration is the best interests of the child, that the court has regard to the matters set out at <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1(3)</ref> (the welfare checklist), and that it applies the principles within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1</ref> relating to delay (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1(2)</ref>), the involvement of each parent (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1</ref>(2A)), and only making an order if it is better for the child than making no order (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1(5)</ref>). </p>

He handed down judgment on 5 January 2024 and required the parties&#8217; representatives to draw up an order to reflect his decision. The order was not perfected and approved until 29 January 2024. The Appellant&#8217;s notice was filed on 19 February 2024 and referred to five grounds of appeal. On 16 April 2024 Henke J gave the Appellant permission to appeal out of time and for the appeal to proceed on grounds 2 and 4 of the grounds of appeal but refused permission to appeal on grounds 1, 3 and 5. The Appellant requested an oral hearing of a renewed application for permission to appeal on grounds 1 and 5 but not in respect of ground 3. Henke J directed that the renewal applications be listed together with the appeals on grounds 2 and 4. On 5 June 2024 Henke J gave permission to both parties to adduce further written evidence, which is now included in the appeal bundle, but refused permission for the independent social worker (&#8220;ISW)&#8221;, to be called to give oral evidence at the appeal hearing.</p>

The Respondent petitioned for divorce whilst the parties were still living together with the children. After a while the Appellant arranged to move to a different property close to the family home but wished to move out only once child arrangements had been agreed. The parties agreed to mediation but that was unsuccessful. There were disagreements about the instruction of a child psychologist to assist the children. The Respondent raised safeguarding issues about the Appellant and stated that she wanted him to leave the family home. In early April 2022 the Appellant received a diagnosis of a very serious illness and required a course of debilitating medical treatment with a view to undergoing surgery after the conclusion of that treatment. He travelled abroad for the treatment and so was away from the children for a prolonged period in 2022. His prognosis was poor but he has so far responded very well to the treatment and surgery albeit with an as yet uncertain prognosis.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As part of his review of the procedural history, the Judge referred at paragraph [8] of his judgment to a safeguarding letter from 18 August 2022 that raised no safeguarding concerns in relation to either parent. Then at [20] he set out the 18 separate allegations the Respondent had made against the Appellant, including allegations of verbal, emotional and physical abuse of one or more of the children and coercive control of the Respondent. The Judge noted at [72] that the Respondent had withdrawn those allegations that concerned coercive control and manipulation of her including issues regarding finances. At [78] the Judge noted that the Respondent had accepted that there was no evidence that the Appellant had hit any of the children since R had been eight (some five years before the hearing). He noted at [107] that the Appellant accepted that he did used to hit R to &#8220;emphasise a point&#8221;. The Judge criticised the Appellant for his conduct in that regard but clearly considered that there were no ongoing safeguarding concerns. He recorded at [96] that the Respondent had accepted that the Appellant did not denigrate R anymore. At [101] the Judge summarised the Respondent&#8217;s position as to the remaining allegations as being that &#8220;anything she did not agree with &#8230; was presented as a demonstration of the father&#8217;s abuse: that included agreeing the children should spend flexible time with father when he was diagnosed with a terminal illness, and then criticising father for the fact that the children were exposed to that illness.&#8221; The Judge decided that it was not necessary to make any &#8220;further findings in relation to the mother&#8217;s schedule of allegations other than those already set out. The court does not find that the allegations are relevant to the children&#8217;s welfare and it is not the role of the court to engage in determining their disputes between them [the parents]&#8221; [138].</p>

For example, at [130] the Judge found that the ISW &#8220;appears to have decided that father lied on something. She then appears to have decided that as a result it undermined all of the information that father gave her&#8230; The difficult [sic.] is that may well then have contaminated her whole approach.&#8221; And at [131], &#8220;The independent social worker&#8217;s reports do not match her notes about the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings.&#8221; The Judge felt that the ISW had sided with the Respondent in an unbalanced way. The ISW was unable to give evidence due to serious illness. The Judge appears to have decided that he could not rely on her recommendations about child arrangements but did rely on information contained in her notes and reports (unless they were inconsistent) and did also appear to rely on some of her judgments &#8211; see  for example [147] of the judgment where he said that he relied on the ISW reports to find that both parents were capable of meeting the needs of the children. On my reading of the judgment as a whole the Judge accepted that the mother had sought to control contact and that this was not positive. Ground 3 of the grounds of appeal concerned the Judge&#8217;s approach to the ISW&#8217;s evidence but it is no longer pursued.</p>

When presented with closed &#8220;Yes/No&#8221; questions, instead of giving &#8220;Yes/No&#8221; answers, they would give evasive answers, or would heavily caveat their responses.  They came across as trying to control the narrative that was put before the court.  The court had to tell the parties on a number of occasions that they needed to listen to and answer the questions, but they continued to act in that way and did not change how they presented.  Father, in particular, would pick and qualify his answers to questions, leaving the court questioning whether he was seeking to avoid the truth.  Unhelpfully, he would be presented with multi-part questions, meaning he could hop around the answers and avoid answering parts which he did not want to answer and trying to split hairs on the questions that were being put forward.  To a similar degree mother would seek to deflect when answering questions.&#8221; </p>

But the court would observe, if it is not working it needs to change.

He identified the issue as being &#8220;whether there should be a shared care order or a lives with order with mother and time with the other parent&#8221; [155]. He identified certain problems that either order could present, in particular that one parent might consider they have control under an order that the children should live with that parent, or that the children might feel that they lack a solid base if &#8220;there is not a complete definition of where their base is&#8221;. Without explicit reference to specific authority, the Judge said that there is &#8220;conflicting case law about whether or not a shared care order is appropriate where parents cannot work together.&#8221;  It is not clear whether the case law to which he was referring and his concerns about shared care orders related only to cases of an equal division of time between two parents or to any shared order whatever the division of time.

He said, &#8220;that is a normal situation that you would expect between parents that are separated, and that is what we are trying to move these parents to.&#8221; He discussed possibilities for the division of time during holidays which would depend on what the holiday plans were, for example visiting other family members abroad as commonly happened in this family.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The need for appellate caution in reversing the trial judge&#8217;s evaluation of the facts is based upon much more solid grounds than professional courtesy.  It is because specific findings of fact, even by the most meticulous judge, are inherently an incomplete statement of the impression which was made upon him by primary evidence. His expressed findings are always surrounded by a penumbra of imprecision as to emphasis, relative weight, minor qualifications and nuance...of which time and language do not permit exact expression, but which may play an important part in the judge&#8217;s overall evaluation.&#8217;  </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The second point follows from the first.  The exigencies of the daily court room life are such that reasons for judgment will always be capable of having been better expressed.  This is particularly true of an unreserved judgment such as the judge gave in this case but also of a reserved judgment based upon notes, such as was given by the District Judge.  These reasons should be read on the assumption that, unless he has demonstrated the contrary, the judge knew how he should perform his functions and which matters he should take into account.&#8221;  </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"The function of the family judge in a child case transcends the need to decide issues of fact; and so his (or her) advantage over the appellate court transcends the conventional advantage of the fact-finder who has seen and heard the witnesses of fact. In a child case the judge develops a face-to-face, bench-to-witness-box, acquaintanceship with each of the candidates for the care of the child. Throughout their evidence his function is to ask himself not just "is this true?" or "is this sincere?" but "what does this evidence tell me about any future parenting of the child by this witness?" and, in a public law case, when always hoping to be able to answer his question negatively, to ask "are the local authority's concerns about the future parenting of the child by this witness justified?" The function demands a high degree of wisdom on the part of the family judge; focussed training; and the allowance to him by the justice system of time to reflect and to choose the optimum expression of the reasons for his decision. But the corollary is the difficulty of mounting a successful appeal against a judge's decision about the future arrangements for a child."</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The delivery of a judgment is not a transactional process. Its contents are not open to negotiation. Just as the trial is "not a dress rehearsal" but rather "the first and last night of the show" (per Lewison LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Fage UK Ltd v Chobani UK Ltd</span>, supra, at paragraph 114), so the judgment is not a draft paper for discussion but the definitive recording of the judge's decisions and the reasons for reaching them. It is therefore inappropriate to use a request for clarifications to reiterate submissions or re-argue the case, or to cite a part of the evidence not mentioned in the judgment and on the basis of that evidence ask the judge to reconsider the findings. In my view it is also inappropriate to couple a request for clarifications with a warning that an application for permission to appeal will be made if the clarification is not provided. I regret to say that this case provides examples of all of these inappropriate requests.&#8221;</p>

In cases where the parties are required to draw the order after judgment has been handed down, FPR r29.11(3)(a) requires the order to be filed &#8220;no later than 7 days after the date on which the court ordered or gave permission for the order to be drawn up so that it can be sealed by the court.&#8221; That gives an indication of the short timescale within which requests for clarification should be made. </p>

I do not regard the request for clarification of the judgment as to school holidays to have been appropriately made. As Baker LJ so clearly set out in YM, a judgment is not a transactional process.

He also made stated that he wanted a simple order in relation to holiday time because, in his view, the longer the order &#8220;the more the parties come back to court arguing it and the more it underlines the ongoing problems between the parties.&#8221; After a short break in the hearing after handing down, Counsel returned to court and Ms Gillman told the judge that the order was quite clear in relation to holiday time, namely that the parents are to come to agreement.

He had clearly decided not to dictate any arrangements beyond the equal division of time. The Judge was perfectly entitled therefore to refuse to give clarification of his judgment when asked &#8220;how the parents are to arrange time with the children on holidays&#8221; and &#8220;why there is no specificity to the orders made in particular around holiday agreements and arrangements.&#8221;  </p>

In fact, the request made was not exactly to that effect, asking only how the parents were to arrange time with the children on holidays and religious festivals. The Judge responded by saying he was making no order in relation to religious festivals but his response does not particularly assist the parties&#8217; or this court&#8217;s understanding of the reason why he made no order in relation to those special days beyond his expectation that the parents would themselves work it out.</p>

The Judge wrongly stated in his response to clarification that the issue had not been raised at the final hearing - it had been expressly referred to in the position statement on behalf of the Appellant by reference to detailed proposals in the Appellant&#8217;s witness statement &#8211; but that error does not by itself render the decision not to make a separate order wrong.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Judge took considerable care to evaluate the parents&#8217; evidence and their approaches to their communications, their relationship, and their parenting. As is very clear, he concluded that they had been incapable of working together in the interests of the children and he urged them to make changes to their own views and behaviour in order to find a way of working together. Some of the Judge&#8217;s comments made after the handing down of his judgment and in his written response to the request for clarification, suggest that he had a general dislike of defined &#8220;spend time with&#8221; orders and was refusing to make any further orders in relation to school holidays on that basis rather than applying his mind to what kind of order was suitable in this particular case. However, looking at the judgment overall, as well as his post judgment observations and clarification, I am satisfied that the Judge did apply his mind to the particular circumstances of this case and decided that it was not in the best interests of the children in this case to make any further order in relation to school holidays beyond the simple order that he made for an equal division of time on terms to be agreed. It is more difficult to reach that conclusion with reference to his decision to make no order in relation to religious festivals and other special days (all of which, for shorthand, I shall refer to as &#8220;special days&#8221;). However, taking his judgment and post judgment clarification as a whole, it seems to me that his evaluation of the parental dynamics led him to decide that it was better to make no order in relation to special days than to make any order.</p>

In some cases the court might consider that the best interests of the child are served by a tightly drawn, detailed order setting out defined arrangements, day by day, sometimes hour by hour. Such orders may dictate where the parents hand over the children, who should be present at handovers, who should take the children to school or pick them up, where a child will spend their birthday, or their parents&#8217; birthdays, and so on. In other cases, a much looser order might be suitable.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of course, it is precisely because separated parents cannot agree child arrangements that the vast majority of private law cases come before the court. If parents are capable of reaching agreement then, unless there is some other reason to do so, the court will not be asked to impose child arrangements. It does not follow that the court must always make a defined child arrangements order when the parents cannot agree arrangements for themselves. In each case the form of order has to be tailored to meet the best interests of the children depending on all the circumstances. No order will be made unless making an order will be better for the children. What is not acceptable is for the court to dismiss the option of making a defined or detailed child arrangements order in principle, or as a general rule, without considering the impact on the children&#8217;s welfare. Attempts to define child arrangements sometimes result in labyrinthine formulations. Understandably, this is exactly what the Judge wanted to avoid.  There is merit in simplicity and the court cannot, and should not try to, address every minute of the children&#8217;s lives or every practical arrangement. However, a defined order does not have to fall into that trap. The court can formulate orders that provide sufficient certainty and clarity without necessarily covering every possible eventuality. Some courts may be concerned that the less detail is included in a child arrangements order, the more opportunity there is for disagreement, uncertainty for the subject children, and further court applications. On the other hand, some courts might fear that the greater the detail within the order, the more there is for the parents to argue about and to challenge. That is the concern that the Judge expressed. In a case where the court assesses that one parent is pragmatic and reasonable and the other dogmatic and controlling about arrangements, then a different approach might be taken from a case in which reasonable parents disagree about a particular aspect of child arrangements but are capable of working together on other aspects in the interests of their children. The balance has to be struck in each case according to the court&#8217;s evaluation of the family dynamics and circumstances, always seeking to promote the best interests of the children.</p>

For example, adopting the approach that the Appellant had proposed at the final hearing, the Judge could have ordered that during school holidays the children shall together spend equal time with each parent on such dates and times as agreed by the parents in writing no later than six weeks before the commencement of the respective school holiday, and that in default of agreement by that time, the children shall spend alternate weeks during Winter and Easter holidays with each parent, and alternate fortnights during the Summer holidays. It is true that such an order would not meet every eventuality or issue that might arising during school holidays but the best interests of the children do not necessarily require an order to descend into minute detail. The family would have to come to agreements as to these additional details and issues as they arose. But they would know the essential arrangements in advance of the school holidays arriving.</p>

Those exhortations are sincere and I am sure that sometimes they have a positive effect. However, verbal encouragement alone will be unlikely to resolve parental hostility. In the present case it had been noted that the Respondent could not even make eye contact with the Appellant. The Judge noted that each parent&#8217;s view of the other was distorted by their own distrust or perceptions. He encouraged the parents to &#8220;work upon themselves and hope that it will lead to a more positive relationship&#8230;&#8221; but did not record any basis on which it could be safely assumed that they would do so or that the relationship would become more positive. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Where possible, and where, as here, there are no significant safeguarding concerns, the court should use its orders as a means of encouraging hostile parents to work together. To that extent, an over-defined order might be counter productive. If the order sets out every detail of the arrangements for them, then the parents have nothing to discuss. How will they then ever learn to work together in the best interests of their children? However, where the evidence establishes that it is unlikely that the parents will be able to agree the fundamental arrangements themselves, then an order that says little more than that they must do so is likely to result in further litigation. The court does have the power under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s91(14)</ref> to restrict further applications but it should not itself create circumstances likely to result in the need for further applications. It would be difficult to criticise either party for applying to the court for directions about arrangements for school holidays in default of agreement. Some arrangements would need to be made for the benefit of the children.</p>

With respect, I consider him wise not to do so. The Appellant&#8217;s proposals to the Judge in late January 2024 were not his preferred position - he had set that out in his witness statement - and were an attempt to provide a mechanism for resolving parental disputes about holiday time. But they were not attractive. The Appellant proposed that he and the Respondent should in turn govern the dates during school holidays in alternate years. This would be a recipe for each parent in turn to exercise control over the other. For alternate summer holidays one parent would dictate all the arrangements. Given relations between these parents, there would be a high risk of tit-for-tat arrangements year after year. Nor was the proposal focused on the children&#8217;s best interests. </p>

In his response to the request for clarification, however, he made it clear that he took a similar approach to the arrangements for school holidays: the parents were expected to come up with arrangements themselves. I accept that he did not provide separate reasoning for that determination, but his evaluation of the parents and his reasoning in respect to holiday time arrangements applied equally to his decision not to make a separate order in respect of special days. It would have been better had the Judge spelled out his decision and reasoning in respect of special days, but I am satisfied that having regard to the entirety of his judgment and clarification he did provide reasons for making no separate order.</p>

She noted the likelihood that the parents' communication would improve.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I am afraid that analysis is wrong in a number of ways. In the first place, the approach of HHJ Owens was the very opposite of how it is characterised. In no sense did she make the child arrangements order in a weak attempt at even-handedness. Nor did she make it because of the amendments to the Children Act in October 2014, which do not speak for equal shared care but provide that the court is to presume, unless the contrary is shown, that involvement of a parent in the life of a child will further the child's welfare (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1</ref>(2A)), but that this does not mean that there should be any particular division of a child's time (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1</ref>(2B)). Instead, Judge Owens made her order for the reasons that she gave and she should not have been castigated for doing so. Secondly, the last sentence in the above passage is plainly wrong as a matter of law and goes beyond the proper role of the appeal court, which is to review the decision under appeal, not to substitute the view of the appeal court for that of the judge who heard the evidence.&#8221;</p>

It is unfortunate that the Judge referred to the decision about whether to make a shared lives with order or a lives with/spend time with order as &#8220;label litigation&#8221;. In fact, he did allude to the possible advantages and disadvantages of the alternative orders, showing that he was aware that this was not merely a question of attaching a label. He referred to the impact of a lives with order on the balance of power within a parental relationship, which might be particularly important where one parent regards themselves as being in control. He referred to the impact of the order on the stability of the children. He referred to the possibility that the type of order made might make a difference to the &#8220;actions of either parent&#8221;. However, he did not apply those general observations to the case before him. The Judge did not give anything more than very brief reasons for electing to make a lives with/spend time with order. He concluded, &#8220;the reality of the lived experience of these children when looking at their welfare is that they continue to live with mother and spend time with father.&#8221; He held that in those circumstances &#8220;that is what should be reflected in the order.&#8221; That was the sole reasoning given. </p>

The Judge referred to the wishes and feelings of the children, saying that he did not accept that the children wanted to stay overnight on those Sundays. He did not record that they did not want to stay on Sunday nights but the Respondent directed me to the ISW&#8217;s notes which appear to record that R, at least, told the ISW she did not want to stay overnight on those Sundays. It is difficult to interpret all of the ISW&#8217;s handwritten notes in relation to the other children&#8217;s wishes and feelings about this issue. I agree with Mr Tyler KC that the structure of the Judge&#8217;s judgment meant that he determined this issue about overnight time with the Appellant without considering all the welfare checklist &#8211; he made a final determination of this discrete issue within his consideration of the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings before he then went on to consider the other elements of the checklist.</p>

Consideration of the other elements of the welfare checklist would have been very unlikely to have changed the Judge&#8217;s decision on this issue. This particular decision is of a kind routinely made in the Family Court and does not require a detailed analysis by the Judge. This Judge did give reasons for his decision and I have to consider the judgment as a whole. He did not want to disturb the arrangements during term time because he considered they were working well. He took into account the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings on this issue. Having regard to the legal tests on appeal, I do not regard this ground of appeal as having a real prospect of success or that there is a compelling reason why the appeal on this ground should be heard and I refuse the renewed application for permission to appeal.

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.13in">In the present case I am persuaded that the combination of orders, including the school holidays order and the lives with order in favour of the Respondent alone, resulted in child arrangements orders that gave much greater control to the Respondent than the Appellant. The question of removing the children from the jurisdiction is much more likely to arise during school holidays than in term time. Under the Judge&#8217;s order, the Respondent may take the children abroad without the Appellant&#8217;s agreement but the Appellant cannot do so without the Respondent&#8217;s agreement. This gives the Respondent more control over arrangements than the Appellant. Furthermore a lives with/spend time with order requires the Respondent to make sure the children spend time with the Appellant rather than requiring the parents together to divide the children&#8217;s time between them. She is the parent who has to take steps to make the order work. She is put in the driving seat.</p>

However, as set out above, the child arrangements order he made was likely to embed the notion that the Respondent was in charge when making arrangements for the children. Indeed the post-hearing correspondence underlines that risk. A shared lives with order would encourage the parents to work together on an equal footing rather than the Respondent being in the driving seat. Far from creating &#8220;chaos&#8221; as the Respondent submitted, a shared lives with order would regularise their equal standing in relation to each other which would be more conducive to working relations. The Appellant would not feel that he was regarded in any way as inferior as a parent. The Respondent would not feel that she was regarded in any way superior as a parent. This would be beneficial to their discussions about child arrangements.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Standing back and again reminding myself of the law applicable to the appellate jurisdiction, I regret that I am driven to conclude that the Judge was wrong not to direct any defined arrangements for the children to spend time equally with each parent during school holidays in the event that the parents could not agree arrangements. That part of the child arrangements order was, on the Judge&#8217;s own findings, likely to fail leading to uncertainty for the children, further parental animosity, and further litigation. A defined default arrangement need not have been complex. The holiday arrangements were particularly important to these children who were used to going abroad and seeing family abroad during the school holidays. I am acutely mindful that an appellate court should not lightly interfere with such an order and have considered very carefully whether it was open to the Judge to make the order that he did. I have concluded that having found that the parents cannot work together in the interests of the children, it was irrational to leave the parents to agree the equal time holiday arrangements without any default provision. The order made was outwith the range of orders that the Judge could reasonably have made in this case and on the findings and evaluation that he had made. In my judgment the Judge was wrong and I allow the appeal under ground 1.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Judge decided to make no order in relation to arrangements during religious holidays and did not make any order for arrangements for other special days. He did not give adequate reasons for making no such orders but, after some hesitation, I have concluded that the Judge was entitled to conclude that no separate orders were required or appropriate. Having found that the Judge should have provided a default position for school holidays I have to explain why I find he was entitled not to provide a default position for special days. Primarily, it is because there would be a default position even without a specific order dealing with special days. Once term time arrangements are defined, as was the case, and holiday arrangements are either agreed or resort to a default defined order, then special days fall within those arrangements. If a birthday falls on a day when the child is to spend time with the Appellant, then that is the arrangement. The children will spend days during Eid with whichever parent they are due to be living with or spending time with on those days. By alternating the first week of each holiday period annually as being with the Respondent and then the Appellant, Christmas (which the family does not in any event celebrate as a religious festival) and Easter, and other religious festivals and birthdays during school holidays, will be likely to fall sometimes during time with the Appellant, and sometimes during the time with the Respondent. A complex set of defined arrangements for religious festivals and other special days could be devised but it would not necessarily be better for the children to do so. The Judge was entitled to leave such special days where they lay and not to make a separate or further defined order. The Judge was entitled to decline to make any separate order in this regard and I refuse ground 2 of the Grounds of Appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have considered the effect of the orders as a whole, but even if the school holiday order were to have included a defined default arrangement, as I have found it ought to have done, I have concluded that the Judge was also wrong to have made a lives with/spend time with order rather than a shared lives with order. The Judge had indicated that he did not want either parent to feel in control of making the child arrangements. He knew that travel abroad was important for this family. He knew that there had been allegations and counter-allegations by the parents about the exercise of control. The unequal division of time spent by the children with each parent did not, in this case, mean that one parent was any less important to them than the other, as a parent. The Judge did not identify any factor that weighed against making a shared lives with order. The only reason he gave for making a lives with/spend time with order was that it reflected the children&#8217;s experience. I am not sure that it did so: the fact that the children spent less time with the Appellant than the Respondent did not mean that they did not regard themselves as living with him when they were with him. But, in any event, the Judge was changing the arrangements and therefore the children&#8217;s experience.</p>

He did not give adequate reasons for his choice of order. He failed to consider the impact on these children&#8217;s welfare of the alternatives of a lives with/spend time with order or a shared lives with order. For the reasons I have set out at sub-paragraphs 86 (viii) to (xv) of this judgment, had he done so he could only rationally have decided to make a shared lives with order. Accordingly, the order lives with/spend time with order he made was outwith the range of orders he could reasonably have made. For those reasons I allow the appeal under ground 4.</p>
