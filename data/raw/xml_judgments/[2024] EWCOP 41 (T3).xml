	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Prior to PQ turning 18  there were concerns in relation to her vulnerability to sexual exploitation and risks associated with social media use. She was very trusting and quick to strike up relationships without the ability to recognise and manage risks. One man was arrested for grooming after contact with PQ via social media when she was aged 15. PQ was living with a relative, RS the Second Respondent, with whom she had what was in effect a mother/daughter relationship. That relationship was under strain when PQ turned 18. PQ then developed a relationship with a man about ten years her senior. Evidence came to light of arguments, controlling behaviour, and violence within the relationship. PQ revealed to a teacher that she and the man were having unprotected intercourse. In late 2018, RS refused to have her back in the house and insisted that alternative accommodation be found for PQ. A hurried mental capacity assessment concluded that PQ lacked capacity to make decisions about residence, care, contact with others and engagement in sexual relations. The Local Authority brought proceedings within the Court of Protection seeking best interest decisions to place PQ into residential care and to manage her contact with others.</p>

PQ is in receipt of 14 hours of 1:1 support each day. The Local Authority and Official Solicitor agree that the arrangements which amount to a deprivation of PQ&#8217;s liberty are in her best interests.  HHJ Smith recorded in January 2024 that PQ was happy in her placement. An attendance note from January 2024 records that PQ considered that it was best for her that the deprivation of liberty was authorised because it kept her safe.</p>

Her detention has been and continues to be authorised by the Court in these proceedings and is therefore in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law. There is no issue arising in relation to Art 5(1). As for Art 5(4), although the proceedings have taken several years to reach the present point, the Court has carefully but speedily considered interim declarations and orders during the proceedings and no issue is taken as to the effective exercise by PQ of her entitlement to take proceedings to challenge the lawfulness of her detention to date. The issue is whether future arrangements, in particular those during the review period, will comply with Art 5(4).

In their submission, Mr. Winterwerp had ample opportunity, especially during his various periods of leave from the hospital, to consult a lawyer of his own choosing. Since he apparently never elected to apply to the courts through a lawyer either at the moment of the periodic review of his confinement or as regards his requests for release, it cannot be said, so the Government argue, that he has been refused his right "to take proceedings" as guaranteed by Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).</p>

Having "substantial and well-founded grounds for denying the lawfulness of [the] detention" cannot be a pre-condition for access to the proceedings contemplated by Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4), since this is precisely the issue that the domestic court should decide. Furthermore, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) does not require that persons committed to care under the head of "unsound mind" should themselves take the initiative in obtaining legal representation before having recourse to a court.</p>

Special procedural safeguards may prove called for in order to protect the interests of persons who, on account of their mental disabilities, are not fully capable of acting for themselves (see <span style="font-style:italic">Megyeri v.

It is not within the province of the Court to inquire into what would be the best or most appropriate system of judicial review in this sphere. However, in the present case the courts were not involved in deciding on the applicant&#8217;s placement in the K&#279;dainiai Home at any moment or in any form. It appears that, in situations such as the applicant&#8217;s, Lithuanian law does not provide for automatic judicial review of the lawfulness of admitting a person to and keeping him in an institution like the K&#279;dainiai Home. In addition, a review cannot be initiated by the person concerned if that person has been deprived of his legal capacity. In sum, the applicant was prevented from independently pursuing any legal remedy of a judicial character to challenge her continued involuntary institutionalisation.</p>

The Court also observes that the applicant&#8217;s current legal guardian is the K&#279;dainiai Home &#8211; the same social care institution, which is responsible for her treatment and, furthermore, the same institution which the applicant had complained against on many occasions, including in court proceedings. In this context the Court considers that where a person capable of expressing a view, despite having been deprived of legal capacity, is deprived of his liberty at the request of his guardian, he must be accorded an opportunity of contesting that confinement before a court, with separate legal representation...&#8221;</p>

As Mr Crabtree put it, no matter what internal review structure is put in place, evidence of any significant change must of itself prompt speedy consideration of the need for calling an early internal review.

But he submits that internal reviews need not involve further full assessments from the independent experts unless there is reason to believe that there has been a change either in the person's capacity or in what his best interests require.

He considered that the appointment of a professional representative would meet those requirements. Charles J noted that in NRA he had found that whilst the pool of professional IMCAs, RPRs, and Care Act advocates would in principle provide an ideal source of professional representatives, usually available through providers contracted to Local Authorities, in practice that pool was very restricted and would not meet the needs for representatives for Ps under community DOLs.

The solution of using COP Visitors has not, so far as I am aware, taken hold.

I am not aware of reported cases  after <span style="font-style:italic">KT</span> in which the process there set out has been adopted. On the other hand I am not aware of there being hundreds of stayed cases. I presume therefore that in most cases, albeit not in the present case, a pragmatic solution has been found.

She did not hold that it could never be appropriate. Ms Kelly submitted that the Strasbourg cases did not establish that a minimum requirement for compliance with Article 5(4) was the appointment of a representative during a review period nor that there was a continuing, unlimited, entitlement to challenge the deprivation of liberty before a Judge. A balance had to be struck in each case. Here, the Court has taken great pains to assess capacity and best interests. The judicially authorised deprivation of liberty will be reviewed by the Court within 12 months or such different period as the Court shall deem fit and, in standard form, the Court will order that during the review period the Local Authority will have an ongoing obligation to apply to the Court if there is a change to the care plan rendering it more restrictive. She submitted that it was not appropriate for the Court now to determine whether at the end of the review period, the review should be conducted orally. Instead, it should be left for the Local Authority to decide in the circumstances that then prevail, whether to use the streamlined procedure. Either a party will apply for an oral hearing or the Court will itself decide whether an oral hearing is required, but only depending on the circumstances as they are at that time. </p>

He accepted that he could not point to authority from the ECtHR to the effect that P must have a representative within the review period, but contended that the appointment of a representative should be regarded as a necessary minimum requirement for compliance with art 5 in PQ&#8217;s case and that it was irrelevant that she was deprived of her liberty in the community rather than in a hospital or care home. Indeed, there may be less oversight in the community where, for example, there is no care home manager. The need for an independent representative might be all the greater where there is a DOL in the community. Without a representative, PQ&#8217;s rights would be &#8220;theoretical and illusory&#8221; not &#8220;practical and effective&#8221; &#8211; see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Airey v Ireland </span>Application no. 6289/73 9 October 1979 at [24].

When P has been a party during proceedings to determine their capacity or best interests, it does not necessarily follow that they must remain a party. It is now established (<span style="font-style:italic">NRA</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re JM</span>) that compliance with Art 5 does not require P to be a party to the proceedings. P may be discharged as a party and therefore their Litigation Friend may properly be discharged. However, whilst it is not necessary for P to retain party status, that is one of the options to secure their participation that the Court should consider. COP Rules 2017 r1.2 requires the Court to consider whether it should make one or more directions for the participation of P, including making P a party, appointing an ALR, or appointing a representative.

However, an RPR is mandatory for the review period even if a s21A challenge to a Schedule A1 deprivation of liberty has been determined by the Court. In such cases an RPR is mandatory even after judicial scrutiny and approval of a deprivation of liberty.</p>

As a matter of logic, the support for P during a DoLS review period, including the mandatory provision of an RPR, is not necessarily set at the minimum level for compliance with Art 5(4).  The provision of an RPR might be regarded as going beyond the minimum requirements for compliance with Art 5(4).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Where there is a suitable and available r1.2 representative, then in many community DOL cases it will be appropriate to appoint them for the review period. If there is a family member or friend who is suitable and willing to act then, as Charles J found in <span style="font-style:italic">NRA</span> and the subsequent cases, they will be able to fulfil the role and their appointment will satisfy the Court that Art 5 will be complied with. If no family member or friend can act, then a professional r1.2 representative could likewise fulfil the role and the procedural safeguards under Art 5 will be satisfied. Rule 1.2 representatives are able to carry out functions similar to those of an RPR and they will give the Court reassurance that someone is fighting P&#8217;s corner throughout the review period and prior to the planned judicial scrutiny of the deprivation of P&#8217;s liberty at the end of the review period. Charles J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re JM</span> held that the appointment of a representative would ensure compliance with the requirements of Art 5 and I respectfully agree.  I am sure that this is why Senior Judge Hilder recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">Bolton Council v KL</span> (above) that &#8220;the Court will be unlikely to discharge P as a party or the appointment of the Litigation Friend unless there is an agreed person willing and suitable to be appointed as Rule 1.2 representative for P during the review period&#8221;.

In principle, having regard to the matters to be considered under COPR r1.2(1), the Court might discharge P without appointing a representative if satisfied that there is no prospect of any contentious matters arising in the review period and that there will be sufficient monitoring and sufficient opportunity for P to raise concerns or to make challenges pending the planned review. Such circumstances are likely to be rare but to the extent that Charles J held in <span style="font-style:italic">Re JM</span> that it could never be Art 5 compliant for P as a non-party to have no representative when deprived of their liberty, I respectfully disagree. However, in most cases the Court will not be satisfied that P can participate without either being a party with a Litigation Friend or ALR, or as proceeding as a non-party with an ALR or a r1.2 representative. </p>

The ECtHR has held that access to judicial review of the deprivation of P&#8217;s liberty should not depend on the goodwill of the detaining authority &#8211; <span style="font-style:italic">Raudevs </span>(above). Thus it is not sufficient to rely on the Local Authority itself to challenge the care and other arrangements it is implementing. Both Munby J and Charles J in the judgments cited above emphasised the need for an independent representative. The representative might be funded by the detaining authority and/or work for a provider under contract with the detaining authority but their role must be to act independently and in the best interests of P. </p>

PQ&#8217;s participation in decision making affecting her requires to be considered for the whole of the review period, not just the last month or so when preparations for the planned review are underway. If she remains a party she will require the services of a Litigation Friend. She cannot act as a party without a Litigation Friend because she does not have capacity to conduct the litigation herself. The Litigation Friend will be able effectively to fulfil a role similar to that of an RPR under the DoLS regime. If PQ is discharged as a party, then unless she has an ALR or r1.2 representative, the Court will have to rely on other mechanisms for reassurance that her Art 5(4) rights will be upheld. By the usual Court orders made when authorising the deprivation of a person&#8217;s liberty, the Local Authority will itself be bound to apply to the Court in the event of significant changes in care arrangements rendering them more restrictive. The Court could make additional directions requiring the Local Authority to restore the matter to Court in the event of any evidence of a change in capacity. However these protections will all rely on the detaining authority to act and PQ would not have an independent person acting as her eyes and ears during the review period.</p>

Under s67 of that Act the Local Authority would be obliged to appoint an independent advocate for PQ, due to her incapacity, when it was required to involve PQ in the exercise of a relevant function. Those functions primarily concern the preparation and revision of assessments and care and support plans. Similar provisions require the appointment of an advocate for the purposes of a safeguarding enquiry or review (s68). However, there is no particular expectation that such an obligation under either s67 or s68 would arise during the review period in PQ&#8217;s case, let alone a guarantee of the involvement of an independent Care Act advocate, and the role of such an advocate would be specific to the relevant function and would not extend to a continuing oversight of the deprivation of PQ&#8217;s liberty.</p>

Can the Court rely on the standard directions such as those set out above following streamlined proceedings which include requirements to restore the case to Court if there is a significant change in circumstances rendering the care plan more restrictive?  The Court could add requirements such as that a placement visit by a social worker is made and reported upon at least once a month, or that PQ is notified by a specified person of her right to challenge the arrangements and to seek advice or assistance (COPR Part 7). The difficulty with such arrangements, in the absence of an independent representative, is that there would be no independent oversight during the review period and all responsibility would fall on the detaining authority. Access to the Court should not depend on the goodwill of the detaining authority &#8211; <span style="font-style:italic">Raudevs </span>(above). Furthermore, the support for PQ would be reactive not pro-active. No independent person would be actively carrying out the functions of a representative to monitor, raise concerns that the Local Authority might not perceive, and if necessary initiate a challenge to the Local Authority. I have had careful regard to the particular circumstances of this case and in my judgement, without an independent representative acting for PQ during the review period, her Art 5(4) rights would be breached. Her continued effective participation requires some form of independent representation during the forthcoming review period, be it through a Litigation Friend, an ALR, or a r1.2 representative.</p>

The likely need for representation for a P who is deprived of their liberty has been recognised not only in relation to the planned review of their deprivation of liberty but also during the whole of the review period. My conclusion also sits comfortably alongside the mandatory requirement for P to have a representative when deprived of their liberty in a hospital or care home under the DoLS regime. In the present case, without some form of independent representation, PQ&#8217;s Art 5 rights would be &#8220;theoretical and illusory&#8221; not &#8220;practical and effective&#8221;.</p>

Charles J&#8217;s view was that it was for central government to fund representation but, several years on from the test cases which Charles J had to consider, it cannot be right to put PQ&#8217;s case or similar cases on hold with no prospect of central or local government providing a solution. Delay should be avoided if possible. PQ is to be deprived of her liberty in her best interests and a practical solution is required to ensure (i) that her best interests are met and (ii) that the procedural safeguards which should be guaranteed under Art 5(4) are in place.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unfortunately, the Court cannot appoint a lay r1.2 representative in this case because none is available. Likewise, the Local Authority will not pay for a professional representative, be they an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (&#8220;IMCA&#8221;), an RPR, or a Care Act Advocate acting as a r1.2 representative, and the Court does not have the power to order the Local Authority to fund a representative. I have considered whether I should refuse to authorise the deprivation of liberty unless or until a r1.2 representative is in place, but Ms Kelly has warned the Court against taking such a course. She cites <span style="font-style:italic">Re PQ</span> [2015] EWCA Civ 411, in which the Court of Appeal noted that while the family courts and Court of Protection may seek to &#8216;persuade&#8217; public authorities to act in a way that it considers to be in a child or adult&#8217;s best interests, it must not use exercise its powers in a way to &#8216;pressure&#8217; a public body &#8216;to allocate its resources in a particular way,&#8217; [27] and &#8216;Rigorous probing, searching questions and persuasion are permissible; pressure is not.&#8217; [36]. I heed that warning and approach the present case as one in which the Court must strive to find a solution in PQ&#8217;s best interests.</p>

However, I understand from the Local Authority that the timescales for reports from Visitors can be well over one year, which renders the use of a Visitor for the present purposes impractical. Furthermore, the Office of the Public Guardian has advised the parties that Visitors are not known to have been used for the purposes for which a representative would be required in PQ&#8217;s case. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">No reviewable decision has been made by the LAA and I am not asked to consider the legality of the LAA withdrawing funding for PQ&#8217;s representation during the review period when proceedings become &#8220;dormant&#8221; but the care arrangements and deprivation of liberty require monitoring and there may be a need to raise concerns or even mount legal challenges on her behalf. The LAA has not said that it would withdraw funding. I have evidence only of a caseworker advising that the LAA would &#8220;not keep a certificate open indefinitely&#8221;, which is not something they would be invited to do &#8211; the review period would be for twelve months with further consideration at that stage as to how PQ should participate: there would not be an indefinite need for the Official Solicitor to act as Litigation Friend. However, I do have to contemplate the possibility that the LAA might withdraw funding for PQ&#8217;s representation following the making of &#8220;final&#8221; orders and declarations. I also understand that, in any event, non-means tested legal aid is not available and so there will remain a possibility that funding could be withdrawn on the grounds of PQ&#8217;s means. The Official Solicitor requires security for costs as one of the criteria for her appointment. It is possible therefore that at some point during the review period, the Official Solicitor would have to cease to act.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Similarly, public funding would be required for an ALR. In principle, an ALR may be appointed whether P continues as a party or is discharged as a party. The appointment of an ALR does not automatically bring funding with it. Although the LAA has not been asked about funding an ALR, I understand that funding would be subject to the merits test and be means tested. The Law Society&#8217;s online guidance states, &#8220;Where P has been joined as a party <span style="font-style:italic">and an oral hearing has, or is likely to be listed,</span> legal aid [to fund an ALR] is likely to be available to meet P&#8217;s legal costs on a means-tested basis&#8221; [emphasis added]. However, in the present case I am not prepared to direct that the review hearing in 12 months&#8217; time must be an oral hearing, or to direct that earlier or more frequent oral hearings should be listed, simply as a device to secure LAA funding either for the Official Solicitor as Litigation Friend, or for an ALR. The Court of Protection should not be burdened with otherwise unnecessary hearings. Whether the 12 month review will require an oral hearing will depend on the circumstances as they are at the relevant time. I have not been provided with evidence as to the comparative costs of funding a newly appointed ALR and of continuing to fund the Official Solicitor as Litigation Friend, and an instructed solicitor.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not know how many other community DOL cases have circumstances similar to those in this case and I have reached my conclusions on the basis of the facts and circumstances of this case alone. Taking all matters into consideration, having determined that PQ&#8217;s participation requires either the continued role of a Litigation Friend or the appointment of a representative, each being independent of the detaining authority, and there being no option to appoint a r1.2 representative, I shall direct that P shall continue to be a party and that the Official Solicitor shall continue to act as Litigation Friend until further order. Were an ALR appointed in place of the Official Solicitor acting as Litigation Friend, and were the duties of the ALR to include monitoring the arrangements during the review period and raising challenges and making applications as appropriate, then I would be satisfied that the appointment of an ALR would meet the requirements of Article 5 for the purposes of the review period. However, the Official Solicitor is already in place. I do not have evidence that the costs of maintaining the Official Solicitor as Litigation Friend will be disproportionate or indeed that they will be higher than the costs of appointing and then funding an ALR. I would consider authorising the appointment of a suitable ALR on application if assured that funding were secured and that it would be proportionate to make the appointment and to discharge the Official Solicitor as Litigation Friend but, for now at least, I shall direct that the Official Solicitor shall continue to act as Litigation Friend for PQ.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Directions for P&#8217;s continued participation shall be re-considered at the review hearing or, if earlier, any hearing in the proceedings on application. During the dormant period of the proceedings in the review period, the Official Solicitor as Litigation Friend must ensure that PQ has representation to fulfil a role similar to that of an RPR under the DoLS scheme or that of a r1.2 representative. The representative  must  monitor the implementation of the Care Plan, provide to the Court updating information on the implementation of the Care Plan ahead of the review hearing as provided for in the order which the Court will make, and must make an earlier application for review of the Court&#8217;s order if they consider that the Care Plan no longer serves the best interests of PQ and that an application is required. The litigation is ongoing albeit there may be no active applications before the Court prior to the end of the review period. As Litigation Friend, the Official Solicitor will (continue to) instruct a solicitor to act for PQ. The functions I have outlined may be fulfilled by a solicitor but perhaps the solicitor could engage another kind of professional to carry out those functions insofar as they do not involve making or responding to court applications. For example, a professional RPR might be a suitable person for the purpose of monitoring the care arrangements, care plans, and the deprivation of PQ&#8217;s liberty.</p>

These functions are important and they are connected with ongoing proceedings. There is no alternative form of representation available. There may be a need for future oral hearings but that cannot be known in advance. The very purpose of representation would be to ensure that the need for an oral hearing during the review period was swiftly identified and appropriate applications to Court were made.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The outcome is unsatisfactory because, although important, the functions that a solicitor instructed by the Official Solicitor will be performing during the review period could as well be performed by a r1.2 representative. I have not been provided with comparative costs but presume that the cost of a r1.2 representative would be less than the cost of retaining a solicitor instructed by the Official Solicitor or an ALR. The costs will fall on the LAA rather than the Local Authority. There is therefore an incentive on Local Authorities to refuse to fund r1.2 representatives if they know that the LAA will fund an ALR or a solicitor instructed by the Official Solicitor. Charles J referred to these &#8220;budgetary battles&#8221; and sadly they are continuing eight years after his plea for a resolution. In the end, the state pays and the solution to which I have been compelled to arrive means that the state will probably pay more than it should pay. The Official Solicitor has not asked the Court to consider the wider ramifications for the allocation of limited resources, but the potential ramifications are plain for all to see. The solution, which lies in the hands of the state through central government and Local Authorities, is to fund a professional r1.2 representative. The failure to do so results in a solution in this case that probably imposes a higher burden on  the taxpayer. However, I cannot countenance the alternative of leaving PQ with no independent representation of any kind during the review period because that would not comply with the minimum requirements of Art 5.</p>

The Court will have to cross that bridge as and when it has to, but I would hope and expect that the Local Authority would then approve funding for a professional r1.2 representative because otherwise PQ&#8217;s continued detention <span style="font-style:italic">by the Local Authority</span> would, on my findings, be likely to contravene Art 5(4) of the ECHR. The Court itself is not equipped to substitute the function of a representative during a review period and the only form of representation that could be made available would be a professional r1.2 representative. Ms Kelly has properly warned the Court against seeking to compel a Local Authority to fund a representative, but I do raise the question of how the Court could properly authorise a deprivation of liberty knowing that during the review period there would be no compliance with Art 5(4).</p>
