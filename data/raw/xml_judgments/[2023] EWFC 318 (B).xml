However, at the beginning of this year, matters came to a head and the Local Authority issued these current proceedings and sought removal of Leah from her parents&#8217; care. Leah  was initially placed with her paternal uncle and aunt but sadly, they decided that they were not in a position to care for Leah  in the long term and Leah  was moved to an alternative carer, who fortunately was somebody that was known to Leah . That move took place at the beginning of November.</span></p>

Those identify the longstanding nature of Karen&#8217;s difficulties. It seems that many of her problems stem from her own childhood. Her drug and alcohol use has resulted in her being unable to maintain suitable home conditions, either for herself but more particularly for Leah .</span></p>

Because of Karen&#8217;s problems with drugs and alcohol, it meant that Leah  was exposed to her mother&#8217;s own erratic behaviour and there were occasions when her mother shouted at professionals and became involved in altercations with other family members.  </span>A further concern in was that she was allowing Leah  to be cared for by family members who were deemed unsuitable to care.</p>

A concern that has arisen perhaps more latterly during the course of these proceedings and the assessments of Leah is that Leah herself may now be suffering from foetal alcohol syndrome.

It is perhaps an indication of some of the difficulties she has in managing her life that she arrived very late for what was supposed to be a 10.30 hearing, arriving not until after 11.00am. She tells me, and I accept, that there were problems with the trains and with transport generally, but again, I think her very late arrival is an indication that her life remains chaotic.</span></p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="color:#000000">To her absolute credit, she has accepted today that she is not in a position to care for Leah  because she accepts that she still has some reliance on cannabis and on alcohol. Whilst she says that that is much reduced, and she has indeed been engaging with Aspire, who have been working with her to address her problems, she has not been able to achieve abstinence.</span></p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="color:#000000">For a mother with such a longstanding history in relation to drugs and alcohol, and a woman for whom the impact of her usage is clear from the papers, it seems to me that she does need to achieve abstinence in order for anybody to have confidence that she could resume care of Leah  and meet Leah &#8217;s needs. Her aspiration is to be able to be a social drinker. I agree with the Guardian that that is perhaps an unrealistic aspiration at this stage against such a long history of problems.</span></p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="color:#000000">Whilst accepting that she is not in a position to care for Leah  today,  Karen would invite me to make a Care Order rather than approving the Local Authority&#8217;s application for a Placement Order. She says that Leah  should remain in long term foster care, which would enable her to maintain the relationship that she has not only with her mother, which I accept entirely is a very positive relationship when the mother is in attendance and when the mother is well, but also with her older siblings, (despite a significant age gap between Leah  and her siblings). Those are all valid and important points and points that I have taken into account.</span></p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="color:#000000">The threshold criteria was agreed at the last hearing and forms part of my bundle and effectively reflects the interim threshold criteria. Again, it is to Karen&#8217;s credit that she has accepted the problems that she has had and the way in which those have impacted upon her lifestyle and upon her care of Leah. The fact that the threshold criteria are crossed does not automatically lead to the making of the orders that the Local Authority seek, it is simply a gateway and enables me to make public law orders should I feel that those are consistent with Leah &#8217;s welfare.</span></p>

Sadly, I am drawn to the conclusion which Karen accepts, that unless and until she is able to address her own difficulties, it is very hard to see how professional support could enable her to care for Leah  in a safe way.</span></p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="color:#000000">When looking at a plan of adoption, I remind myself that adoption is and must be seen as a very last resort, it is an order that should only be approved if nothing else will do. Children should be brought up by their birth families whenever possible unless it is unsafe for them to do so. Any interference by the state must be proportionate to the needs of the child and the welfare interests of the child, the making of a Placement Order is the most significant interference that a court can impose upon family life.</span></p>

Those matters are indicative of her ongoing problems and in no way reflect upon her love for Leah.  I entirely accept how much she loves Leah  and how much she would dearly wish to care for her.</span></p>

I have no doubt she would be much loved in her mother&#8217;s care but would be placed at further risk of neglect of her needs and exposure to her mother&#8217;s drug and alcohol use. </span></p>

That is understandable, she has only recently taken on her care. That, as the Guardian points out, reflects the nature of foster care and the fact that foster care is seen as a short term commitment. Even placements that are identified as long term foster placements can and do come to an end, sometimes very abruptly when the circumstances of the foster carers change unexpectedly.</span></p>

However, foster care does have the advantage of enabling Leah  to maintain relationships with her birth family and to remain a member of her birth family, and I recognise those as important and significant matters.</span></p>

She will not have ongoing social work visits, she will not have restrictions on her life as a foster child would. However, she would cease to be a member of her birth family and the Local Authority plan would mean that her contact would become indirect only with her birth family. Those are important matters to consider.</span></p>

I take into account Leah &#8217;s age and the fact that her birth family are well known to her. She is a little girl who, on what I read, knows her own mind and is quite forceful in expressing it. She knows who her mum is, she knows who her dad is and she knows who her siblings are.</span></p>

For the reasons I have set out, placement with Karen was always going to be difficult and Karen herself accepts that she is not really in a position to care for Leah  at this time but it may be that her position will change in the future. However, I say now that given her very longstanding problems, I think for any professionals and for this Court to have confidence in her ability to maintain sobriety and meet Leah &#8217;s needs in the longer term, I would need to see a very different picture from the mother, one in which she had achieved abstinence and maintained abstinence for a good period of time. She is far from that at the moment.</span></p>

Whilst I do not make it a condition of any order I make today, I think it is important that it is explored and the option of Leah  being able to maintain some form of relationship with her mother is given very careful consideration by any prospective adopters.</span></p>

I think it is something worth exploring and my understanding is that adopters coming into adoption now come with an expectation that face to face contact must be considered and can often offer children a real sense of the family they have come from and where they fit in the world in general.</span></p>
