However, more recent medical opinion on the cause of the injuries, centred to some extent on pathological analysis of a segment of the baby boy&#8217;s skull (which had, to all intents and purposes, been lost at the time of my earlier hearing), provide proper grounds on which this court should review its earlier conclusions.</p>

He was unconscious (registering 3 on the Glasgow Coma Scale &#8211; the lowest reading, indicating deep unconsciousness), moribund, and for a time immediately prior to the arrival of the emergency services had in fact stopped breathing.  On investigation he was found to have a fractured skull, a subdural haemorrhage, and multiple fractured spinal vertebrae.  He was transferred immediately to Great Ormond Street Hospital where he underwent surgery on the morning of 24 October for the release of pressure on his brain; his condition was stabilised, and after a period of recuperation, in early December 2012, he was discharged to the care of his grandparents.  AD has been left permanently damaged by the injuries.</p>

A welfare hearing followed in March 2014.  In determining the futures of AD and his sister, I received social work analysis, a helpful report from the Children&#8217;s Guardian, and a comprehensive risk assessment from Dr. Cleo Van Velsen, Consultant Psychiatrist in Forensic Psychotherapy; at the conclusion of the welfare hearing (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re AD &amp; AM (Non-Accidental Injury: Welfare)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/4899" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 4899 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 4899 (Fam)</ref>), I endorsed the Local Authority&#8217;s plan to rehabilitate AD and AM to the care of their parents, subject to a tightly drawn agreement between the family and the Local Authority, constant supervision of the mother&#8217;s care of the two children by family members, a shared residence order between the parents and the paternal grandmother, and a supervision order.  I made plain that I contemplated that I considered it likely that the Local Authority would seek the renewal of the supervision order in early 2015. </p>

Atkinson at the East London Family Court), the mother cross-applied for a re-hearing of the findings of fact.  In short, she asserted that evidence which had been obtained from reputable medical experts in the criminal proceedings cast doubt upon the findings which I had made in July 2013.  </p>

The mother and father were both born in Nigeria, and are from the same area of that country; they were married there in 2008.  They are professional people; the grandparents on both sides have professional backgrounds, the paternal grandfather being a professor of pharmacology.  AD was born on 7 January 2012.  He was breast and bottle fed, dietary supplement being offered by infant &#8216;formula&#8217;.  The parents report that when only a month or so old, AD suffered &#8220;extreme colic&#8221;.  When AD was only a few weeks old, question arose as to whether he may be vitamin D deficient.  It was only when the mother subsequently arranged for her own vitamin D levels to be tested, that this revealed an abnormally low level. What is known is that by May 2012 AD was believed to have attained appropriate levels of vitamin D &#8211; the test in May 2012 shows normal levels of alkaline phosphatase (the only abnormal test being his haemoglobin levels).</p>

He said that he noticed that a toy sit-on cart/scooter had moved; AD was lying close to the bed on his right hand side (facing away from the door), with his head about 12 to 15 inches from the table leg of the television table.  AM (who had been sitting on the bed) was standing by the door.  AD cried, the father said for &#8220;a few minutes&#8221;.  The father said that he picked AD up, and carried him straight away downstairs; having left the bedroom he went downstairs without delay (AM following) and &#8220;by the time we were in the kitchen, he was not crying as loud; the crying stopped shortly after we got outside&#8221;.  On this description I concluded that the crying was not likely to have lasted longer than 5-6 minutes.  </p>

Dr. Cartlidge did not accept this: &#8220;this is getting nowhere near the 2&#8217; free fall which is the minimum; most clinicians would suggest 3&#8217;&#8221;; he observed fairly that AD would not be 2&#8217; tall, and a fall would not be a &#8216;free fall&#8217;.

Even if &#8216;insufficient&#8217; or &#8216;deficient&#8217;, I accept Professor Nussey&#8217;s evidence that it was not of such a magnitude as to have played a significant role in bone fragility predisposing [AD] to any of the fractures (including the vertebral fractures).  It is clear from the evidence which I have heard and read that [AD] did not have rickets.  I therefore find that there was no medical condition predisposing [AD] to fracture.  The degree of force required to inflict these serious injuries is therefore of the degree postulated (i.e. significant force) by those who have expressed an opinion about it in these proceedings.&#8221;</p>

I should point out, in fairness to Professor Malcolm, that it now transpires that he had ceased taking medico-legal work in April 2012, and no one from Great Ormond Street Hospital had apparently contacted him either to clarify that he could perform the task, or with instructions more generally.

Woven bones, she explains, is a feature which may suggest vitamin D deficiency, and/or osteopenia; she considers it &#8220;anatomically plausible&#8221; that the fractured bones may have torn the dura in order to cause the subdural haemorrhage.   Dr. Watt has commented on these new discoveries and identifies the presence of some radiographic features of a mild degree of osteopenia, which in the absence of any prior identified medical condition, is &#8220;very unusual in a child of this age&#8221;; he observes that signs of osteopenia have not, however, revealed themselves subsequently.</p>

To be clear, for a normal healthy child of this size tipping over from a seated position onto a flat firm surface I do not know of any scientific data that suggests that a skull fracture of this magnitude could occur. If however, the head impact surface presented an edge or some other localised feature, if [AD] had pre-existing bone abnormalities make skull weaker, and/or if [AD]&#8217;s sister interacted with [AD] lowering the head impact scenario then the biomechanical data is much less clear and this may very well represent a reasonable injury scenario explaining [AD]&#8217;s head injury.&#8221;</p>

Mr. Tughan countered this invitation by submitting that the problems with Dr. Hyman&#8217;s report were as much an issue of substance as of style; Mr. Tughan made what appears to me to be the legitimate point that in expressing his views, Dr. Hyman may well have trespassed across a number of expert disciplines outside his own; there is reason to observe indeed that his report encroaches fairly substantially into judicial territory.

The inconsistencies and contradictions between some of the reports further reduce their evidential value (see [71](iv) above).  The contributions are inherently the weaker for that.  Mr. Storey wisely did not pursue his case that &#8216;question marks&#8217; hang over Dr. Fairhurst (see [43] (v) above). My own enquiry of the GMC reveals no record of any complaint against her (which I inferred from the submission), and Mr. Storey did not elaborate on what (if any) &#8216;question mark&#8217; is being referred to.  I am not in a position to form a view as to the relevance (if any) of this submission; indeed in the absence of any supporting evidence, I consider that the submission should never have been made.  Nor, rightly, did Mr. Storey press hard the fact of the co-operation of the parents following the fact-finding hearing; to the parents&#8217; credit, they did co-operate with the social worker to achieve the rehabilitation of their children and (so far as I know) thereafter, but this does not amount to a basis for challenging the earlier finding.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, in October 2012, the treating clinicians at Great Ormond Street Hospital were plainly of the view that it was of significance to their investigations into the cause of AD&#8217;s catastrophic injuries that the segment of AD&#8217;s skull, removed during surgery on 24 October, should be analysed by a histopathologist of national renown.  Regrettably, as we now know, it was not so tested at the time.  The results of pathological analysis of the skull performed much more recently (2015) reveal clinical findings of potential interest and significance to our understanding of AD&#8217;s vulnerability to bony injury.  Specifically, while the skull thickness and its bony characteristics were not known at the time of my original findings, the evidence now available reveals features which may indicate material weakness.  While there is a difference of opinion (Cohen / Freemont) as to (a) the findings, and (b) their significance, the evidence could impact directly on some of the earlier evidence, specifically that of Dr. Fairhurst and Dr. Cartlidge.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, and linked with the point above, Professor Stephen Nussey, on whose evidence I placed considerable reliance at the fact-finding hearing, has now had the chance to express further opinion on the issue of bony fragility in light of the results of the skull sample testing (see [36] above).  I have set out his earlier opinions above (including notably his comment that vitamin D deficiency &#8220;was not of such a magnitude as to have played a significant role in bone fragility predisposing AD to any of the fractures (including the vertebral fractures) [60] of my original judgment), but his earlier opinion was moderated by a degree of frustration at the lack of adequate information, and the &#8220;limited <span style="font-style:italic">reliable</span> information&#8221; (see his Third Addendum Report: 11 June 2013: my emphasis).  It is fair to observe that there is now more information, and I cannot confidently say that it would not make a difference to his view.   Indeed, from the material I have seen, I detect a <span style="font-style:italic">possible</span> shift in his assessment of the case.  Guarding myself against the possibility that the shift may be more perceived than real, and conscious that any such shift may makes no material difference to his ultimate opinion, these are issues which ought legitimately to be revisited.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, I am satisfied that aspects of the newly obtained medical evidence (some of which is summarised in the paragraph above) cast a sufficiently fresh perspective on the evidence previously adduced as to warrant review.  Dr. Cohen&#8217;s findings of woven bones materially suggests vitamin D deficiency, and/or osteopenia in AD (a finding which Dr. Watt considers is &#8220;unusual&#8221; in a child of this age); her discovery that the skull was particularly thin at the fracture site, while not uncontroversial, may be material in understanding causation of the fracture.  There is greater scope for the argument that a short fall (such as described in the &#8216;4.30p.m. incident&#8217;) may have been sufficient to cause the injury (see [54-58] above).  I would be assisted to know the views of Mr. Richards and others on Dr. Cohen&#8217;s opinion that it is &#8220;anatomically plausible&#8221; that the fractured bones may have torn the dura in order to cause the subdural haemorrhage (see [49] above); this scenario was not previously considered.  Dr. Hyman&#8217;s view (see [59] above) that the vertebral fractures show &#8220;two different patterns on imaging&#8221; (indications of fracture at two different times) is inconsistent with my earlier finding of an isolated incident, and is worthy of reconsideration.</p>
