The four children were wrongfully removed from their care, they were wrongfully or unlawfully placed with foster parents, they would not give up seeking their return, and no-one should adopt or even attempt to adopt the children. In the second separate video the parents wanted anyone who had any information about the four children to communicate with them because the children had been stolen from them.</p>

Mr R explained that they wished to meet the adopters. That should be ordered. They also wished to cross-examine witnesses. They wanted to be assured about the adopters. Their purpose was to stop the adoption though equally I gathered that they wished to meet the prospective adopters to reassure themselves.</p>

They consider it unjustly made, and they will do all within their power to prevent the children being adopted. Far from seeking reassurance I am satisfied that the parents, were they to meet the adopters, would amongst other things seek to dissuade them from that course.</p>

In those circumstances, both the prohibitory and the mandatory orders originally obtained without notice should continue. Without that there is a risk that the adoption will not go ahead as the parents intend. It is a proportionate remedy to the serious threat to those proceedings presented by the parents.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">This is an unusual case. It is not directly to do with freedom of speech. It is concerned with parents who do not accept the court's judgment in respect of their children and are intent on defeating their adoption. They want their children home and not placed for adoption. Appeals have failed. They therefore seek to prevent prospective adopters from pursuing their application to adopt.</p>

They are the rights to respect for private and family life and the right to freedom of expression. It is the tension between them which is usually crucial as neither has precedence.</p>
