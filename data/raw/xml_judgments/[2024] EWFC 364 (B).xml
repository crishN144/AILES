	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This judgment, handed down on 12 December 2024, sets out my reasons for adjourning Leicestershire County Council&#8217;s (LCC) application for care orders issued on 20 February 2024. The matter stands at 40 weeks. It was previously adjourned in October 2024, because the court failed to book the appropriate interpreters required for the parents to have a fair hearing. This happened, despite my efforts, to make plain, in the case management order of 1 August 2024, that two Sign Supported English (SSE) and two Lipspeaking SSE interpreters were required - given that both parents are deaf persons. That error was not due to local court staff, who for the purposes of this hearing, have worked hard with FPL staff to ensure that the parents have had the right interpreters for this hearing. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This judgment deals with the application on behalf of the parents for the matter to be adjourned. This application comes on day four of this second final hearing, having heard oral evidence from Dawn Knighton, the Independent Social Worker who has undertaken a Parent Assess assessment of the parents&#8217; parenting capacity within these proceedings, a family support worker who gave evidence about alleged breaches of a safety plan a previous adult social worker (ASW) who did a Care and Support Assessment of the mother in July 2024 which is dated 12 September 2024, and at the conclusion of the team manager&#8217;s (TM) evidence in which she made a number of concessions about the failings in the way in which LCC has worked with and/or delivered interventions with each of the parents.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I have been very careful in this judgment to note that I have not heard all of the local authority&#8217;s evidence. Further, despite giving the TM permission overnight (in the middle of her evidence) to go through the children&#8217;s social care files to look for relevant specialist referrals (which should have been set out in the local authority&#8217;s chronology filed at the start of these proceedings but was not), I have not yet allowed any updating documents to be released into these proceedings which specifically address the status of what referrals were made between 2017 (after the conclusion of the previous proceedings) and 2023 when the children were back on Child Protection Plans. I have also noted that whilst some concessions were made by the TM in her evidence about LCC&#8217;s failings, the local authority does not accept all of the criticisms made by the parents.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The parents say that the matter should be adjourned for LCC to hold a Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting (MDT), given that one has never been held either in 2024 or in 2023, and for LCC to file and serve a proper &#8216;integrated care plan&#8217; setting out the practical support the parents could be offered so that the court can be satisfied that LCC has thoroughly and fairly explored both support from its own resources and from the other agencies, like Adult Social Care. </span></p>

More regularly the prevailing concerns centre on a perceived risk of neglect, both as the result of the parents' intellectual impairments, and the impact of the social and economic deprivation commonly faced by adults with learning difficulties. It is in this context that a shift must be made from the old assumption that adults with learning difficulties could not parent to a process of questioning why appropriate levels of support are not provided to them so that they can parent successfully and why their children should often be taken into care. At its simplest, this means a court carefully inquiring as to what support is needed to enable parents to show whether or not they can become good enough parents rather than automatically assuming that they are destined to fail. </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#2A2A2A">The concept of "parenting with support" must move from the margins to the mainstream in court determination.&#8217;</span></p>

I could not understand how such an assessment could list recommendations for interventions and support for the mother, how she could agree to the referrals/potential support suggested but then be recorded as &#8216;service user is eligible for services but does not wish to proceed at this time&#8217;. The updating statement by another worker did not assist me and it was poor that the assessment was done in July and produced in September, yet save for the referral to OT, none of the recommendations for referral had been completed by the time of this final hearing. Amy has not even had the financial eligibility assessment she agreed to in order to explore whether she could have the services of a personal assistant (PA) subject to any contributory costs to be paid by her. </span></p>

In reality, she wasn&#8217;t declining anything at all because the parameters of the offer were not clear at that visit; and iv) a telephone call between this worker and the social worker was not enough.

This is because what has gone in so far has not been designed in a way that is targeted, that is bespoke, that has been planned with specialist advice, nor has it been coordinated in a way that is both necessary and fair. </span></p>
