	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I heard this case over three days towards the end of November 2017.  On the last day, which was a Friday, it was not possible for me to give an ex tempore judgment because there was insufficient time left at the end of the day.  I was  clear at that stage as to my findings and conclusions in relation to this case, but because of the lack of time I had to reserve this judgment.  I prepared a written judgment very shortly afterwards while the facts and evidence and issues in this case were all very clear in my mind, but it has not been possible for me to deliver it before today.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unfortunately, in the intervening month this case has not progressed in the way that it was hoped and contemplated it would between then and now.  First, the father has found it necessary to cease instructing his solicitors and most excellent and helpful counsel, Mr Oliver Thorne, and he now acts in person.  He says, and I accept, that he simply cannot afford to pay any more money to lawyers, and he wishes to conserve such funds as he has for the needs of his children.  The unfortunate consequence of that is that it was contemplated that the solicitors and/or Mr Thorne would help the father with steps that it was hoped would be taken between then and now, and it may be in part because the lawyers are no longer instructed that those steps have not been effectively taken.</p>
	    </content>

	    <num>3.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Second, it was contemplated that the father would send appropriate letters and small gifts for each of the children concerned.  In the case of the elder child they were to be sent via her school, who had agreed to help.  Unfortunately it is only very recently that the father has in fact sent a letter and gifts.  The school is now closed for the Christmas holidays.  The letter in fact went to CAFCASS.  I have just been shown a copy of the letter, and it is obvious that it contains within it inappropriate references to the proceedings and the history of this matter, which the father should not be discussing in his first letter to the children for a very long time.  So CAFCASS have not forwarded that letter for the children, although the mother and her legal advisors have seen it.  The sad part is that if the father was still instructing his lawyers they might have been able to advise him and assist him in writing a letter that was entirely appropriate and not including inappropriate matters.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third difficulty is that it was clearly contemplated at the last hearing that there would be proactive contact with a local contact centre called Springbourne in order to ascertain what support and help they could give for this father and the younger child in particular.  The father has indeed filled in a pro forma referral form of Springbourne Family Centre, but as of today there is simply no information from that centre in response as to the ways in which they might be able to help in this case.  So, regrettably, much less progress has been made between the last hearing and today than I was contemplating and hoping.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When I drafted the written judgment it was somewhat inconclusive at the end, precisely because I was waiting to see how developments did unfold between then and now.  What I propose to do is to deliver verbatim the written judgment which I prepared.  I will indicate the point at which the written judgment ends and I will then give my conclusions as to the way forward.  With that preamble I now commence reading from the written judgment which I prepared several weeks ago.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a sensitive and difficult case with regard to contact.  I was asked to hear it at very short notice when I happened to become free in Portsmouth due to a case there settling, and the district judge before whom this case had been listed for some months in Bournemouth fell ill with influenza.   When I agreed very late one afternoon to hear this case in Bournemouth the following morning, I did not even know the name or nature of the case. I only knew that there was a crisis with which I agreed to help.  </p>

	    <num>7.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I mention all this for the following reason. As I will later explain, this case will inevitably require further hearings, possibly several.  I sit primarily in London.  It would be totally unrealistic to expect these parents, who both live in the Poole/Bournemouth area, to travel to London for any future hearing in a case of this kind. They have neither the time nor the means to do so.  The mother, in particular, is very tied down by the needs of the younger child who has a chromosomal disability.  It is also totally unrealistic to contemplate that I can, proportionately, keep taking days out from the overcrowded London diary to travel to Bournemouth to hear this case.  </p>

	    <num>8.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, it would be likely to involve unacceptable delays.  That is perhaps illustrated by the fact that the present hearing concluded on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2017, but today, 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, is the first date upon which it was possible to arrange for me to sit in Bournemouth to deliver this judgment.  It may be a weakness in the system, but a High Court Judge (other than perhaps a Family Division Liaison Judge) simply cannot give to a case of this kind the continuing local judicial continuity which it requires.</p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_9">
	    <num>9.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By this judgment I propose, therefore, to make and record my findings on the essential disputed facts and to make one interim order.  Thereafter, this case must be allocated with maximum judicial continuity to a circuit or district judge who sits regularly in Bournemouth, and he or she must take it forward.</p>
	    </content>

	    <num>10.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case the mother makes allegations of domestic harm and abuse against the father.  If the revised Practice Direction 12J issued in October 2017 had been in force in August, the directions given on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2017 might have provided for a discrete and freestanding fact-finding hearing.  As it is, those directions provided that the present hearing should be a &#8220;final hearing&#8221; and that &#8220;insofar as the allegations may be relevant to any child arrangements order that may be made at a hearing, the truth of them can be determined at that hearing.&#8221;  This has not turned out to be &#8220;a final hearing&#8221; and, as already indicated, further hearings will undoubtedly be necessary unless the parents reach some accommodation. So this hearing has been a combination of hearing oral evidence upon the disputed facts, and consideration of the way forward, including hearing in that regard the oral evidence of the CAFCASS officer, Mr Guy Cowmeadow.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this particular case there are very few facts indeed about which I could, or do, feel sure except those which are patent or agreed, but where I describe or make findings as to any facts I do so on the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probability.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father is now aged 49 and the mother is 36.  They both originate from Afghanistan and are of the Muslim culture and faith.  Their marriage was an arranged one in 1998, when the mother was aged 16.  Soon afterwards the father moved in 1999 to England, where he has lived ever since.  He is now a British citizen.  Several years later, in July 2006, the mother also moved to England and she, too, is now a British citizen.  Their elder child, M, was born in September 2007. She is now aged 10.  At that time the parents were living together.</p>

In about January 2012 she moved back to the refuge in Poole and remained there until about December 2012.  In December 2012 the mother moved with M into her own rented accommodation in Bournemouth Road, Poole.  </p>

Their second child, a son, I, was born in March 2013 and is now aged about four and three-quarters.  He suffers from a genetic chromosomal abnormality which results in physical and intellectual developmental delay and anticipated learning difficulties.  He cannot yet walk well and has limited use of speech and language.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In late August 2013 the mother moved with both children from her address in Bournemouth Road to her present rented accommodation in Poole, and she and they have lived there ever since.  She receives no regular support from the father, who is a taxi driver, and she has been, and remains, entirely dependent upon state benefits.  She has no family in England and little or no support network or back-up for caring for her children and, in particular,  I, who is especially dependent upon her due to his disability.  Despite these difficulties and burdens, the mother looks after both children well.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is quite clear that in a period from 2013 to late 2015 both parents and both children did spend time together in local parks and other places such as Longleat Park in Wiltshire.  In August 2015 they spent three days at Legoland near Windsor, where they stayed in a hotel together.  The parents and children shared one family bedroom, but the parents did not share a bed.  The father has produced numerous still photographs and some short video clips of these various outings, which appear to have been happy family events for the children.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother says that she was willing to participate for the sake of the children and that the children did indeed have happy times and enjoy them.  She stresses, however, that she was always present so as to be reassuring for the children.  She says that apart from the 10 days or so when M stayed with the father immediately after the birth if I, the children have only very rarely been alone with their father.  On one occasion M spent a short period with the father after he collected her from school.  On one occasion both children were cared for by the father for a couple of hours while the mother was treated at hospital after an accident.  Apart from that, the mother cannot recall either child being cared for by the father on his own since she left the refuge in December 2012.  To all intents and purposes, therefore, the father has never cared for I on his own.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since about October 2015 the relationship between the parents seems completely to have broken down and the father has not seen either of the children.  In late November 2016 he issued his application for a child arrangements order.  Unhelpfully and unwisely, the form C100 described the application on page 1 and again in section 5 as being &#8220;for the children to live with me and/or for the time I spend with the children&#8221;.   An application for an order that the children move to live with him must have seemed very threatening to the mother.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application also disclosed that during 2015 the father had made covert recordings in the mother&#8217;s home of, he said, the mother slapping M and shouting at the children.  I agree with the CAFCASS officer, Mr Guy Cowmeadow, that the making of covert recordings was a deceitful act which only tends further to undermine any trust by the mother in the father.</p>

She says that she has suffered from physical, emotional and psychological abuse.  She says that he was violent towards her in front of the children by hitting her and saying inappropriate words and threatening her.  He threatened to kill her or burn her or cut [off] her head.

Of these, allegations 4 and 5 pertain to stalking or following her in 2015 after they were separated.  Allegations 1, 2 and 3 pertain to the period when they were still living together.  The first allegation, 1, dates from December 2008, now nine years ago.  It is not disputed by the father that there was an altercation that day and the police were called.  The mother said in her oral evidence that she was sitting on the sofa.  The father picked her up and manhandled her to the bedroom and onto the bed.  In her oral evidence the mother said that, as she tried to pull herself up to a sitting position on the bed, the father punched her in the chest.  He pushed her to lie down and slapped her.  He hit her on the shoulder and on the side of her leg.  In cross-examination she said that she put her hand on his chest and asked him to stop and that was when he punched her. </p>

The father&#8217;s contemporary account as recorded by the police, now at bundle page F11, was that he &#8220;pushed&#8221; the side of her face with his open right hand, and he indicated a slapping movement, although he said to the police that he did not actually slap her face. </p>

I need to bear in mind also that English is not the first language of either party and that even now, nine years further on, the mother does not always express herself in English with clarity.   I do not doubt the integrity of her oral evidence to me that she recalls the father punch her.  I am unable positively to conclude (on a balance of probability) that he did actually punch her in the sense of using a clenched fist, but I am quite satisfied that there was a physical assault.  The father was the aggressor and perpetrator, and he was abusive towards the mother by manhandling her onto the bed and hitting her (even if only with an open hand as a slap) while she was upon the bed. </p>

As I have already noted, she was describing events between about five and nine years ago.  Her use of English is not always clear and reliable.  I listened at some length to the evidence of the mother, including under sustained and skilled cross-examination by Mr Thorne.  I listened also to the evidence and denials of the father.  I have to record that in general terms I found the evidence and affect of the mother to be convincing, and the almost total denials of the father to be unconvincing.  I am quite satisfied to the civil standard that the essential account of the mother of control reinforced by threats and physical assaults upon her is a true one, which she gave with obvious sadness and appropriate affect.  She may not now be always reliable, but she is not deliberately fabricating, and her account has a core of truth even if some of the detail is not reliable or confuses aspects of one event with another.   I conclude that during their relationship the father was controlling of the mother and frequently physically and verbally abusive towards her.</p>

He has not witnessed the abuse between the parents, and indeed the first sentence of paragraph 19 of Mr Cowmeadow&#8217;s report must be mistaken in this regard, although the mother claimed that I had observed one occasion of violence.   His chromosomal abnormality and its effects is described in letters from Dr Delyth Howard, a consultant community paediatrician, dated 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2016 and 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January 2017, now at bundle pages E10 and E12.  (The account in those letters of his developmental stage is, of course, now about a year out of date.)</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In summary, I has general developmental delay which affects his physical movements, including walking, and his speech and communication, and may in the longer term impact upon his behaviour.  I accept the evidence of the mother that these effects make him more dependent upon her than if he was a normal boy of his age.  Because of his communication delays I&#8217;s wishes and feelings with regard to contact were not ascertainable by Mr Cowmeadow.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the case of I a reservation was raised whether the father could manage and cope with his particular physical disabilities and limitations during even supervised direct contact.  In my view that could not be a reason for not attempting supervised direct contact, but, rather, for observing it closely and providing assistance to the father if he needs it.  In my view there are no grounds for not attempting some carefully structured and supervised contact between I and his father.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was considerable discussion at the hearing as to the availability of a suitable centre.  In the end it was narrowed down to Springbourne in Bournemouth.  I was inclining at the conclusion of the hearing to make an activity direction under the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>; but I made clear that the father must first produce a package from Springbourne describing who they are, what they can provide, timescales and cost.  Before contact is embarked upon, the father will need to demonstrate his willingness and ability to provide the funding, for no one else will do so.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Insofar as M is concerned, it remains my position and view that a guardian must be appointed to represent her.  There will have to be a further hearing once the guardian is fully appraised of, and on top of, this case.  Meantime I hope, despite the regrettable difficulties during the last month, that the father will be able to write appropriate letters together with appropriate gifts (such as an age-appropriate magazine) which can be sent to M via her school, as was contemplated at the last hearing.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as I is concerned, it remains my view that the court and the legal system must not give up at this stage upon the attempt to promote direct contact between I and his father, even if that may require to be supervised for a long time to come.  Unfortunately the groundwork has not been done with Springbourne that was contemplated by Mr Thorne at the end of the oral hearing and as I have just described in the prepared written part of this judgment.  Now that he is acting in person, I appreciate that it may be less easy for the father to make forward progress.  That, I am afraid, is a difficulty inherent in the relative lack of available  legal aid and in his own financial constraints.  He must obtain such help as he can within the community.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I cannot today make any order for actual supervised direct contact at Springbourne or any other centre for, frankly, I do not know enough today about what such a centre could, and would, actually do in this case.  Further, it appears that Springbourne would require a prior risk assessment.  I do not know who would undertake that risk assessment, but as a first step, once a transcript of this judgment is available it can, of course, be supplied to Springbourne.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So in the upshot I make no order as to direct contact in relation to either child and I can do little more as a conclusion to this hearing than direct that a guardian be appointed to act for M and that there be a further hearing as soon as possible after 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April 2017 before the allocated local judge once he or she has been identified.  </p>
