They separated in August or September 2011, and Mrs Hopkins has told me that as far as she was concerned, their marriage was effectively over some 6 months earlier than that. These proceedings began in January 2013, and have now cost the parties a combined figure of &#163;758,654. In addition to the provision contained in an agreement which they signed in August 2011, and which she has received but for the implementation of an agreed pension sharing order, Mrs Hopkins sought by her position statement a further &#163;2million. Her husband offers her a sum of &#163;200,000 in addition to such provision. Thus, at trial, in purely financial terms, their costs have taken up over 42% of the issue, between the parties.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The reason for this unhappy situation is that the parties&#8217; August 2011 agreement, which describes itself as &#8216;Post-Nuptial&#8217;, purports to limit and define appropriate provision in the event of marital breakdown between the parties. It was an agreement arrived at between them in principle in the spring of 2011, just over 5 months after the landmark decision of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Radmacher (formerly Granatino)</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">v Granatino</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> [2010] UKSC 427</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> was handed down in the Supreme Court</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">. It is Mrs Hopkins&#8217; case that this agreement &#8216;is vitiated by duress; alternatively unconscionable conduct such as undue pressure (falling short of duress); alternatively other unworthy conduct, such as exploitation of a dominant position to secure unfair advantage&#8217;. The court is asked to take into account Mrs Hopkins&#8217; &#8216;emotional state and what pressures she was under to agree&#8217;. Her Counsel also argue questions of fairness and need that will be dealt with later.</span></p>

Both parties have given evidence to me and were in court throughout. I have also had the opportunity of reading a transcript of the entirety of the wife&#8217;s evidence, which was provided to me by Counsel after the conclusion of their submissions. Neither party called any other witness to support their respective cases, which has meant that I have no reason to doubt or challenge any of the statements or assertions made by others and recorded in the case papers before me. The detailed background is helpfully set out in an agreed chronology which runs to some 20 pages. What I set out here is only what seems to me the most pertinent to the issues which I have had to decide.</span></p>

They first met when the husband was around 28 and the wife 25, and were both then otherwise married and with young children from those relationships. They commenced what the wife&#8217;s former solicitor has described as a &#8216;clandestine&#8217; affair, at a time when the husband was still living with his first wife and the wife was living with another man, having separated from her first husband. During that relationship, the parties never cohabited, but did have a son, William, born on 7</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> September 1981.

He also provided for some work to be done on the property. The wife also made a contribution to this. The relationship between them ended in 1982 or 1983, and the husband remained living with his then wife Anne. In 1986, the wife married for a second time, to a man named Peter Griffiths, who had moved into 91 Brook Street to live with her. That marriage was to last for 13 years, and produce one further child. </span></p>

At the end of that year, the parties went on holiday together and the husband separated from Anne, to whom he had by then been married to for some 29 years. During 2001, the parties began to cohabit together in a property, owned by one of the husband&#8217;s business concerns, called Lynwood. In that year the husband&#8217;s marriage to Anne is dissolved. In 2002, the wife&#8217;s marriage to Peter Griffiths is also dissolved. In November 2003, the parties moved into the husband&#8217;s former matrimonial home at Penselwood, near Wincanton, upon Anne vacating the property.</span></p>

Even if the agreement does not have contractual force, those factors will negate any effect the agreement might otherwise have. But unconscionable conduct such as undue pressure (falling short of duress) will also be likely to eliminate the weight to be attached to the agreement, and other unworthy conduct, such as exploitation of a dominant position to secure an unfair advantage, would reduce or eliminate it.</span></p>

For such couples their experience of previous relationships may explain the terms of the agreement, and may also show what they foresaw when they entered into the agreement.

The problem arises where the agreement makes provisions that conflict with what the court would otherwise consider to be the requirements of fairness. The fact of the agreement is capable of altering what is fair. It is an important factor to be weighed in the balance.

On proof of these two matters the stage is set for the court to infer that, in the absence of a satisfactory explanation, the transaction can only have been procured by undue influence. In other words, proof of these two facts is prima facie evidence that the defendant abused the influence he acquired in the parties' relationship. He preferred his own interests.

Notwithstanding the difficulties in carrying out a precise calculation of the value of the matrimonial assets, a joint schedule has been prepared for this trial setting out what the parties have and how they hold it. The main computational issue relates to the value of the husband&#8217;s business interests, in relation to which the wife&#8217;s approach is to take a simple balance sheet valuation in relation to the various companies which he controls, by which she arrives at a total of &#163;49.7 million for the value of his business assets. The husband&#8217;s own figure is somewhat discounted at &#163;35.1 million, and this is the principal cause for the variance in the asset totals provided for each party: &#163;54.3 million for the wife; &#163;38.4 million for the husband. In fact, neither side have sought to attempt any reconciliation, and the disparity has no effect on outcome.</span></p>

She has in her possession 2 properties, both those passed in the 2011 negotiations, which are Lynwood &#8211; her present home, which is unencumbered with a net equity after costs of sale agreed at &#163;533,500; and 7 Meadow Close, a smaller investment property which I shall take to have a value of &#163;250,000 &#8211; the value ascribed for mortgage purposes recently, when the wife borrowed &#163;151,045 against its security to fund in part her costs of these proceedings. This produces net after 3% costs of sale an equity value of &#163;91,455.

Further, amongst her liabilities she lists a loan from Will, in the sum of &#163;86,000, which she proceeds to deduct from her assets. In addition she still owes her solicitors, after the above referred to mortgage over 7 Meadow Close, the sum of &#163;85,738. She has other current debts of &#163;2,461.

In order to determine the strength of the case which the wife puts, it has been necessary to assess carefully both the produced documents and the oral evidence which both parties have given to me during the course of the final hearing. Following that analysis a clear picture has emerged. I shall deal with the separate elements of the wife&#8217;s case in turn. Firstly, and despite receiving copious amounts of specialist matrimonial advice, the wife says that she failed to properly read or understand it, and consequently that its receipt is not an insurmountable hurdle to her in throwing of the burden of the agreement.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The wife&#8217;s task in relation to this first limb of her case is made much harder by the history which has emerged during the course of the proceedings. This has seen her visit a matrimonial specialist solicitor &#8211; the same Mr Stokes who now represents her in these proceedings &#8211; twice before the PNA came to be discussed in 2011. First she saw him in 2006, long before the parties&#8217; marriage. She told me that that was just to discuss her position in the event of Mr Hopkins&#8217; death &#8211; and not to do with any perceived difficulties in their then cohabiting relationship. This contention is not entirely supported by Mr Stokes&#8217; attendance note of that meeting, at which she told him that: &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">We have been living together &#8211; it&#8217;s been hard work. I love him I&#8217;m not sure that he loves me&#8230;we have talked about splitting</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.&#8217; Further, the letter of advice which Mr Stokes wrote to the wife subsequently in July 2010 stated that: &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Notwithstanding your consultation with me in March 2006 and the advice I gave you, you separated from Mr Hopkins in November 2008&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. So it is clear, as I find, that in 2006 the wife did seek advice from Mr Stokes about her position in the event of relationship breakdown, despite her denial.</span></p>

In his 21 page letter of advice, Mr Stokes makes it very clear. &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">You have asked me to advise you with regard to matrimonial causes and, prospectively, to represent you in them&#8217;. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The advice which he gives her in that letter (described as a &#8216;summary&#8217; to follow their meeting, although he had also undertaken some further research into the husband&#8217;s asset position) is full and careful. It is based upon the premise that the husband&#8217;s resources encompass at least &#163;46-7 million. The wife&#8217;s evidence is that she simply did not read the letter fully through at all until she went back to Mr Stokes, long after the PNA was signed, in December 2012.</span></p>

Notwithstanding that subterfuge, she told me that on receipt she merely skim read the first few pages and then gave up. This might just have taken her to the point on the fourth page of the letter where Mr Stokes wrote: &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">You have asked me advise you with regard to the financial provision, which will be made for you on divorce&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. Her case is that she did not read on. She also told me that she did not read further when Mr Stokes resent the letter by email in November 2010, even though she referred at the time to her husband&#8217;s reaction &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">if he&#8217;d known what you&#8217;d actually sent me&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.

I find that at the very latest by the time she went to see Mr Martin in late February 2011, and probably earlier, she had read Mr Stokes letter through, properly and to the end.</span></p>

I find that this allegation is not made out, as the suggestion for the transfer of Lynwood came from the wife herself, and is not referred to in Mr Stokes&#8217; letter. Whilst the wife accepted that she never asked for more than the provision offered, she had also told the husband that she had seen Mr Stokes, and knew as I find at the latest during March 2011 that her husband had seen his letter of advice. I do not accept that the husband&#8217;s reading of that letter had a material effect, either on his position in the discussions, or on the wife&#8217;s.</span></p>

I do consider that, having received that advice, the burden clearly shifts to the wife to demonstrate that notwithstanding the advice, her free will was nevertheless overborne by the husband. It is clear that for her, at the time of signing, immediate separation was more important. That was something which she wanted to achieve, and which the husband wished to avoid. I have to consider whether in those circumstances she signed because of any improper pressure from the husband, or simply because the wife wanted to bring the partnership at least in the short term to an end.</span></p>

He had been told by the wife of her visit to Mr Stokes in July 2010. When searching for the parties&#8217; marriage certificate prior to his first visit to PHB, he accepts that he found, and read, the letter of advice that Mr Stokes had written to her following that meeting. He told the wife that this had happened. He did not tell PHB of this until much later, in 2014. The letter included express reference to the starting of proceedings in Bristol or Exeter, potentially before HHJ Wildblood QC, a judge with significant financial remedy experience. The husband knows that judge. He was concerned that the proceedings, if they were to follow, should not proceed in his local area where confidentiality might be threatened. He therefore instructed PHB to issue in London as a precautionary measure. The petition was not served for another month because he was still then hoping to effect a reconciliation.</span></p>

For example, on 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">st</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> March 2011 she sent an email to Mr Martin in which she said this: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;(Baroness Shackleton) advised him to start the divorce proceedings on their first meeting, before I met you I believe, but he asked her not to send the papers out because he was hoping for a reconciliation, and it would upset me!</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8217; I take this to be entirely consistent with the husband&#8217;s case on this point. I also keep in mind that when in 2008 the parties had separated for a short period, the letter which the husband wrote prior to the wife&#8217;s return was in very similar terms to those which he sent in 2011 especially the second letter sent on 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> June, where he essentially attempted to take all of the undoubted problems in the relationship onto his own shoulders in an attempt to win the wife back.

And whilst the wife had evinced a determination to exit the marriage throughout the period of the negotiation, starting with her initial expressions to Mr Martin on 26</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> February that &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">the marriage had broken down irretrievably and that there was no chance of saving it</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8217; she nevertheless engaged in counselling until April, and agreed to the conclusion of a Post-Nuptial Agreement, which concessions at least must have been sufficient to give the husband a measure of hope that the marriage could be saved. The letter which she sent in June 2011 headed &#8216;How Things Could Change!!&#8217; is only consistent with her giving the husband to believe, whether or not honestly, that there might still be some hope for the relationship. The PNA was not consequently &#8216;a dishonest document&#8217; when signed in August 2011.</span></p>

As I have already indicated, I do not read those letters literally in that way.

The balance of the missive reveals that the author had certainly read Alexander Thorpe&#8217;s advice, in some detail. The wife indicates that she will have her computer with her on holiday, so will be able to respond to any necessary amendments while she is away.

In addition she sought the investment property at 7 Meadow Close, then unencumbered, and the Audi car. It does not appear that she made any further specific requests.

He had been told that the wife was not extravagant, and would struggle to set out a budget of &#163;50,000pa.

It is simply not credible that he was mistaken in recording his instructions to this extent, and I find that the wife certainly described the payment as a loan at that time. Similarly, Mr Martin&#8217;s first attendance note in 2011 describes the wife as having &#8216;lent&#8217; the funds.

She was constrained to acknowledge that, in the event that she was unsuccessful in her claim, he would not seek repayment of the funds. Given that I have rejected her evidence in relation to the loan, I must take that figure as no more than a part repayment of the sum that I find to be due. The other principal liability is to her solicitor, in the sum of &#163;85,738, and is clearly due however.</span></p>

I accept that the husband had not been told of this at the time, but I consider it appropriate to treat the outstanding sum due from William as being two thirds of the sum due, or &#163;190,000. Of this, William has evidently repaid &#163;86,000, which leaves a further &#163;104,000 still owing. This is just more than enough to meet the wife&#8217;s additional unpaid legal bills and other smaller debts - &#163;88,200. These can therefore be set off against each other, leaving the wife with a small surplus of &#163;15,800.</span></p>

In addition to indicating through Mr Todd QC that no costs order would be sought in the event that the PNA was upheld, the husband offers an additional payment to the wife in the sum of &#163;200,000. It can be seen that this is almost exactly sufficient to meet the wife&#8217;s needs as I have quantified them, adopting the housing needs she herself has expressed at the time of the agreement, and allowing her to maintain her unvarnished Form E budget. The further surplus of &#163;18,700 may leave the wife with total additional funds of &#163;34,500, which she should retain.</span></p>

I acknowledge that this may be some distance from the order which the Court might have made had there been no agreement, or had the agreement been accorded no weight. The Court may then have had to involve itself in questions of valuation, active or passive growth, mingling and the quality of cohabitation &#8211; with uncertain outcome.

I have found that this was an agreement freely entered into on both sides, and with full advice. It achieved what the wife was very keen to achieve at the point of its completion, that is an immediate escape from the husband, despite his desire for reconciliation. She understood at the time that it was a watertight agreement which would bind her, and she thereafter accepted it as binding upon her for a further 16 months. It is not an agreement which pays no regard to her needs.</span></p>

This in itself must be a reflection of the fact that this agreement represents an acknowledgment by both parties that needs based quantification is fair to the wife. The difference between their two positions has essentially been whether those needs should be generously or more realistically assessed. That therefore is where the existence of the agreement has made a difference. That is fair.</span></p>

In the absence of any compelling evidence that the wife did not enter into this agreement of her own free will, as she contends, and in the face of clear evidence that she had comprehensive advice about her entitlements otherwise, and the binding nature of the agreement; and further that she herself, notwithstanding that advice, has not seriously contended for more than a needs based award, which is what the agreement had given her; it is fair to hold her now to the terms of the PNA, and conversely unfair to the husband to make any different provision.</span></p>

This imbalance reflects the fact that the wife&#8217;s needs have been engaged, but also serves to demonstrate that those needs would equally have been met by the original agreement arrived at in 2011, and that the need for additional payment has solely been created by the expense of these proceedings.</span></p>
