In reality, her family circumstances are that both parents are deceased; she has a brother, but refuses to accept that she is related to him, and she is in fact divorced from her former husband, having two children from her marriage to him.  They have no contact with her.  Her delusions are deeply entrenched, despite clear and obvious evidence to the contrary.  They have not been shifted by medication.  Currently, she is not receiving anti-psychotic medication because she has refused it and she has not been subjected to compulsory medication in that respect pursuant to Part IV of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref>.</p>

However she refused any blood tests or further investigations despite being asked to consider a blood test and possible ultrasound.  She persisted in this attitude.  She was transferred to the care of her treating Consultant Psychiatrist in September 2005 when the swelling became more noticeable, but she refused to acknowledge it or to allow examination and investigation.  By December 2005, she had suffered abdominal pain for several months which began to intensify; she also experienced sickness on several occasions. </p>

The abdomen and tumour wee drained and later a CT scan confirmed a large ovarian tumour with strong indications that the tumour might be malignant and that H was suffering from ovarian cancer. She  was advised of the CT scan findings, the diagnosis, and that she needed surgery to remove the tumour, the preferred surgical procedure being a laparotomy (surgical incision of the abdomen) an ovarian cystectomy (removal of the cystal tumour), total abdominal hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and cervix) and bi-lateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes) with removal of the greater omenteum (abdominal fatty tissue) and peritoneal sampling (removal of peritoneal tissue for biopsy).  These were refused.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The drainage procedure relieved the pain and distress caused by the tumour and H&#8217;s mood and demeanour improved.  However the tumour re-grew rapidly, and by late December 2005, H was suffering from intermittent twinges of pain.  In mid-January, though nervous, she appeared to agree to surgery.  However, when admitted to surgery on 26 January she adamantly refused surgery, saying that she wished to have more children and to continue to have her periods.  She refused to consent to a suggested course of more limited surgery namely the removal of the tumour and the affected ovary (&#8220;the secondary surgical procedure&#8221;).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thereafter she has continued to suffer physical distress and pain secondary to her tumour and has refused all physical interventions despite at times being  in obvious pain.  She is now short of breath and has to be propped up with pillows in bed in order to assist her difficulty in breathing.  She has lost an appreciable amount of weight due to the pressure of the tumour and the consequent restriction on her stomach and intestines.  She is thought to be extremely worried about the tumour and the pain and distress that she is suffering, but is adamant that she does not want surgery.  On 12 April, the Responsible Medical Officer: Dr A discussed the position with her, telling her that Dr L, a Consultant Psychiatrist and independent expert instructed by the Trusts considered that she lacked capacity to make decision about her gynaecological problems and that a judge would be asked to decide if she needed an operation.  She replied that she did not want anyone to touch her and that the mass was &#8220;just food&#8221;.  Although apparently in pain, she denied that was so and, indeed, denied that she was having to lie propped on pillows in order to ease her breathing.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as H&#8217;s diagnosis condition and prognosis are concerned, they are agreed that (a) her physical condition must be causing her appreciable discomfort which it is likely will impact on her mental health (b) she is currently experiencing breathing difficulties and cannot eat properly, that her symptoms will get worse and could well end her life whether or not the cyst is malignant.  There is no feasible alternative to surgery available to manage her condition (c) H could theoretically have repeated aspirations (drainage of the cyst).  However, the positive impact of such treatment was previously short-lived.  Such drainage would become progressively more hazardous with a high chance of bowel damage and morbidity.  The drainage cannot treat the cancer; it simply will temporary relieve its effect.  (d) H could be given a strong morphine analgesic to relieve her discomfort but this would have an adverse affect on her already compromised breathing (e) It is in H&#8217;s best interests to undergo surgery to treat her abdominal condition and that a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and potentially peritoneal sampling would be the optimum form of treatment which should be offered as a single surgical procedure; (f) performing surgery in two stages was not recommended; (g) a diagnosis could not be offered prior to surgery and that it would be extremely difficult to place any restriction on surgery and that instead the surgeons performing the surgery should be free to do as they consider necessary at the time of surgery; (h) H&#8217;s physical and mental health are likely to improve if surgery is performed; (i) the surgical procedure will cause pain to H and she may well be distressed.  Such pain can be controlled with pain relief.  H is likely to require a catheter bag and intravenous drip for 2 days or so after surgery; (j) the management plan outlined by Dr A, the Consultant in Rehabilitation Psychiatry at Trust A, and Mr D is appropriate and reflects best practice.  Managing H on the High Dependency Unit post surgery with a member of her treating psychiatric staff present as required will ensure that appropriate treatment can be provided to her; (k)  H is unlikely to be a high risk patient with regard to anaesthesia and that the pre, per and post operative risks can be appropriately managed; (l) the removal of both ovaries would produce the onset of menopausal symptoms which could worsen H&#8217;s mental state but that this could be managed by HRT which would be the most appropriate in the form of topical cream which is applied daily; (m) H&#8217;s expressed desire to have children is unrealistic given her age; (n) it is not currently possible to say if post operative chemotherapy would be appropriate for H.  A provisional view is that secondary treatment would be very difficult to administer  against her wishes and is unlikely to be an appropriate course of action unless H consents; and (o) whether the cyst is benign, borderline or malignant, the correct medical intervention is the full surgery outlined at (e) above.</p>

His prognosis in terms of psychiatric care is that she will continue to require high level support in the community or she will remain in a rehabilitation unit such as the home where she presently is.  Dr A says that H cannot retain information presented to her in relation to her physical state and the need to remove the cyst.  She consistently fails to acknowledge the nature of her illness and the impact on her wellbeing.  She will reluctantly accept medication when her discomfort becomes unbearable but this is usually only after prompting from a member of staff.  Dr A believes that the reason given by H for refusing surgery, namely her wish to have children, is simply an excuse to avoid the operation and that she cannot make a decision  as to whether the cyst should be removed or not.  She is unable to weigh the information that has been given to her to arrive at a decision about medical treatment.  She has not been able to understand that surgery will remove her pain, shortness of breath and inability to eat or that it may well be required to save her life.  She is unable to acknowledge that she may well have cancer.  Nevertheless, he strongly believes that she is worried sick about the growth in her abdomen and the pain and distress which she currently experiences.  Dr A believes that she cannot avoid thinking about it as it is evidently physically causing her clothes to tent out and resulting in her experiencing pain and discomfort which affects her daily life.  He considered that the strength of her opposition to surgery is a reflection of how strongly she is worried about her condition.</p>

It is his view that H will co-operate once she has had the operation.  She has co-operated with staff at the C Centre where he proposes she should stay and that she has made no attempts to leave.  He proposes that when H is medically and surgically fit for discharge she will return home to recuperate.  Dr A is strongly of the view that there should be a single surgical procedure.  He warns that it is his belief that H will not co-operate with any treatment that she fears will be invasive, painful or result in any adverse side effects.  He therefore did not believe she will comply with chemotherapy or radiotherapy willingly.</p>

They confirm that they both agree H lacks capacity to refuse or consent to medical treatment for her ovarian cyst and gynaecological condition and it is unlikely that she will acquire this capacity in the near future.  They agree that in the event that histopathological testing shows that H is suffering from cancer, she does not have capacity to make decisions about cancer treatment, including whether to accept or refuse radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and that H will require long-term psychiatric care with a high level of support either in a rehabilitation unit or in the community.  They both consider that psychotropic medication will not positively affect her capacity to consent, either to medical treatment for her cyst and gynaecological condition, or possible cancer treatment nor is it likely to reduce the stress she would probably associate with it.</p>

They are agreed that undergoing the surgical procedure proposed is unlikely to cause H distress or impact on her mental health or mood in any significant way.  She is likely to experience transient anxiety associated with understandable fear of anaesthetic and surgical procedure, which they describe as a normal response.  They anticipate that she may experience some distress at the acute menopausal symptoms which could be caused, but believe that this could be minimised by the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT).  They do not consider H&#8217;s desire to have children to be a genuinely held desire.  She will thus not be caused lasting distress if she undergoes the surgery proposed.  They conclude by stating that it is not possible at this stage to advise whether or not oncological treatment regime consisting of radiotherapy and /or chemotherapy will be appropriate and in H&#8217;s best interests.  This should only be addressed once the histology, staging of the tumour and prognosis have been confirmed.  Both consider it unlikely that H would be agreeable or compliant to such treatment regimes and that it would be extremely difficult to enforce this treatment.</p>

He too regards it as preferable for H to undergo the full surgical procedure recommended.  If, as is likely, the cyst is cancerous, there is a possibility that no further treatment will be required if it is completely removed.  If this is not so, then secondary treatment by some form of chemotherapy will be desirable.  He acknowledges the difficulty with regard to offering secondary treatment to a patient who is unwilling to accept it, but considers none the less that surgical intervention is the appropriate course in the patient&#8217;s present condition.  The assessment of Mr Kenney is that without surgery H is unlikely to survive beyond six months and could well die sooner in any event.</p>

Similarly, all are agreed that she lacks capacity to make decisions about her medical treatment for her ovarian cyst and gynaecological condition.  Further, the Official Solicitor has proffered to the court a long and careful statement accepting these opinions.  He also believes it to be in the best interest of H that if , as expected, she continues to withhold consent to operative treatment, she should be sedated for that purpose and that, if necessary, there should be use of reasonable physical restraint in order to administer pre and post-operative treatment.</p>

A person lacks capacity if some impairment or disturbance of mental functioning renders that person unable to make a decision whether to consent or refuse treatment.  Such inability occurs when either the patient is unable to comprehend and retain the   material relevant to the decision, especially the likely consequences of having or not having the treatment in question, or where the patient is unable to use the information and weigh it in the balance as part of the process at arriving at a decision.  In this respect a compulsive disorder or phobia may prevent the patient&#8217;s decision from being a true one, particularly if conditioned by some obsessional belief or feeling which so distorts the judgment as to render the decision invalid.</p>

Whether consciously or sub-consciously it is advanced and a rationalisation for an objection to an operative procedure to which she is fearful.  At the same time, it is clear from a number of observations that she does not appreciate the seriousness of her condition and the sense of threat to life which it presents if unalleviated by such surgery.  I am thus satisfied that H lacks capacity to makes decisions about her medical treatment for her ovarian cyst and gynaecological condition.</p>

If, as seems likely, the cyst is malignant, the preferred surgical procedure is essential.  Depending on the type and stage of the cancer, it may be curative.  Even if it is not curative it will offer H a better chance for long life and better quality than if it is not performed.

Although she is bound to be in pain and to some extent distress post-operatively such pain and distress can be effectively controlled with pain relief.  The urinary catheter and intravenous infusion drip which will be required for two days post-operatively is of no particular discomfort.  H may experience transient distress at the loss of her ability to have children (if she is fertile) however, because of the view of the psychiatrist that her stated desires to have more children are defensive rather than genuine such distress is not likely to be substantial or lasting.  Finally, although loss of both ovaries may well produce sudden onset of menopausal symptoms which, unalleviated, could worsen H&#8217;s mental state, they can be managed by HRT administered by way of topical cream daily.</p>
