The question for me is whether that belief is well-founded. In my judgment, and with all respect to those of my brethren who have taken a different view, it is not.</p>

The reason is simple: the commissioning parents were unaware of the need to apply for a parental order, let alone of the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54</ref>.</p>

On 1 December 2013 they confirmed that their wishes and feelings about relinquishing parental rights and responsibilities remained the same. The order made on 6 January 2014 by His Honour Judge Plunkett (see below) recites that the surrogate parents have &#8220;clearly&#8221; and &#8220;unequivocally&#8221; relinquished and surrendered all parental rights in respect of X.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is correctly common ground that the expert evidence before me demonstrates that the surrogacy agreement was valid under Indian law and that under Indian law the surrogate father and the surrogate mother, being married, are treated as X&#8217;s parents to the exclusion of both the commissioning father and the commissioning mother. That is also the position under English law: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/35" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 35</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>. It follows from this that the surrogate father and surrogate mother have parental responsibility for X under English law. The commissioning father and commissioning mother do not; in fact under English law they have no rights at all. The surrogate parents are X&#8217;s parents &#8220;for all purposes&#8221;: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/48/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 48(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>. It is also correctly common ground that the surrogate parents are, in law, unable to transfer or surrender parental responsibility for X. If the commissioning parents are to acquire parental rights or parental responsibility for X they need an order of the court.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What the commissioning parents want, and what on the face of it X&#8217;s best interests plainly demand, is an order permanently extinguishing all the legal rights and responsibilities of the surrogate parents and permanently vesting all such rights and responsibilities in the commissioning parents. There are only two ways in which, in principle, such an outcome can be achieved: an adoption order made in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/46" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 46</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> or a parental order made in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>. Adoption is not an attractive solution given the commissioning father&#8217;s existing biological relationship with X. As X&#8217;s guardian puts it, a parental order presents the optimum legal and psychological solution for X and is preferable to an adoption order because it confirms the important legal, practical and psychological reality of X&#8217;s identity: the commissioning father is his biological father and all parties intended from the outset that the commissioning parents should be his legal parents. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In June 2013 the commissioning parents separated. They remained separated, but not divorced, until June 2014 when they became reconciled. On 9 July 2013 the commissioning father issued an application in the Birmingham County Court for a residence order in respect of X. The case was listed before Her Honour Judge Hindley QC on 19 July 2013. Judge Hindley drew attention to the omission to apply for a parental order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54</ref> and to the fact that neither of the commissioning parents had parental responsibility. She transferred the case to the High Court and made X a ward of court. She made an order the effect of which was to split X&#8217;s living arrangements between the commissioning parents at their separate homes. Those arrangements, endorsed by subsequent orders of the court, remained in place until June 2014, since which time X has lived together with both commissioning parents. Further hearings took place before his Honour Judge Plunkett, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court, on 12 September 2013, 19 September 2013, 7 November 2013 and 6 January 2014.</p>

Hedley J was considering an application by the commissioning father for the revocation of a parental order on the grounds (para 11) that, first, the order had been wrongly made by reason of numerous procedural defects and, secondly, it had been obtained by a concealment by the commissioning mother of a fact &#8211; that she was intending to leave him and raise the child as a lone parent &#8211; which, if known, would, according to the commissioning father, have resulted in no order being made. Hedley J refused the application, essentially on the ground (paras 29-30, 33) that a parental order, like an adoption order, confers a lifelong status and inalienable parental responsibility to the permanent exclusion of those who until then had parental status, and that, there being no statutory power to set aside a parental order, the court considering such an application should therefore be guided by the authorities on revoking adoption orders.

In the case of statutes that are said to be imperative, the Courts have decided that if it is not done the whole thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all void. On the other hand, when the Courts hold a provision to be mandatory or directory, they say that, although such provision may not have been complied with, the subsequent proceedings do not fail. Still, whatever the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one. There may be many provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they are not strictly obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material importance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the legislature could have intended that the non-observance of them should be followed by a total failure of the whole proceedings. On the other hand, there are some provisions in respect of which the Court would take an opposite view, and would feel that they are matters which must be strictly obeyed, otherwise the whole proceedings that subsequently follow must come to an end. Now the question is, to which category does the provision in question in this case belong?</p>

It has been the source of a great deal of litigation. In the course of the last 130 years a distinction evolved between mandatory and directory requirements. The view was taken that where the requirement is mandatory, a failure to comply with it invalidates the act in question. Where it is merely directory, a failure to comply does not invalidate what follows. There were refinements. For example, a distinction was made between two types of directory requirements, namely (1) requirements of a purely regulatory character where a failure to comply would never invalidate the act, and (2) requirements where a failure to comply would not invalidate an act provided that there was substantial compliance.&#8221;</p>

But this does not mean that her duty is to return by then or not at all. Rather, even if she fails to meet your deadline, she still remains under a duty to return home. On the other hand, if you contract with a conjuror to perform at your daughter&#8217;s birthday party, you want the conjuror and his tricks only for the party. His duty is accordingly limited to performing at the party held on your daughter's birthday and, if he fails to turn up, he cannot discharge the duty later. In the present cases Parliament has placed the court under a duty, where appropriate, to make a confiscation order before it sentences an offender. If the court fails to do so and proceeds to sentence the offender first, does Parliament intend that &#8211; like your daughter &#8211; the court should remain under a duty to make the order? Or does Parliament intend that the duty should be limited so that &#8211; like the conjuror &#8211; the court can perform it only before sentencing?&#8221;</p>

It intended short and firm time limits, but can only have done so on the basis that this would in practice suffice to enable anyone wishing to appeal to do so without difficulty in time. In these circumstances, I consider that &#8230; the statutory provisions concerning appeals can and should all be read subject to the qualification that the court must have a discretion in exceptional circumstances to extend time &#8230; where such statutory provisions would otherwise operate to prevent an appeal in a manner conflicting with the right of access to an appeal process held to exist under article 6.1 in <span style="font-style:italic">Tolstoy Miloslavsky</span> [<span style="font-style:italic">Tolstoy Miloslavsky v United Kingdom</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1995) 20 EHRR 442" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">(1995) 20 EHRR 442</ref>]. The High Court must have power in any individual case to determine whether the operation of the time limits would have this effect. If and to the extent that it would do so, it must have power to permit and hear an out of time appeal which a litigant personally has done all he can to bring &#8230; timeously.&#8221;</p>

There is good reason for there to be time limits with a high degree of strictness. However, one only has to consider hypothetical cases to appreciate that, without some margin for discretion, circumstances may cause absolute time limits to impair &#8220;the very essence&#8221; of the right of appeal conferred by statute. Take, for example, a case in which a person, having received a decision removing him or her from the register, immediately succumbs to serious illness and remains in intensive care; or a case in which notice of the disciplinary decision has been sent by post but never arrives and time begins to run by reason of deemed service on the day after it was sent &#8230; In such cases, the nurse or midwife in question might remain in blameless ignorance of the fact that time was running for the whole of the 28-day period. It seems to me that to take the absolute approach in such circumstances would be to allow the time limit to impair the very essence of the statutory right of appeal.&#8221;</p>

Parliament is used to providing such discretions, often circumscribed by conditions &#8230; The omission to do so on this occasion was no doubt deliberate. If article 6 and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref> require [the statutory provision] to be read down, it must be to the minimum extent necessary to secure compliance with Convention.

It is central to his being, whether as an individual or as a member of his family. As Ms Isaacs correctly puts it, this case is fundamentally about Xs identity and his relationship with the commissioning parents. Fundamental as these matters must be to commissioning parents they are, if anything, even more fundamental to the child. A parental order has, to adopt Theis J&#8217;s powerful expression, a transformative effect, not just in its effect on the child&#8217;s legal relationships with the surrogate and commissioning parents but also, to adopt the guardian&#8217;s words in the present case, in relation to the practical and psychological realities of X&#8217;s identity. A parental order, like an adoption order, has an effect extending far beyond the merely legal. It has the most profound personal, emotional, psychological, social and, it may be in some cases, cultural and religious, consequences. It creates what Thorpe LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (Adoption: Non-Patrial)</span> [1998] INLR 424, 429, referred to as &#8220;the psychological relationship of parent and child with all its far-reaching manifestations and consequences.&#8221; Moreover, these consequences are lifelong and, for all practical purposes, irreversible: see <span style="font-style:italic">G v G (Parental Order: Revocation) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2012/1979" uk:canonical="[2012] EWHC 1979 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWHC 1979 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 1 FLR 286" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 1 FLR 286</ref>, to which I have already referred.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Where in the light of all this does the six-month period specified in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(3)</ref> stand? Can Parliament really have intended that the gate should be barred forever if the application for a parental order is lodged even one day late? I cannot think so. Parliament has not explained its thinking, but given the transcendental importance of a parental order, with its consequences stretching many, many decades into the future, can it sensibly be thought that Parliament intended the difference between six months and six months and one day to be determinative and one day&#8217;s delay to be fatal? I assume that Parliament intended a sensible result. Given the subject matter, given the consequences for the commissioning parents, never mind those for the child, to construe <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(3)</ref> as barring forever an application made just one day late is not, in my judgment, sensible. It is the very antithesis of sensible; it is almost nonsensical. It is, after all, easy to imagine far from fanciful circumstances in which the application arrives too late: the solicitor misunderstands <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(3)</ref> and excludes the day on which the child was born from his calculation of when time runs out; the solicitor&#8217;s legal executive is delayed by a broken down train or a traffic jam and arrives at the court office just after it has closed; on the way to their solicitor&#8217;s office to give instructions the commissioning parents are involved in a car crash that leaves them both in a coma from which they recover only after the six-month period has elapsed. Why should they be barred? Even more to the point, why should the wholly innocent child be barred by such mishap? Let it be assumed, though in truth, and with all respect to her, this is little more than speculation, that the underlying policy is that identified by Eleanor King J in <span style="font-style:italic">JP v LP and others</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/595" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 595 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 595 (Fam)</ref>, namely to provide for the speedy consensual regularisation of the legal parental status of a child&#8217;s carers following a birth resulting from a surrogacy arrangement; that policy surely does not require <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(3)</ref> to be read as meaning that <span style="font-style:italic">any </span>delay, however trivial, is to be fatal. One can see why Eleanor King J was concerned that there should not be what she referred to as delay over &#8220;a protracted period&#8221;, but that is a different point. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other point is this. Theis J focussed on that aspect of Article 8 which protects &#8220;family life&#8221;, but Article 8 also protects &#8220;private life&#8221;, and &#8216;identity&#8217;, on which she appropriately laid stress, is an important aspect of &#8220;private life&#8221;. So, any application for a parental order implicates both the child&#8217;s right to &#8220;family life&#8221; and also the child&#8217;s right to &#8220;private life&#8221;. The distinction does not matter in the circumstances of the present case (see further below) but I make the point because it is, I suppose, possible to conceive of a case where, on the facts, it might be more difficult or even impossible to demonstrate the existence of &#8220;family life.&#8221;   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This period in fact falls into two parts: first, the period from December 2011, when X was born, until July 2013, when Judge Hindley first drew attention to the significance of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54</ref>; second, the period thereafter until the application was issued in February 2014. In the particular circumstances of this case, the latter period, in my judgment, properly falls out of account. Until Ms Isaacs suggested otherwise in January 2014, everyone &#8211; the parties&#8217; legal advisers and the judges dealing with the case &#8211; were agreed that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(3)</ref> presented an insuperable obstacle. And that was hardly surprising given the decisions of Hedley J and Theis J referred to in paragraph 21 above. So the true focus must be on the period of thirteen months delay from June 2012, when the six month period expired, until the hearing before Judge Hindley in July 2013.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In one sense that is a long time, both in absolute terms and when compared with the statutory time limit of six months. And it is a very long time indeed compared with the matter of a few days that were fatal to the appellant in <span style="font-style:italic">Adesina v Nursing and Midwifery Council</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/818" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 818" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 818</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 1 WLR 3156" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 1 WLR 3156</ref>.

I repeat in this context what I have already said in paragraphs 54-56 above. There are, without labouring the point, three aspects of a parental order which very obviously and very fundamentally distinguish it from the kind of case which the court was concerned with in <span style="font-style:italic">Adesina</span>. The first is that a parental order goes not just status but to identity as a human being. The second is that the court is looking, indeed is required by statute to look, to a future stretching many, many decades into the future. The third is that the court is concerned not just with the impact on the applicant whose default in meeting the time limit is being scrutinised but also with the impact on the innocent child, whose welfare is the court&#8217;s paramount concern. In these circumstances the court is entitled, indeed in my judgment it is bound, to adopt a more liberal and relaxed approach than was appropriate in <span style="font-style:italic">Adesina</span>. After all, as Maurice Kay LJ recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">Adesina</span>, what the court is required to do, albeit it is required to do no more, is to secure compliance with the Convention. I would not be doing that if I were to deny the commissioning parents and X access to the court.</p>

This total comprised three elements: 100,000 rupees (&#163;1,250) paid to a &#8220;mediator&#8221; whose &#8220;role was to locate an appropriate woman to act as a surrogate&#8221;; 200,000 rupees (&#163;2,500) paid to the surrogate mother &#8220;to act as surrogate &#8230; paid in instalments&#8221;; and 250,000 rupees (&#163;3,125) paid to the clinic as &#8220;fees&#8221;, covering all testing, IVF treatment and the delivery &#8211; in the obstetric sense &#8211; of X.

For present purposes I propose to proceed on the footing that, whatever view might be taken about the nature and quantum of the other two payments, the payment to the &#8220;mediator&#8221; falls foul of the statutory prohibition. The question then is whether I should nonetheless authorise these payments.</p>

It is, say Ms Isaacs and Mr Maynard, plainly in X&#8217;s interests for the commissioning parents, with one or other of whom he has lived for almost all of his short life, to be recognised in law as his legal parents, now and for his entire life. It cannot, they say, be in his interests for the surrogate parents to retain any form of legal right or responsibility in relation to him. I agree. The guardian&#8217;s report is very positive. X is much loved and well cared for, he is happy and settled in the care of the commissioning parents. The guardian has no concerns and recommends the making of a parental order. I agree.</p>
