The approach in law is that set out by Lord Steyn in Re S and in respect of the requirement for 'compelling reasons' the judgment in A v Ward must be regarded as per incuriam and should not be followed. In accordance with Re S, there should be no default position, or requirement for 'compelling reasons', in such cases. Any such application should turn on its own facts, including the overall context, where that is made out, as to the significant negative impact that the unrestricted and general identification of treating clinicians and staff may generate&#8221;</span></p>

They start with his report being signed, although it is a digital signature. It contained no indication it was provisional. Next, he undertook an experts discussion with [Professor AM] based upon their respective reports. Finally, he entered the witness box, stated the evidence he was going to give &#8220;shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth&#8221;, and then confirmed the contents of his report were true to the best of his knowledge and belief, without qualification. His evidence was given over more than one day. At no point did he indicate his report was &#8220;provisional&#8221;, despite being specifically asked about access to the medical records.</span></p>

Decisions are not works of art and can always be improved upon with time. Almost inevitably, following the cut and thrust of cross-examination, the decision will end up providing only part of what occurred. What is important is that it is a fair reflection of what occurred and sets out the reasoning for the decision made. The Court agrees the wording at part of the decision can be made clearer and is circulating separately a proposed change to the advocates for all parties to that end.</span></p>

A decision provided by a court is a balance of the arguments and information. It cannot contain everything, but must contain enough to make sense of what was being argued. The Local authority relied upon the expert evidence to make their case and the parents challenged the expert evidence, as was their right to do. Omitting relevant submissions would potentially detract from the weight of what occurred and skew any understanding of the reasoning. Context is key, and it is very hard for the Court to say somebody did not do something they were accused of without saying what they were accused of. The Court is entitled to assume some level of understanding of any readership, particularly any professional readership, and an acceptance that they will not approach the matter on a &#8220;no smoke without fire&#8221; basis.</span></p>

Sadly, it seems to be commonplace in modern society, where information can spread around the world in seconds and commentators can mis-report information simply to increase readership. However, the public interest in a &#8216;right to life&#8217; and the polar views that may apply (the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt">Abbasi</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:11pt"> case) are likely to be far different to a case about whether a child has sustained accidental injury.
