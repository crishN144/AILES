Without any objection, or even demur, by or on behalf of either party, I&#160;heard the whole of this case in public, save for a period of about five minutes when I&#160;very briefly went into private to touch upon a sensitive matter personal to the parties.  I&#160;now give this judgment in public.  It may be freely reported, but no report of, or relating to, this judgment may name the children (whose names I&#160;will not disclose), nor their home addresses or school.</span></p>

I&#160;hope that each party will respectively feel that his/her case could not have been better presented.  I&#160;also wish to thank both parties themselves for their patience, close attention and, so far as possible, good humour during the course of the hearing.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The law, as developed by the courts, recognises that there is an analytical distinction between so-called matrimonial and non-matrimonial (including pre-marital) property or assets, and that that distinction may, and often will, impact upon discretionary distribution after divorce.  In the present case, the husband already owned before the cohabitation and marriage publicly quoted shares in a company of which he was a co-founder and the chief executive officer.  He still owns most of them.  When the parties began their relationship and cohabitation those shares were trading at around 12 to 8p each (the parties differing as to the precise month in which cohabitation began).  When the parties finally separated, the shares were trading at around &#163;67 each.  At one point since the separation the shares were trading at as high as about &#163;70 each.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The agreed market price of the shares for the purpose of this hearing and judgment is &#163;29.09 each (being their value during 25 February 2016).  I&#160;mention that even during the course of the hearing they rose as high as &#163;31 each, thereby adding nearly &#163;14&#160;million to the gross wealth at that moment of the husband.  (Partly for that reason I&#160;will generally use rounded figures in this judgment.  When the combined assets of the parties may rise or fall by several millions of pounds, even as they are sitting in the court room, it is petty and pedantic in judgment to use very precise figures, although that is how they appear in the agreed asset schedule.)</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The central issue in the case is how the value of those shares should be treated by me, and to what extent the wife should share in their value.  A slightly complicating feature is that since the separation the husband has sold some of the shares and invested the proceeds in three properties in Wimbledon, purchased in his sole name, whose aggregate net value is about &#163;20.1&#160;million.  The husband says that the remaining shares and also those three properties are non-matrimonial assets, and that the wife should not share in them or their value at all.  </span></p>

But she says that the balance of their value (representing so-called active growth during the period of the cohabitation and marriage) should be divided equally between the parties on the sharing principle, being, she contends, matrimonial assets.  The accountant&#8217;s assessment of the net value of the shares uprated for passive growth since June/July 2002 (when the wife contends they began to cohabit) is about &#163;4.84 million.  The bottom line total of all the net assets on the agreed asset schedule (i.e. the combined total net wealth of these parties) is about &#163;219.5 million.  </span></p>

The husband contends that, strictly, the wife should retain or receive assets to the value of &#163;29.2 million, being half of &#163;219.5 million less the sum of &#163;141&#160;million (the net value of the remaining shares) and &#163;20.1 million (the net value of the three Wimbledon properties purchased from share sales since separation).  The husband has, in fact, agreed that the wife should retain or receive assets to the net value of &#163;30.26 million.</span></p>

The gap between the parties is about &#163;77 million (&#163;107.33 million less &#163;30.26 million). </span></p>

I&#160;have pointed out the high element of litigation risk when each is taking these relatively extreme, polarised and hard edged positions.   But no compromise has resulted.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">There is very little material dispute as to the material facts, and I&#160;can summarise them fairly shortly.  The husband is now aged 48.  The wife is now aged 43.  They first met in the summer of 2002, having been introduced by Lorri Penn (see below), who was already employed by the husband&#8217;s company.  There is a dispute as to whether they rapidly began to live together in about June/July 2002, as the wife contends, or in September 2002, as the husband contends.  Nothing turns on whether the cohabitation was about two months longer or shorter, and wisely neither leading counsel asked questions about this issue.  Accordingly, I&#160;make no finding as to the precise month in which cohabitation began.  Paradoxically, the husband&#8217;s shares were trading in June/July 2002 at about 12p each, higher than in September when they were trading at about 8p each.  Since the wife is the applicant and it is her case that they began to cohabit in June/July, I&#160;will assume (favourably to the husband but consistent with the wife&#8217;s case) that at the start of cohabitation the shares were trading at about 12p each.</span></p>

They have two daughters, now aged eight and seven, who were born less than a year apart, so the wife became pregnant for the second time only about two months after giving birth the first time. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Very sadly the marriage broke down.  Each party no doubt has their own perspective of the reasons for that, which are touched upon in the written evidence, but they are immaterial to outcome.  The wife did say in her oral evidence that they were largely living what she called &#8220;separate lives&#8221; in 2011, but they struggled on and indeed undertook counselling in late 2012.  During 2013 they were still living under the same roof, and indeed during 2013 several investment properties were purchased in joint names.  The parties finally separated around the end of 2013.  This was thus a cohabitation and marriage of about ten to eleven years&#8217; duration.  Both had grounds for divorce, but it was the wife who petitioned for divorce in May 2014 and the present proceedings ensued.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The parties were relatively mature people when they first met, the husband being then aged 34, and the wife 29.  When they met, the wife had a small start-up business of her own, but it was struggling and she was, as she said in her oral evidence, having difficulties servicing the mortgage upon her flat.  So the husband bought the flat from her with a large mortgage and let it out.  She moved into his rented flat.  At the point when they began to cohabit, the wife therefore had negligible means. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In 1996 the husband, whose earlier background had been working in advertising, founded a company called Entertainment Marketing (EM) jointly with a man called Quentin Griffiths, whom he had met at a business event.  The business of EM was &#8220;product placement&#8221;, which essentially involves getting the client&#8217;s branded product, whether it be a pair of sunglasses or a car or a foodstuff, used in films or on television, thereby promoting the product.  EM was successful, but quite soon the husband and Quentin Griffiths identified another business opportunity which the husband calls effectively &#8220;the other side of the same coin&#8221;, namely selling online to the public products which they have seen on film or television.  For this purpose, they created a new company, As Seen On Screen Limited (now called ASOS, to which for convenience I&#160;will refer to it from the outset).  The business was launched online in about May 2000.  </span></p>

Although the nature of the business was different, there is an evolutionary stream from the first launch of EM in 1996.  During 2000 ASOS recruited a lady, Lorri Penn, whose background was in fashion with the well known retail group, Arcadia, and she was clearly a significant influence upon the decision of ASOS to focus upon selling clothes and fashion, and to shed selling other household products and items.  </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">ASOS was floated on the AIM of the London Stock Exchange in October 2001, still many months before these parties met.  It floated at 20p per share, valuing the company as a whole at about &#163;12.3 million.  As already indicated, that price was later to fall to about 12p per share in July 2002, 8p in September 2002, and later during 2003 to as low as about 4p.  When the parties began to cohabit (in whichever month it was), the husband owned about 9.9 million of the issued shares in ASOS, or about 16 per cent.  In June 2002 those shares were theoretically worth about &#163;1.2 million gross, although he could not  realistically have sold them.  The husband was already the CEO of the company, a position he was to retain until he resigned in September 2015. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The private financial situation of the husband was that he lived in a rented flat.  He had a fairly old Mercedes car.  He described themselves in his oral evidence as &#8220;a normal couple starting out on life&#8221;.  During 2003 the husband was able to buy a house in Fulham with a large mortgage and help from his parents.  By the time of the marriage, he had a new Porsche car and was able to fund the costs of the wedding and an exotic honeymoon on Bora Bora.  During 2005 he was able to buy the chalet which the parties still own in Chamonix.  So the husband&#8217;s prosperity was rising, but it was still dwarfed by the later success and wealth.</span></p>

But I&#160;accept, as table 1 at bundle 2, p.G44, indicates, that the major growth did not begin until about 2010, well after the date of the marriage.  The husband received salary, bonuses, and share options and grants as his remuneration as CEO.  A schedule headed &#8220;Share Sales Valuation&#8221; was produced for the hearing which shows the dates upon which shares were later sold and their estimated net proceeds.  In the period from February 2007 to October 2013, the husband exercised options and sold the option shares, granted shares and some of his pre-existing shares.  He realised in total an estimated net &#163;73 million, of which about &#163;11.5 million net was from the sale of his original shares pre-existing before the parties ever met, and &#163;61.5&#160;million was from options and grants earned during the marriage.  The husband suggested during his oral evidence that, very roughly, the averaged annualised aggregate net value of share options and grants received and realised by him (but excluding pre-existing shares) plus his net salary, was not less than about &#163;6 million per&#160;annum during the period of cohabitation and marriage.  He says, therefore, that he was very well remunerated for his very hard work and entrepreneurial skill during the course of the marriage, and that the wife has shared, and will now share, equally in the fruits of that work.  The proceeds of the share sales during the marriage were spent in part on family living expenses, but largely invested in properties, funds and other assets, which he unreservedly agrees to share equally with the wife.  </span></p>

The valuable shares which the husband now owns in ASOS (and the shares which he recently sold with which to purchase the three Wimbledon properties) are the residue of precisely the same shares that he already owned in ASOS some two or more years before he even met the wife.  They are, accordingly, non-matrimonial property.  Mr&#160;Cohen and Miss&#160;Murray readily agree that the share options exercised and grants received during the course of the marriage were matrimonial property, being part of the husband&#8217;s remuneration package or rewards whilst the marriage was in being.

This results in his conclusion that the gross value of the shares as at 13 January 2016 (the date of the report) is &#163;6.7 million, allowing for passive growth since June 2002, and &#163;4.9 million, allowing for passive growth since September 2002, resulting in net figures of &#163;4.84 million and &#163;3.56 million respectively.</span></p>

In </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Miller</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> the parties married in July 2000 (there was no prior cohabitation).  At that date the husband was actually still employed as an asset manager by a firm called Jupiter (owned by Commerzbank).  There was a gentlemen&#8217;s agreement between the husband and a man called John Duffield that the husband would join Mr Duffield in a new company to be formed and to be called New Star Asset Management.  The husband actually joined New Star in January 2001 (viz several months </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt">after</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> the marriage), at which point he purchased 200,000 shares in New Star for &#163;200,000.  Although the judge was later to describe the value of the husband&#8217;s New Star shares as &#8220;inestimable&#8221;, and their future value &#8220;unfathomable&#8221;, it is clear from paragraph 49 of the judgment of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead that by the time of the hearing before the judge the shares had a latent value of many millions of pounds, there being references to &#163;12 million and &#163;18 million for the whole, and to a likely sale price of &#163;6 million for 75,000 out of the total holding of 200,000.  So in the space of about three years, all during the marriage or in the period before trial, the husband had first acquired the shares, and they had increased in value from &#163;200,000 to many millions of pounds of the above order.  The shares could not possibly have been pre-marital or non-matrimonial, for New Star did not even exist at the date of the marriage (see Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead at paragraph 70).

In the present case, Mr Miller already had, at the marriage date, real connections in the form of the Jupiter funds which he later took to New Star and real prospects under the gentlemen&#8217;s agreement made with Mr&#160;Duffield of acquiring, as he subsequently did, valuable shares in New Star.  I&#160;would regard these as real contributions brought into the marriage, which should on any view be taken into account accordingly.&#8221;</span></p>

In the earlier years of the marriage it was not particularly high.  As the husband said, they were a normal couple, starting out on life, living first in a rented flat;  then moving to a small, heavily mortgaged owned house;  then trading up to a better house;  and so on, until they acquired the large and valuable final matrimonial home in August 2010, by which time the husband was able to raise large sums from share sales.  They began with an old Mercedes.  They now have a fleet of cars, including Range Rovers, a Bentley, and a Ferrari.  Fairly early in their marriage they bought, in 2005, and have always enjoyed a commodious chalet in Chamonix, both being keen skiers.  Later in 2008, they bought their farmhouse in Oxfordshire.  It cost &#163;1.75 million.  It is now valued at &#163;3.2 million net.  They have a motor yacht with four crew in the South of France.  It was from about 2010 that the husband was able to make large sales of shares, and from about that time that the standard of living became high, as indicated by, for example, travel by hired private jet.</span></p>

It was recently confirmed as the best performing share in the 20 year life of the AIM.  It now employs over 3,000 people in the UK alone.  It has generated phenomenal capital growth for the shareholders, including the husband, who has only ever had a relatively small minority share.  ASOS as a company has won a very long list of awards, almost all of them since the start of cohabitation, as set out by the husband in the schedule to his <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> statement, now at bundle 1, pp.D154 to 157.  The husband, personally, has won the prestigious awards listed at paragraph 30 of that statement, now at bundle 1, pp.D140 to 141.  These include several awards as &#8220;Entrepreneur of the Year&#8221;.  He has apparently been described by the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Daily Telegraph</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> newspaper as &#8220;one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the 20</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> century&#8221;, although that seems a little surprising since his achievements belong more to the 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> century than to the 20</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt">.

As I&#160;have already quoted, the husband agreed in his oral evidence that during their marriage they had been &#8220;a team&#8221;, in which he was the money maker and she was &#8220;an excellent home-maker&#8221;, and &#8220;an excellent mother and still is&#8221;.  He agreed in his evidence that the wife ran the family life effectively, while he was very effective at money making.  That was the &#8220;partnership&#8221; they had.

For many years now the wife has employed and continues to employ a lady whom I&#160;will call L.  There is a wrangle between the parties in the written evidence, carried over briefly into the oral evidence, as to whether L was (or is) a &#8220;nanny&#8221;, as the husband alleges, or a &#8220;housekeeper&#8221;, as the wife prefers to describe her.  I&#160;regard this as completely irrelevant to this point.  It is an obvious feature of cases and families with higher resources that some staff may be employed.  It is nit-picking whether that staff (to put it pictorially) wash the dishes while the mother changes the nappies, or change the nappies while the mother washes the dishes.  I&#160;completely reject that the wife of a successful and high earning husband should somehow receive less just because his success has enabled staff to be employed, if, as in this case, the wife remained an excellent home-maker and an excellent mother.</span></p>

Although there was a major, or even total, change of direction between the business and product of EM and that of ASOS, as it finally evolved, the fact remains that the husband jointly with Quentin Griffiths first began in business on his own account in 1996.  I&#160;accept his evidence that ASOS was able to launch utilising the funds, staff, IT and infrastructure of EM, which was already an established and profitable company.  Although the husband and his colleagues may not have appreciated how use of the internet would grow and its full potential, they had clearly tapped into it and its potential before these parties ever even met.  The focus on fashion had clearly begun, evidenced by the recruitment of Lorri Penn.  Many key decisions had already been taken before these parties first met, including the decisions to specialise as an online business alone, and to establish its own in-house website.  </span></p>

Mr&#160;Bishop and Mr&#160;Bradley produced a written list of twenty &#8220;management decisions&#8221;  under a heading &#8220;The active management decisions which grew ASOS as identified in the SJE&#8217;s  report&#8221;, being decisions taken during the period of the cohabitation and marriage.  These were not decisions taken by the husband alone.  They were part of the management of the company by a large and expanding team, albeit led by him as CEO.  As CEO and an employee of the company, the husband was, in any event, well remunerated with salary and additional shares, in which the wife has shared and will equally share.  </span></p>

But, in my view, the pre-existing shares cannot, in fairness to the wife, be carved out and left out of account altogether.  They were not simply left in a drawer, to use a metaphor used during the course of the argument.   They were part of the backdrop of the whole matrimonial economy;  and to borrow words from Baroness Hale of Richmond in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Miller</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> quoted in paragraph 27 above, they were part of &#8220;the way the couple have run their lives&#8221;.  </span></p>

He sold pre-existing shares for an estimated net &#163;1.57&#160;million in July 2008, shortly before the purchase of the house in Oxfordshire.  He sold more pre-existing shares for an estimated &#163;10&#160;million net in July 2010, shortly before the parties bought the final matrimonial home.  Although his and his alone, the shares were part of the family economy which the husband was quite willing to draw upon and spend for the family as a whole.  They cannot accurately be described as &#8220;ring fenced&#8221;, as Mr&#160;Cohen submitted.  </span></p>

For this purpose I&#160;will depart from rounding and use the precise figures with which the parties themselves have chosen to describe their means in the agreed joint asset schedule.  One half of the net value of the remaining ASOS shares is &#163;70,418,990.  One half of the net value of the three investment properties in Wimbledon is &#163;10,066,875.  The sum of those two figures is &#163;80,485,865.  That figure must be deducted from the grand total of all assets and liabilities of &#163;219,500,679.  The difference is &#163;139,014,814.  That sum must be divided equally, yielding &#163;69,507,407, which I&#160;assess as the overall entitlement of the wife on the sharing principle, the balance belonging to the husband.</span></p>

It so happens that the resulting overall figure accords to the wife 31.66 per cent of the overall net assets, which happens to approximate to one-third.

I, personally, consider that there is nevertheless a distinction between an award which is arbitrary in the true sense, and one which is the product of judicial discretion.  An arbitrary result would be one yielded by sticking in a pin, or tossing a coin, or drawing a lot.  Judicial discretion is the product of a weighing of all relevant factors and wise, considered and informed decision making by an experienced adjudicator after hearing argument.  My decision is a discretionary one, but it is not an arbitrary one.</span></p>
