Ms Jones did not seek to renew her application on behalf of the Mother to adduce expert evidence on the possible impact on the two boys of a return to Australia.  However, as I was hearing oral evidence from the parents on the issues of consent and acquiescence she did invite me to permit the parents to be asked about the effect that the Father&#8217;s proposals for the children&#8217;s return could have on A&#8217;s condition, given the Mother&#8217;s current position that she cannot accompany the children if I order their return to Australia.  I permitted brief oral evidence to be adduced on this point and I also allowed some limited further evidence to put into context text messages between A and the Mother dating from July 2019 which had been disclosed very shortly before the hearing. </p>

In any event C was born in 2016, and by June 2016 (at the very latest) the parents&#8217; relationship had permanently come to an end. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Thereafter the children lived with the Mother, but had direct contact with the Father.  One of the issues in this case is the level of involvement which the Father has had in the children&#8217;s lives.  It is clear that the Mother considers that the Father has not shouldered his share of responsibility for the parenting of the children.  Indeed in her original Answer to this application she asserted that the alleged retention should not be considered wrongful within the meaning of Art. 3 of the Convention because the Father was not actually exercising rights of custody in relation to the children.  This point was, sensibly, in the light of the evidence, dropped by the Mother prior to the final hearing.  However, the issue has coloured aspects of the Mother&#8217;s evidence, and in particular her first witness statement in which she sought to minimise the role that the Father played in the children&#8217;s lives referring to his &#8220;delinquency&#8221; as a parent.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The Father&#8217;s case is that once he began his new relationship it became harder to organise his time with the children.  He responded by providing a significant number of photographs demonstrating that he nonetheless had had regular contact with the children.  The photographs exhibited cover the period from March 2019 to January 2020 and show him with all three children in a number of situations; sports matches, restaurant meals, a school awards ceremony and, in the case of C, a day out at a soft play centre.  It is clear that the Father had regular contact with all three children and that this continued until the children left Australia in January this year. </p>

The Father describes staying over at the Mother&#8217;s house with the children to look after them when they she was away and at other times staying with the children in hotels.  The Mother states that this occurred only on a handful of occasions and that the children would not in fact stay overnight in hotels.  I am not in a position to make any detailed findings about this on the summary evidence that I have received.  However, it is clear from e-mails exhibited to the parties&#8217; statements, that the Father was asked to look after the children with some regularity (an e-mail of 30 October 2019 identified four evenings in November </p>

This is said to be for financial reasons.  The Mother has given up her job in Australia and found a new one in England, which she would have to leave if she returned to Australia.  Although she owns a house in Australia, this is not available as it is currently let out, rent free, to a builder who is renovating it in return for the right to live in it.  The Mother also contended that the effect on A of a return would be so devastating that her presence or absence would make no difference to the position.  She explained that in 2015 when he was 8 A had had a &#8220;breakdown&#8221; following the death of his maternal grandfather to whom he was close.  She referred to him as having had hundreds of hours of support from professionals, including a psychiatrist and psychologist, in Australia and explained that she had been taught strategies to deal with aspects of A&#8217;s behaviour. </p>

However, if that is not to be, he has proposed that all three children should live with him, his present partner and her son.  Cross-examining the Father, Ms Jones asked him some questions about how he would cope with the challenges that may be thrown up by A&#8217;s behaviour.  He accepted that as a teenager A has what he referred to as &#8220;moments&#8221;, but he referred to sitting down with A, showing patience and being there for him.  He recognised that given A&#8217;s current views a return could be challenging, but he did not feel that his relationship with his son was irreparable. </p>

She told Mr Gupta for the Father that she was concerned that the boys were being influenced by the Mother and that they should have been (and had not been) protected from adult dynamics and from information relating to these proceedings.  She also accepted Mr Gupta&#8217;s characterisation of B&#8217;s views regarding a return as a preference.  However, when cross-examined by Miss Jones she stated that she felt that both boys were objecting to a return to Australia, rather than just expressing a preference.  Ms Baker accepted Ms Jones&#8217;s contentions that A has additional needs arising from his condition; that he has difficulties dealing with sudden or unplanned change; that he has in the past had meltdowns over trivial matters and that he would need support on a return.  Ms Baker agreed that it was unknown how A would respond emotionally to a forced return but that it was likely that he would struggle.

There is no good answer to this question. So the poor draftsmanship of the Convention gives rise to a conundrum: although Art 13 expressly suggests that the consent of the left-behind parent is something which the removing parent may seek to establish by way of defence, is not its absence, rather, something which the left-behind parent must establish as part of his case under Art 3  that the removal was in breach of his rights of custody and thus, in effect, wrongful? But the conundrum is an old chestnut and I would not wish to say anything which might prompt resurrection of it, even if such were possible. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">In re P (A Child) (Abduction: Consent)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] Fam 293" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] Fam 293</ref> this court decided that the specificity of the reference to consent in Art 13 sufficed to draw all issues of consent into it and out of Art 3; as it happens, I also consider that the decision was correct.&#8221; </p>

This is apparent from the e-mail of 5 February 2019 in which the Mother sent the Father links to prospective schools in England.

It seems to me wholly improbable that if such an agreement was reached there was not a single text or e-mail exchanged with the Father over the next six months that made any reference to their agreed plan.  There is nothing providing the Father with the final details of the children&#8217;s schools or the arrangements for their long-term accommodation.  There are no details of any discussions about the arrangements for the Father to have contact with the children directly or indirectly. </p>

To the extent that I am required to consider these issues in the context of Art 3 of the Convention, I find that the Mother has wrongfully retained the children in the UK.

The Father swore his affidavit for the Australian Central Authority on 11 March, less than a fortnight after it had become clear to him that the children were not returning.

This is a &#8220;fairly low threshold requirement&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Re M </span> at [56]) and as the Court of Appeal recognised in that case there may be difficulty in separating out an objection to a return to a country or to a return to a set of circumstances in that country.

The judges who try these cases do so regularly and build up huge experience in dealing with them, as do the CAFCASS officers who interview the children involved. I do not think that they need (or will be assisted by) an analysis of how to go about this part of their task. In making his or her findings and evaluation, the judge will be able to draw upon the entirety of the material that has been assembled in relation to the child's objections exception and to pick from it those features which are relevant to his or her determination. The starting point is the wording of Article 13 which requires, as the authorities which I would choose to follow confirm, a determination of whether the child objects, whether he or she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his or her views, and what order should be made in all the circumstances.&#8221; </p>

That would have required evidence as to what protective steps would be possible in Lithuania, the submission went. </p>

That is what the judge did here. It was for the mother, who opposed the return, to substantiate the Article 13b exception (see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re E</span> supra para [32]) and for the court to evaluate the evidence within the confines of the summary process. Hogg J found the mother&#8217;s evidence about what had happened to be inconsistent with her actions in that she had continued her relationship with the father and allowed him to have the care of E, see for example what she said in para [37] about the mother not having done anything to corroborate her evidence. She also put the allegations in context, bearing in mind what Mr Power had said about something good having happened in E&#8217;s parenting, which she took as a demonstration that E would not be at risk if returned to Lithuania (para [36]). The Article 13b argument had therefore not got off the ground in the judge&#8217;s view. The judgment about the level of risk was a judgment which fell to be made by Hogg J and we should not overturn her judgment on it unless it was not open to her (see the important observations of the Supreme Court on this subject at para [35] of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re S</span>, supra). Nothing has been said in argument to demonstrate that the view Hogg J took was not open to her; in the light of it, it was unnecessary for her to look further at the question of protective measures. She would have taken the same view even if the child had been going back to the father&#8217;s care, but the Article 13b case was weakened further by the fact that the mother had ultimately agreed to return with E.<span style="font-style:italic">&#8221;</span></p>

His school report for his final year in Australia shows him doing well academically, attaining As and Bs in the majority of his subjects.  E-mail exchanges between the school and the Mother from 2019 showed that he was distracted by games on his laptop computer, and the Mother gave evidence of some other difficulties that he had experienced, including the incident of July 2019 when he sent the chain of text-messages that I have set out at para [29] above.

A appears to have coped well with the move from Australia to England, and there is no suggestion that he has required any professional support (beyond the general support available through his school) to cope with the changes that have arisen from this move and from the additional uncertainty that has been engendered by the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>

I accept the evidence that appropriate professional support (such as he has received in the past) would be available for A in Australia, through organisations and through individuals such as the therapist identified by the father.  Whilst I note what the Mother has said about the immediate availability of the organisation and individual therapist, I must assume that appropriate professional support will be available for A upon his return should he require it.

Whilst the current proceedings have clearly strained their relationship, it is noteworthy that as recently as April telephone contact between the Father and children was (in the Mother&#8217;s words) &#8220;amicable&#8221;.  I do not accept that it would be intolerable for the children to live with the Father whilst the Australian courts determined issues of their welfare.  Indeed one of the issues which appears to have led to A and B&#8217;s negative views of the Father appear to have arisen from the fact that the Father has not spent enough time with them and declined to come to England to be with them during the pandemic.

For the Father, Mr Gupta suggested that it might be possible for the requirement to be waived and for the Father and children to quarantine at his home.  I cannot reach any conclusion as to whether such waiver would be possible (although if it is, then it would be preferable).  However, I do not consider that a quarantine requirement such as this is capable of founding an Art 13b defence under the Convention. </p>

Were I to exercise my discretion and refuse to return A and B as a result of their objections, I consider that it would be intolerable to expect C to return to Australia with her Father whilst leaving her brothers and her Mother behind in England.  However, and to make the position clear, for the reasons that I have explained at para [122] above, I do not consider that it would be intolerable for C to return to Australia without her Mother, provided that her brothers accompany her so that the children remain together as a sibling group.

These policy considerations include, not only the swift return of abducted children, but also comity between the contracting states and respect for one another's judicial processes. Furthermore, the Convention is there, not only to secure the prompt return of abducted children, but also to deter abduction in the first place. The message should go out to potential abductors that there are no safe havens among the contracting states. </p>

As is clear from the earlier discussion, the Convention was the product of prolonged discussions in which some careful balances were struck and fine distinctions drawn. The underlying purpose is to protect the interests of children by securing the swift return of those who have been wrongfully removed or retained. The Convention itself has defined when a child must be returned and when she need not be. Thereafter the weight to be given to Convention considerations and to the interests of the child will vary enormously. The extent to which it will be appropriate to investigate those welfare considerations will also vary. But the further away one gets from the speedy return envisaged by the Convention, the less weighty those general Convention considerations must be.&#8221; </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;[46] In child's objections cases, the range of considerations may be even wider than those in the other exceptions. The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are &#8220;authentically her own&#8221; or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.&#8221; </p>

I will hear argument from counsel when I hand down this judgment on the precise terms of my order and the extent to which the undertakings offered by the Father should be incorporated into orders made under Art 11 of the 1996 Hague Convention.  I note that the proposed undertaking that the children should not be introduced to the Father&#8217;s new partner or her child cannot be offered if the children are to return to live with the Father as is currently proposed. </p>

As I have set out above, I do not consider that Art 13b is satisfied, even if the Mother refuses to return to Australia with the children.  Nonetheless it seems to me that the children would find the return significantly easier if their Mother were to accompany them.  As I have indicated, the protective measures sought in Mother&#8217;s first witness statement appear to have been proposed on the basis that the Mother would accompany the children, and I would ask her to reconsider her current opposition to doing so. </p>
