We did confront him and he said yes he removed it. We informed the nursing home, safeguarding, and the police. None of them took it seriously. We were told he was working for her best interest! We kept contacting the home as they still contact David to discuss her funding which we find disgusting due to the circumstances. We keep contacting Safeguarding. We were told that Finance Safeguarding would be taking it to the Court of Protection. I trusted them to do this but they lied and never did.  We have tried to protect her and keep him away from her but the nursing home will not listen to us. They find it somewhat amusing. We have brought her toiletries and clothing for 3 years. Her daughter died September 2012. Since then he has made it difficult - even more so now - to look after her. He&#8217;s told the home that we cannot buy nothing for her any more but no one else does. DC&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s wishes, before she died, were to look after her mum but it feels he is stopping us doing this.&#8221;</span></p>

Due to her advanced dementia she is currently unable to give her wishes and feelings. We do know however that her previous wishes and feelings involved having her daughter and son in law involved in her care and finances. It is the council&#8217;s view that David has always been important in DC&#8217;s life and that he supported his wife with her role when she was alive. It is noted that there are no allegations regarding Maureen and she would have been aware of David&#8217;s actions during most of the contested period. The council are concerned about the motives of Donna and Alan which seem to focus on having financial control of DC&#8217;s limited financial affairs rather than working in consultation with her wider family and the care home where she lives. We would respectfully request that the court consider Croydon Council as financial deputy and not appointing a welfare deputy.&#8221;</p>

It is emphatically not part of the scheme underpinning the Act that there should be one individual who as a matter of course is given a special legal status to make decisions about incapacitated persons. Experience has shown that working together is the best policy to ensure that incapacitated adults such as E receive the highest quality of care. This case is an example of what can go wrong when people do not work together.&#8221;</span></p>
