It concerns two children: J, aged six, and B, aged three.  The application, dated 27</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;November 2014, is to enforce a contact order that was made on 2</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;December 2013 by District Judge Bowman.  That order, amongst other things, contemplated contact taking place between the father and the children both in England and in Spain.</span></p>

In a nutshell, they are now living with their mother in Spain, having very little direct contact with their father, but regular contact by Skype, and there is a major issue between the parents about how the wider terms of the 2013 order should be put into effect.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The application has an unfortunate procedural history.  It started with a Deputy District Judge appropriately referring the matter of jurisdiction to this court within a short while of the application being issued; but hearing dates in March and April went by without the matter being resolved because of the lack of an available judge.  It has eventually come before me today, and I&#160;have had the benefit of very helpful submissions on behalf of the father from Mr.&#160;Andrew Lorie, and on behalf of the mother by Miss Lyndsey Sambrooks-Wright.  The father has been present.  The mother is, with the court&#8217;s permission, not present but has been in contact with her counsel as required.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I&#160;next describe the chronology.  The parents met in 2004 in Spain and began a relationship.  At some point thereafter, and at all events by 2007, they began to live together.  In 2008 J was born in Spain.  In March 2010 the parents were married in Gibraltar.  In May 2012 B was born, also in Spain.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">There is a discrepancy (that does not signify for the purpose of my decision) between the accounts of the parents as to when they were living in Spain and when they were living in England.  By the time we get to 2012 and the birth of B, it is apparent that they had spent substantial periods of time in both countries.  They had created a business in Spain.  In November 2012 on the father&#8217;s chronology, the family came to live in England and at some point in the following year the final separation took place.  The date is put at March 2013 by the father and November 2013 by the mother.  Again, the process may have been protracted and it does not make any difference to the overall picture, which is that by the end of 2013 the parents&#8217; futures lay in different directions, with the clear intention that the children should live with their mother but have a meaningful and regular relationship with their father.</span></p>

The matter came before District Judge Bowman on 2</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December 2013.  Neither parent was represented at that hearing, and the resultant order is not expressed in a satisfactory way.  I&#160;propose to set out the five paragraphs of the order as they were actually made, and then to set them out as they perhaps should have been expressed; as part of my order today, I&#160;will amend the terms of the order from the former to the latter so that in any future proceedings, particularly ones where a translation is required, the order reads as it should.</span></p>

He says that he went to Spain to see the children for long weekends in the summer and autumn of 2013, and that there was then a gap of about a year until October 2014.  The mother says that in fact he also visited in May and July 2014.  However, in October 2014 there was a serious argument between the parents in front of the children at the end of a period of contact &#8211; the topic of the argument being the mother&#8217;s wish to take the children on holiday at Christmas when the father expected to see them himself.</span></p>

Happily, he was able to go to Spain and to see the children for about a week over the New Year 2015.  Unhappily, he has not seen them face to face since then.  Even with the benefit of their current English lawyers, the parents&#8217; efforts to set up what should be quite simple arrangements for contact this Easter came to nothing.</span></p>

That would not seem to have been a basis for divorce that was consistent with the facts, and the mother did not agree.  The father, in September 2014, then issued a behaviour petition leading to the mother issuing a behaviour cross-petition the following month.  Those proceedings are apparently ongoing.</span></p>

The first question for this hearing is whether the court has jurisdiction to entertain the father&#8217;s application.  The mother says that it does not because she contends that the children are not habitually resident in this jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 8 of the Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003 known as &#8220;Brussels II Revised&#8221;.  The father contends that the children are habitually resident here, remaining so by virtue of the 2013 order and other features of the case.

It requires an evaluation of all relevant circumstances.  It focuses upon the situation of the child, with the purposes and intentions of the parents being merely among the relevant factors.  It is necessary to assess the degree of integration of the child into a social and family environment in the country in question.  The social and family environment of an infant or young child is shared with those (whether parents or others) on whom she is dependent; hence it is necessary in such a case to assess the integration of that person or persons in the social and family environment of the country concerned.  The essentially factual and individual nature of the inquiry should not be glossed with legal concepts which would produce a different result from that which the factual inquiry would produce &#8230;&#8221;.</span></p>

Whatever thoughts the mother might have harboured when she agreed to the order, there is no doubt that it records an intention that the children should go to Spain and come back.  The court stated that the children should remain habitually resident in England and Wales during that period.  It is common ground between the parties that that is to be weighed as a relevant factor, but that it cannot be an overriding one because, as has been repeatedly made clear, the court has to look at the actual factual situation and not substitute legal concepts or hypothetical ones for the reality.</span></p>

At present it is not at all clear how the mother could obtain the right to live in England; the father&#8217;s response is that the children can come and live with him in her basence does not reflect the purpose of the 2013 order any more than the mother&#8217;s present position does.</span></p>

The children are dependant on their mother and both she and they have have a significant history of living in Spain.  The factual enquiry I have conducted takes account of the intentions of the parents and the court that are reflected in the 2013 order, but I find that while these carry significant weight, they are outweighted by the circumstances of the children&#8217;s actual situation as habitual residents of Spain.     </span></p>

In the end, the parents will have to find a solution for the children.  They do not have to do this through lawyers or through courts except as a last resort, and I&#160;hope that there may now be some effort to reach a solution that will allow the children to benefit from each of them to the fullest possible extent.</span></p>
