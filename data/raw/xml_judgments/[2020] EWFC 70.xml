Paragraph 7 of my order provided that the applicant was by 4pm on 11 November 2020 (time to be of the essence) to notify both the court and the respondents&#8217; solicitors whether or not he intended to pursue the claim and that in the event that he failed within that time to comply with that direction then (unless the court had on application made by the applicant before the expiry of the relevant time extended time) (i) the applicant should be debarred from pursuing any such claim and (ii) the Restriction should be removed. </p>
