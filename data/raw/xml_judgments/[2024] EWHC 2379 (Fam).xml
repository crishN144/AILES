They lived together initially in Father&#8217;s flat, and then in a flat in Kyiv belonging to the maternal grandmother. They married in November 2019 in Ukraine. Their daughter, to whom I shall refer by the pseudonym Ludmila, was born in June 2020.</p>

On 9 March 2022, Father tried to leave Ukraine with Ludmila via the Polish border, but was detained at the checkpoint. Ludmila was returned to Mother, and the two of them and the maternal grandmother left Ukraine together the following day. Following a short time in Poland, Mother and Ludmila were accommodated in England from 19 April 2022, under the &#8216;Homes for Ukraine&#8217; scheme. Mother and Ludmila still live here. Father remains in Ukraine, and has had no contact with Ludmila since March 2022.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Legal proceedings relating to the residence of Ludmila, and contact with Ludmila, initially took place between the parents in Ukraine. In May 2021 Father issued proceedings in Zaporizhzhia, which seem to have gone nowhere. After Father took Ludmila in September 2021, Mother issued proceedings in Kyiv, seeking an order that Ludmila live with her. After Ludmila was back in Mother&#8217;s care and living in England, those proceedings were resolved, at first instance, by the Ukrainian court in April 2023. The Ukrainian court determined that it was in Ludmila&#8217;s best interests for her to continue to live with Mother. Father&#8217;s appeal against that decision was refused. Father has filed a cassation appeal, which has not yet been resolved.</p>

It is common experience that abusive relationships may last for a long time and that victims of abuse may struggle to remove themselves from such a situation. It is the experience of the courts that people who are in an abusive relationship may struggle to extricate themselves from it for a whole range of reasons including fear, shame, lack of resources, family responsibilities, cultural or societal concerns and/or their own conflicting emotions towards their abuser. Further, their capacity to react to events may be compromised or blunted by their past experience or their mental or physical health. Where the abuse is not physical but psychological, emotional and/or financial, those subject to it may not even recognise themselves as victims of abuse, particularly where the behaviours develop over time.&#8221;</p>

I consider she has reached the point where she has no trust in Father whatsoever, where every action of his is seen in the worst possible light. As she frankly said in evidence, she believes Father has nothing positive to offer Ludmila. She described the relationship with Father now as a &#8216;war&#8217; &#8211; which he had started in September 2021. She struck me as being very focused on achieving her objective of (in her view) protecting Ludmila by preventing any contact between Father and her daughter. In pursuit of that objective, Mother was prepared to, and did, give false evidence.</p>

By this time, Ludmila was back in her mother&#8217;s care, and I consider Mother was very focused on ensuring they were never separated again, at any cost. Mother told that psychologist that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the couple has not lived together since November 2020, which was based on the manifestations of cruelty, emotional and physical violence of [Father] towards [Mother] which occurred in the presence of the child</span>&#8221;. I note that Mother did not suggest to the psychologist that Father was physically abusive of Ludmila, although that featured in her testimony before me. Nor (albeit, in the summary given by the psychologist) was there any mention of financial abuse, surveillance of Mother, tracking Mother, and threats to take Ludmila to Crimea &#8211; all of which formed part of her testimony to me.</p>

I was left with the strong impression that Mother was willing to say whatever would assist her to achieve her objective of keeping Father away from Ludmila. In my judgment, Mother&#8217;s evidence to the Ukrainian court (summarised at paragraph 28 above) is a fair reflection of what really happened: Father was overly-critical, while Mother felt unsupported &#8211; especially in the context of struggling with lactation, and the stresses of the Covid-19 pandemic which would have been felt throughout society in Ukraine as around the world. Into the mix were the arguments and occasional anger that may be found in any relationship. In my judgment, there was not at this time cruelty, nor emotional or physical violence. While I accept that Mother did feel belittled and criticised by Father, and did not make up that element of her complaint, I find that Mother&#8217;s allegations of physical violence towards both herself and Ludmila were invented with the objective of keeping Father away from Ludmila.</p>

Mother&#8217;s recollection is that Ludmila was asleep, but Mother was upset that Father did not show any interest in seeing Ludmila or staying to help Mother. Father&#8217;s recollection is that he did see Ludmila, but did not want to disturb her. More significantly, perhaps, is that in her evidence to me Mother accused Father of being &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">abusive</span>&#8221; this day &#8211; because he opened the front door with his own key. Mother&#8217;s evidence was that she knew Father was coming over, but did not know that he would use his key to enter; Father&#8217;s evidence was that he did use his key, but the door was locked from the inside, so Mother opened the door. On either case, I do not accept there was anything abusive here, but I do consider that Mother&#8217;s readiness now to characterise it as such is indicative of her efforts to cast the relationship with Father as &#8216;abusive&#8217; in an attempt to achieve her objectives. </p>

The car rental manager followed the car remotely, using an on-board GPS tracker, which showed that it went to Zaporizhzhia, arriving there at about 1.40pm, in the Komunarskyi district. The witness said that the following day he was called by Father and told the car had been left in the Komunarskyi district, and he was subsequently sent the keys to collect the car.</p>

Approximately at 19.00 I&#8217;ve heard the screaming of my daughter, I looked out of the window at the kitchen, it was open, and I saw a red car parked between the second and third blocks, from the one side of the car there was a man punching [the maternal grandmother] and slapping her down to the ground. From the other side of the car there was another man standing near the open back door. The baby carriage was near the car but there was no baby inside. The driver tossed aside [the maternal grandmother], set in the car and the car started driving out of the yard. I was screaming from the window. [The maternal grandmother] went upstairs to our apartment and asked for the phone to call to the police. She was yelling that unknown people kidnapped her granddaughter and her son-in-law [&#8230;] was punching her not giving her a chance to protect the granddaughter.

Man number 1 then grabbed the baby, while man number 2 fought the maternal grandmother. Both men got into a red car, with man number 2 driving. The maternal grandmother tried to stop him driving off, but he pushed her away so she fell, and drove the car off at high speed with the driver&#8217;s door swinging open.

He said that he and his mother planned to go to Kryvyi Rih for a few days, and each would need a car, so he rented a car with the plan that his mother would drive his Range Rover while he drove the rental car. They drove first to Zaporizhzhia intending to see Ludmila, but with no intention of doing more than spending some time with her and then leaving again. He had come to Zaporizhzhia previously with the same intention, in July 2021, but Mother refused to allow him any contact with his daughter and refused to open the door to him. On this occasion, they parked up the Range Rover, then both he and his mother got into the red Ford, and waited in the area for more than 5 hours (from 1.40pm until 7pm). He did not think there had been anyone other than the two of them in the car at any point.</p>

In cross-examination, Father said this had been the position since 2014.

I find that this was a pre-meditated and planned abduction; that Father deliberately hired a car so that he could get close to Ludmila without being recognised; that, in addition to his own mother, Father had another male accomplice, who was masked; that Father acted first in attacking the maternal grandmother; and that Father had with him a gun which he showed to the maternal grandmother in the course of the attack.</p>

His answer was that his action was not good in general, but that as he drove away, he called her &#8216;chipmunk&#8217;, and she laughed, so he did not think that Ludmila had been harmed. The impact on Ludmila of being removed from everything that was familiar to her &#8211; her carers, her clothes, her toys and bedding &#8211; seems not to have registered with him. What is more, Father thought that the real harm Ludmila had suffered had been in the previous 6 months, because he believed that Mother could not provide any emotional connection with Ludmila &#8211; as he put it: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">harm is measured in the absence of [Mother&#8217;s] warmth, walking with her, spending time, playing with her</span>&#8221;. Despite his formal admission, Father lacked insight into the harm that was undoubtedly caused to Ludmila by the violent manner in which she was snatched from her maternal grandmother, and by not seeing her mother (with whom she had always been) for the next six months.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Counsel for Mother described Father&#8217;s conduct in forcibly abducting Ludmila as an act of intense cruelty. I agree with that. I have also found that that Father lied about the circumstances of the abduction. I have of course borne these findings in mind when considering other allegations in the case. However, I have also borne in mind that Father had a particular motivation to lie about the circumstances of the 16 September 2021 abduction &#8211; namely, to avoid admitting breaching criminal law by the involvement of an accomplice, the use of a gun, or an unprovoked attack on the maternal grandmother &#8211; and so his lies about that do not necessarily mean he has lied about other matters. Further, the factual context changed quite dramatically over time. Without in any way condoning Father&#8217;s actions, they followed nine months of being completely and deliberately excluded from his child&#8217;s life. The cruel way in which Father behaved at that time provides only limited indications as to how he might have behaved at an earlier stage, before he and Mother separated, or at a later stage when he had the upper hand by having Ludmila within his care to the exclusion of Mother.</p>

There is no evidence that Mother was responsible for this action, and I cannot see that this incident has any relevance to future welfare decisions for Ludmila.

In my judgment, Father was determined not to allow any contact at this time, in part as a bargaining chip to secure agreement to Ludmila living permanently with him, in part out of fear that Mother would take Ludmila away, and in part out of revenge for Mother denying him time with Ludmila between January and September 2021.</p>

However, I do not find that there is any credible evidence to support Mother&#8217;s allegations or suspicions that while Ludmila was in her Father&#8217;s care in that period he mistreated his daughter. Mother invited me to view a video she took in March 2022, asking Ludmila &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Were you beaten?</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Is that how they beat you?

Nor am I assisted by Mother&#8217;s evidence concerning what she says Ludmila&#8217;s physical condition was in March 2022.

So that these blows wouldn&#8217;t hurt the child I&#8217;d cover her with my body and put my hands. As a result of his aggression, I suffered a blow to the wall and the caused me to bleed. My hand was smashed and my blood got on Ludmila&#8217;s clothes and my clothes. I enclose a photo at &#8230; which shows the stain of blood on my jacket at the time. Ludmila&#8217;s clothes were also blood stained. I was very scared. I tried to protect Ludmila from [Father]&#8217;s violence. Both myself and Ludmila were screaming. Several police officers came to our screams. I sat on the floor in a corner and covered Ludmila with myself until the policemen pulled [Father] away from us.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Father denied that any of this occurred. In his witness statement he said that, on the contrary, it was Mother who was violent, snatching Ludmila from him, hitting Ludmila&#8217;s head against the wall. He said Ludmila was crying, reaching out to him, but when he touched her hand Mother squeezed his left hand hard &#8211; a matter of which he later made a criminal complaint. Father says he was asked to wait outside while the police dealt with Mother, and that Ludmila would be returned to his care. However, the officers&#8217; attitude changed, and his and his relatives&#8217; documents were confiscated, and he was not allowed to approach his daughter again. In cross-examination, Father accepted that he was angry, but denied that he assaulted or threatened Mother or Ludmila, and, indeed, did not recall that the police officers ever left them alone together.</p>

I do not accept Mother&#8217;s evidence that Father made any threat to kill either her or Ludmila, nor her evidence that Father was violent towards either of them. I believed Father&#8217;s denial. I note the complete absence of any supporting evidence for Mother&#8217;s case &#8211; which is not consistent with Mother&#8217;s evidence that she told police officers of the threats and violence at the time. Mother alleges that the absence of evidence is a result of a conspiracy between Father and Ukrainian officials, but I have seen nothing to support that theory. I consider that the complaint made in Poland was tactical on Mother&#8217;s part, an attempt &#8211; now she had finally been reunited with Ludmila &#8211; to build a case to support her efforts to ensure that Ludmila would never be taken from her again.</p>

They did so without permission of the Ukrainian court, or Father, which appears to have been a wrongful removal under Ukrainian law. I accept Mother&#8217;s evidence that she did this both to protect Ludmila from the war (a desire which Father too had had), and out of a fear that if they remained in Ukraine Father might once again arrange the abduction of Ludmila.</p>

The backdrop to the decision was that, by this time, Ludmila had been living with Mother alone for more than a year. The court decided:</p>

The child has an established and stable way of life there. Changing this, in the court&#8217;s conviction, would negatively impact the child.
