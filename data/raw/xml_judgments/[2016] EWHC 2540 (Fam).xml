As this is an application to commit to prison for contempt, it was necessary that I&#160;should hear it entirely in public, as I&#160;do.

There have been care proceedings in relation to those children which culminated in care and then placement for adoption orders being made in relation to each child about a year ago.  Attempts were made to appeal those decisions which were finally rejected by a judge in the Court of Appeal in early February&#160;2016.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Shortly after that, a document was circulated, apparently by Mr&#160;and Mrs.&#160;Markwick, headed &#8220;Public Notice Order&#8221;.  That document gave the full names and dates of birth of the two children concerned and was critical of the acts and decisions of numerous people including judges and social workers in the history of the application for, and the making of, the care and placement orders.  Of course, anybody in a free society is fully entitled publicly to complain about the manner in which local authorities and/or the legal system operate, but the concern of the local authority was that, by actually naming and identifying the children concerned, and indeed by referring to them as their own grandchildren, the activities of Mr&#160;and Mrs&#160;Markwick might tend to undermine the placement of the children with their prospective adopters.  As a result, the Central&#160;Bedfordshire&#160;Council made an application to the High Court for a Reporting Restriction Order which was made by Keehan&#160;J on 29</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;February&#160;2016.

Photo shots of the websites are exhibited to the witness statement of the social worker, Beverley&#160;Sorensen.  On the face of it, these photo shots depict Facebook websites of Simon&#160;Markwick and Tracey&#160;Markwick respectively, whose names clearly appear on their respective Facebook sites.  So far as I&#160;am aware, nowhere in the material exhibited by Beverley Sorensen is there any reference at all to the name or address of either child, but there are a number of photographs, which I&#160;infer to be photographs of the children, and there is text which refers to, &#8220;My two wonderful [grandchildren] stolen from loving grandparents by Central Bedfordshire Social Services for forced adoption&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

As Beverley Sorensen stated at the end of her affidavit, &#8220;Whilst the placements are going well there is always a risk that such pressure and exposure increases the risk of disruption&#8221;.  As a result, the Central&#160;Bedfordshire&#160;Council issued the present application for committal.  That has very recently been served on each of Mr&#160;Markwick and Mrs&#160;Markwick and they are personally present today.</span></p>

They say that this was done by others and not by themselves and, accordingly, that they have a complete defence to the present application for committal.  They say, further, that they have, in any event, ensured that all the material in question has already been removed from their respective Facebook sites, and that they will do their very best to ensure that no such material is placed upon their sites or in any way published directly or indirectly by them in the future.</span></p>

In those circumstances the Central&#160;Bedfordshire&#160;Council have stated that, in any event, they no longer wish to pursue the present application to commit Mr&#160;or Mrs&#160;Markwick to prison for contempt of court.</span></p>

However, in view of the stated position of the Central&#160;Bedfordshire&#160;Council, it is obviously right and appropriate that this present application is brought to a complete end today.  I&#160;will, accordingly, finally dismiss the application that was issued on 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;August&#160;2016 to commit Simon&#160;Andrew&#160;Markwick and Tracey&#160;Anne&#160;Markwick to prison for contempt of court.</span></p>
