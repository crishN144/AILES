In fact, a Non-Molestation Order had previously been in place against H, but had not been renewed upon its expiry after having been in force for one year. These factors formed the backdrop to the court&#8217;s decision to appoint a QLR.</p>

As I have already stated, Ms Gallagher is based in a chambers in Manchester. All attempts to secure a QLR in the South-East failed. It speaks highly of Ms Gallagher&#8217;s professionalism that she was prepared to accept this appointment when the current fee structure does not provide for travel or overnight accommodation expenses. </p>

Each conducted their role in a considered, calm and incisive manner. Mr Barnett-Thoung-Holland could not have done anything more for his client. The criticisms I have about H&#8217;s case are directed at him alone and do not represent in any way the skilful way in which Mr Barnett-Thoung-Holland sought to advance the case he was required to put. I am also grateful to him for the schedule of key issues and cross references which he provided for me in closing. It has been of great assistance in marshalling this judgment.</p>

W is very strongly of the opinion that the nursery has been important stability for A during the parties&#8217; separation. The fees when A joined the nursey were &#163;1,262.04 per month. That figure has now increased slightly. I am told it would cost a further &#163;12,380.94 for A to complete her nursey education over the next nine months. There are outstanding fees at the date of the hearing of &#163;2,912.55, bringing the total due to &#163;15,293.49. There is however a deposit of &#163;1,262 on account, bringing the amount actually payable to &#163;14,031. W says this is very important for A and H says that it is unaffordable.</p>

Obviously the primary carer needs whatever is available to make the main home for the children, but it is of importance, albeit of lesser importance that the other parent should have a home of his own where the children can enjoy contact time with him. Of course there are cases where there is not enough to provide a home for either. Of course there are cases where there is only enough to provide for one. But in any case where there is, by stretch and a degree of risk-taking, the possibility of a division to enable both to rehouse themselves, that is an exceptionally important consideration and one which will almost invariably have a decisive impact on outcome.&#8221;</p>

In this context, the term QLR simply refers to a legal representative of the relevant party&#8217;s choosing with rights of audience. In theory, it seems to me, the party may instruct a legal representative to deal only with the cross-examination which has been prohibited. In practice, the extent of the role which the legal representative is instructed to undertake will be a matter for discussion between the party and the lawyer in accordance with the standard provisions of the BSB Handbook or SRA Code of Conduct. This sits in contrast to the role of a court appointed QLR who is not instructed by or responsible to the prohibited party, and whose role is necessarily very limited.  The role of any legal representative instructed by a party will necessarily be broader than that of a court appointed QLR by virtue of such instruction, as it must include taking instructions and client confidentiality. An instructed legal representative will also be expected to cross-examine on the party&#8217;s full case, speak with the other side on behalf of their client as required, and draft orders, unless specifically and unusually instructed by their client not to do so.    </p>

This was entirely proper and something which all members of the Bar are obliged to consider. However absent an appointment as the QLR, for data protection reasons, it was not possible for the bundle to be shared with her in advance of her appointment.

W was later ordered by DDJ Gill on the 12 July 2023 to explain the background to the ownership agreement and why the original of this is not available and what steps she had taken to find it. The background to this is that H was asserting that the document is a recent fabrication created as a sham for the purposes of these proceedings. H does not accept that it was signed on the 15 October 2015. He further notes the peculiarity that it is expressly signed in advance of the purchase date of the 6 November 2015.</p>

There was also a reference to a contribution to a kitchen appliance from the W&#8217;s parents. The document was shared during the marriage and created by H as he is good with spreadsheets. </p>

Whilst I accept that this is an odd approach to matters, it can be argued that W&#8217;s purchase of the family home is nothing to do with the second property, but they were both adamant that this had happened and I believe them. This would date the agreement significantly prior to the breakdown of the marriage.</p>

The payments make good the detriment required to found a common intention constructive trust. However, this is very much an alternative to my primary finding that the document was genuine and determinative as to beneficial ownership.</p>

He produced no document or expert evidence which made good on this point. When the point was put to W&#8217;s brother, he readily accepted that metadata on electronic documents can change as they are processed on different computers. H also said, without any expert evidence to support such a proposition, that the metadata had been removed in such a way that only someone who is expert in computers would be able to do this. Having carefully prepared the ground in this way, supported by no expert evidence whatsoever, he then took the opportunity to remind the court that the brother has a PhD in computer science and works in computers. I consider this to be a determined and dishonest attempt to persuade the court that the agreement is not genuine. I am not falling for this one bit. H&#8217;s behaviour in this regard reflects very poorly on him and causes me to doubt his credibility generally.</p>

He gave a guarded, calculated and unhelpful written answer when asked to explain himself. An unclear and unsatisfactory explanation was only forthcoming once W had been put to the trouble of proving his legal title and sale herself. I find that H has deliberately failed to give me a full and frank explanation. He has provided lots of smoke and mirrors, but what he had failed to do is to provide a bank statement showing how much the property was sold for and where the money went. Given his mother&#8217;s apparent willingness to assist, this, I am afraid must sit in his lap. There was no suggestion by H she would not have produced the bank statement.</p>

	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.39in">The burden of proof is on H in this regard. He was the holder of the legal title from 2007 until 2022 and so it fell to him to give a full and proper explanation of what has happened here. It is agreed, and in any event I so find, that the presumption here is that the beneficial ownership will follow the legal title. The court therefore presumes that he is the beneficial owner of the sale proceeds unless he is able to discharge the evidential burden on him. He has failed to do so in circumstances where he has been unhelpful and chosen not to provide the court with the documentation which was in his power to do so. This is in a context where I have found him to be attempting to wilfully mislead the court in respect of the second property. I have found him to be an unsatisfactory witness. </p>

There is a suggestion by H that his mother may have purchased a property in Turkey with the money but given that it seems I cannot place reliance on him as a truthful witness, I do not accept this evidence, absent cogent documentary support. I do not consider his mother holding a power of attorney to be evidence that she was also the beneficial owner. </p>

W told me that she did not control the purse strings in the marriage and that she would not have been able to make a decision to pursue such litigation without H&#8217;s permission. W also told me that once the litigation had been unsuccessful H refused to assist further with the outstanding debt, despite having been very &#8220;on board&#8221; with legal bills during the life of employment law litigation prior to its ultimate failure. To the extent that it makes any difference to the decision I am going to make, this is a matrimonial debt. The firm of solicitors has issued proceedings for the recovery of the debt.</p>

Having made the findings that I have about the Iranian property proceeds, W can have 100% of the equity. This is not a 50/50 case. W is the primary care giver and the assets are extremely modest. Even without the Iranian property finding W would be entitled to a significant departure from equality on the basis of needs and her ongoing contributions to the welfare of A. I have in mind Moor J&#8217;s comments in <span style="font-style:italic">Butler</span> that I am not obliged to meet the needs of both parties if it is not possible to do so.</p>

	      <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.03in">I am going to invite submissions on costs. Under s.28.3(7)(f) I am required to look at the financial effect on the parties of any costs order. No doubt H will submit that he does not have any money with which to settle any costs order I may consider making. The Vanguard Group pension of &#163;25,326 is, in one sense, just money (albeit its receipt will be deferred). It would be ordinary for a costs order to be settled within 14 days. However, the justice of the case may mean that it cannot be settled within 14 days, but it would still be appropriate for a costs order to be settled in some way rather than not at all. I consider that a pension sharing order may, unusually on the particular facts of this case, be a vehicle through which any costs order which I may make can be settled. W&#8217;s costs in the financial remedy proceedings were about &#163;40,000. A pension share equal to about &#163;25,000 might be comparable to the kind of figure a court would order taking into account that even if H had chosen to conduct himself honourably within these proceedings, W would still have had some costs getting to an FDR. I shall await any further written submissions about costs, but it will come as no surprise that I am considering some costs consequences for the manner in which H has conducted this litigation.</p>

It tells me something about how unpleasant this man has the potential to be. He will no doubt be annoyed with my decision and I can see the potential for what he might do to the FMH and its contents which I will be requiring him to leave behind. I am not going to order a dismissal of W&#8217;s lump sum or pension claims until H has complied with the terms of my order. If I am later told he has destroyed, hidden or refused to return chattels which I have ordered to be given to W, of the many enforcement mechanisms I intend to keep at my disposal is the ability to make a lump sum order or deprive him of further pension assets. The pensions are the only assets within the jurisdiction I can easily make an order in respect of. I have in mind the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Amin v Amin </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2017/1114" uk:canonical="[2017] EWCA Civ 1114" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWCA Civ 1114</ref> where Moylan J&#8217;s (as he then was) decision to leave open pension claims as an aid to possible enforcement was upheld by the Court of Appeal. Once there has been compliance with the terms of this order with an orderly handover of the FMH and the contents in good condition, the pension claim (but subject also to my costs&#8217; determination) and lump sum claims can be dismissed. This approach is without prejudice to the other enforcement mechanisms which may be brought to bear against him.</p>

I know more than enough about the parties and their finances, and applying the overriding objective, to be able to make this modest addendum to my decision without the need for a further hearing (see also paragraph [169] above). It would be an affront to fairness to do otherwise.</p>

	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.39in">Finally, W notes that there is a restriction on the FMH mortgage account which she wishes to have lifted forthwith. W required the restriction in the first place so that each party would have to agree to any further steps in relation to the mortgage. I agree that this restriction must now be lifted as H will have no legal or beneficial entitlement to the property. His protections in respect of the mortgage are to be found in the court order.  Can I please ask Mr Barnett-Thoung-Holland to reflect that in the draft order.</p>
