	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is my final judgment in relation to an application brought by a former wife pursuant to Part III of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>&#8221;).  Over the course of 4 days between 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2016, I dealt with what has been referred to as &#8220;the Stage II&#8221; hearing of the application.  My earlier judgment in relation to &#8220;the Stage I&#8221; hearing in March 2016 is reported as <span style="font-style:italic">Z v Z &amp; Others </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/911" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 911 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 911 (Fam)</ref>.  In that judgment, I determined that it was appropriate for the English court to make an order, or orders, for financial provision for the applicant under Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>.  Because of an inadequate time estimate, there was insufficient time in the context of that hearing to deal with quantum and/or the nature of the financial relief to which she should be entitled.  In order to utilise the court time which had been set aside for the March hearing, I agreed to deal with matters on the basis of a split hearing.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I made plain in my earlier judgment, there has been a considerable overlap in the matters which I have had to consider in respect of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 16</ref>, 17 and 18 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>.  To an extent, there has been further ventilation of the same, or very similar, evidence and legal submissions during the course of this Stage II hearing.  Since my earlier judgment was full in terms of the background and the events which triggered the current application, it is essential reading for a full understanding of my decision in relation to the final disposal of the applicant&#8217;s claims.  I adopt it and incorporate that judgment in full as an integral part of this judgment and will not repeat any of that information here, even by way of introduction.  These proceedings are part-heard and both judgments (when read together) reflect my findings and my decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before moving on, I would say only this.  In terms of effective case management, proper consideration should be given to realistic time estimates at an early stage of these Part III claims.  The factual background to this particular case was, and is, complex.  The details in relation to the underlying offshore trust structures and the manner in which those structures have changed in terms of the beneficial interests of various family members was always going to be the subject of careful scrutiny and analysis.  Because of the interrelationship between various sections of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>, it will always be in the interests of the parties and the judge trying this type of case to deal with both limbs of an application in a single hearing.  Much of the evidence will be common to both limbs:  the question of whether it is appropriate to make an order and, if so, the quantum and structure of the order(s) to be made.  This case has now occupied nine days of court time and several more in terms of judgment-writing.  Much of the same ground has been covered and re-covered.  Whilst the case has been immaculately presented by the legal teams, split hearings in cases such as this should, in my judgment, be avoided.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst Mr Lewis Marks QC and Miss Katie Cowton (instructed by Lady Ward) continue to represent the respondent, the applicant has been represented in this Stage II hearing by Mr Richard Todd QC and Mr Nicholas Yates (instructed by Vardags). I have already expressed my gratitude to both legal teams for the care and industry which have so obviously gone into both their written and oral presentations.  As in the Stage I hearing, both parties gave their oral evidence (which, in the applicant&#8217;s case, was extensive) with assistance from professional interpreters.  Whilst each can converse relatively fluently in English, neither felt confident in dealing with the more technical (or legal) aspects of the case without that assistance.  Similarly, as in Stage I, there was no representation on behalf of, or appearance by, the second and third respondents, Codan Trust Company Limited (&#8220;Codan&#8221;) and Kopt Development Limited (&#8220;Kopt&#8221;).  The former is the corporate offshore trustee of the (Bermudan) BMT Trust, the ultimate owner, through Kopt, of the Kensington house which is central to the dispute between the parties in this Stage II hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 26 May 2016, Lady Justice King refused the respondent&#8217;s application for permission to appeal my decision in relation to the Stage I hearing.  She held that such an appeal held no reasonable prospects of success on the basis that the interplay between <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 16</ref>, 17 and 18 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref> would enable the respondent to raise each of the arguments advanced in support of his appeal at the Stage II hearing which she directed should take place in accordance with the agreed listing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other significant development in the case is an open offer from the trustees of the BMT Trust to &#8220;buy out&#8221; the applicant&#8217;s annuity entitlement under the trust terms for a single accelerated payment of &#163;1 million.  Since Codan holds limited assets apart from the Kensington house, it appears that the trustee intends to fund this payment (in part, at least) from the advance rental payment of just over &#163;1 million.  That is the sum which the respondent has already paid in part-implementation of his offer to make the property available as a home for the applicant and the children for the next six years until their youngest child reaches his 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> birthday by which stage it is anticipated that the tertiary education of all three children of this family will have been completed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In accordance with directions which I made at the conclusion of the Stage I hearing, both parties have made open proposals in relation to the outcome of these proceedings.  I was presented with an updated schedule of assets which is, by and large, agreed subject to some enquiry during the course of cross-examination as to various changes in the respective financial positions of the parties.  In part, these changes are a reflection of the global costs bill of just under &#163;2.2 million which has been spent on this litigation.  In broad terms, each has spent over a million pounds fighting this case to its conclusion.  This expenditure will inevitably have had a greater impact on the applicant&#8217;s financial position since she has far fewer assets available to her.  Whilst we worked throughout the hearing on the basis that her remaining capital was in the order of &#163;3.8 million<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"> That &#163;3.8 million is made up of two London flats which she rents out as investment vehicles (together worth c.&#163;1.28 million) and a portfolio of cash/investments which is managed by EFG.</p>
	      </authorialNote>, it appears that a final payment to her solicitors at the end of last week had reduced her asset base to just over &#163;3.68 million.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The respondent&#8217;s financial position (&#8216;on paper&#8217; at least) has deteriorated between the two hearings by just over &#163;7 million.  At the Stage I hearing in March this year, his personal asset base (including his trust interests) was said to be c. &#163;40 million.  It is now put at just under &#163;33 million of which all but &#163;6.2 million (previously &#163;4.74 million) is held within various trust structures.  (This figure takes no account of the present value of a helicopter which he bought some time ago and which he valued in his Form E at just over &#163;540,000.)  In relation to two of those trusts (the BMT Trust which,  through Kopt, owns the Kensington house and the BMT Generations Trust which owns the yacht), the underlying trust instruments provide that he cannot benefit during the lifetime of his (now) 83 year old father, Dr Z.  Thus, whilst his liquid position has improved, the value of his trust interests has decreased by some &#163;8.5 million.   Mr Marks and Miss Cowton point to an error in the earlier calculation of the sterling value of the respondent&#8217;s interest in the Mezano Trust (his personal trust vehicle) at the time of his financial presentation at the Stage I hearing.  The Mezano Trust owns the property in Cyprus in which the respondent lives with his new family<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"> The property in Limassol was purchased in 2014 for &#8364;2,024,000.  It appears in the Trust accounts<span/>with a value of US$2,469,280 as at 31 December 2014.</p>
	      </authorialNote>.  It is said on his behalf that the value of &#163;13 million attributed to this trust was not correct because of an inaccurate currency conversion calculation.  In addition, funds were withdrawn from this source to pay for the acquisition of his purchase of a second property in Wycombe Square<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"> The Wycombe Square apartment was purchased in the respondent&#8217;s sole name for &#163;3.65 million with a mortgage of &#163;2.31 million.  The deposit and purchase costs were funded by a distribution from the Mezano Trust.  It is his case that this property, adjacent to the apartment which is already owned by the BMT Trust, came onto the market at a time when Dr Z, his father, was exploring the possibility of a move to London.  Since his father&#8217;s intentions have yet to crystallise with regard to a potential move from Moscow, the respondent accepts that it may not be economical to retain the property.</p>
	      </authorialNote>.  Similar conversion errors are said to have resulted in an overstatement in his updating disclosure of the underlying values of the assets held within the BMT Trust, the BMT Generations Trust and the BMT Legacy Trust.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is also right to highlight the fact that, of the total trust assets under the respondent&#8217;s control (now said to be &#163;26.6 million), some &#163;7.356 million is held within four separate trusts designated for the benefit of each of his current wife, his stepson and their two children. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For present purposes, it is enough to note that all of this wealth flows from the efforts and industry of his father, Dr Z, and the sale in 2000 of his shares in one of Russia&#8217;s largest mobile telephone providers which produced some US$600 million of which his shares were US$180 million.  The majority of that wealth has been channelled into charitable philanthropic trusts.  Dr Z retained only a very small proportion of that wealth for himself and his family.  The respondent&#8217;s evidence is that, outside the main family trusts of which he is now the Protector and life tenant, his father&#8217;s personal wealth is in the order of c. US$4 million.   Since Dr Z&#8217;s generosity to his sons (and the respondent is now his sole surviving son) and extended family was a feature of married life for these parties and the source of funding for their lifestyle as a family, there is now no marital acquest which might have been susceptible to a sharing claim.  Such property as the parties owned in Russia at the time of the Russian financial settlement in August 2009 has been divided in accordance with the terms of the Russian order.  The applicant sold her apartment in Moscow in May 2014 and applied the sale proceeds towards the purchase of her two London investment properties.  The circumstances of that sale and its timing are matters to which I shall return in due course. </p>

Aside from the rent which the respondent has paid in advance for the proposed rental term, he has not made any payments in respect of spousal support since the Russian order was finalised in 2009.  The applicant has been meeting her own living expenses from the rental income she receives and by dipping into her capital reserves.

Nevertheless it remains important to address its effect upon the respondent.  In some cases &#8230; a respondent can show that he has assumed financial obligations or otherwise arranged his financial affairs in the belief that the applicant would make no claim against him and that he has done so in a way which, even if it were possible, it would not be reasonable for him to put into reverse.&#8221;</p>

I am unable to accept the submission made by Mr Todd and Mr Yates on behalf of the applicant that the delay in this case can somehow be air-brushed completely from the case on the basis of the explanations provided by their client.  Those explanations and the details which she sought to graft onto her case in relation to undue pressure or duress came at a very late stage in the day (see paragraph 12 of my Stage I judgment).  There was no complaint about pressure or duress in relation to the Russian agreement when Mr Harper resumed conduct of the case on her behalf in November 2013.  The correspondence passing between solicitors at the time contains no reference to possible non-disclosure on the part of the respondent, nor does it advertise in any material respect the case which she now seeks to run in relation to her health or her psychological inability to proceed expeditiously with any extant financial claims she wished to pursue in this jurisdiction.  Whilst I accept that this aspect of her case was touched upon at various points in her earlier statements, the full exposition in all its detail only came in the weeks leading up to the Stage I hearing after many months of ongoing litigation and case management.  In these circumstances, I keep well in mind &#8211; as I did during the Stage I hearing -  the need to assess the weight which can properly be attached to the applicant&#8217;s case in relation to the reasons for the delay and the psychological pressures which she contends were operative during this period and preventing her from issuing her application.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I dealt with the aspect of delay in paragraphs 148 to 156 of my Stage I judgment in the context of its presence as a factor which has to be considered for the purposes of determining whether it would be appropriate for the court to make an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>.  In the course of that analysis, I made reference to the detailed chronology she had provided in her witness statement in relation to the interventions at various points from health professionals.  These professionals included a psychiatrist (Dr Beniashvili, whom the respondent himself recommended), a psychotherapist and a counsellor (whom she continues to see on a weekly basis).  There was some implied criticism from Mr Marks during the course of his submissions that I had somehow relied on these medical interventions in my earlier judgment whilst having refused permission at the start of the last hearing to admit in evidence the content of the reports and/or letters which these individuals had (very late in the day, and in the absence of a Part 25 application) produced.  As I had intended to make clear in paragraph 151 of my previous judgment, I did no more than collect from the chronology of the applicant&#8217;s involvement with these professionals over an extended period of time the extent to which she subjectively perceived the need for such support.  That chronology was not challenged in relation to its factual content.  I reminded myself about the various inconsistencies which I found there to be in her evidence although I found these did not contaminate the whole of her case so as to make her a generally unreliable witness.  Nevertheless, I went on to express concern that the evidence which appeared for the first time in her most recent &#8216;Stage I&#8217; statement appeared to be an attempt to bolster her defence to the perceived deficiencies of the case she was previously advancing, particularly in relation to the aspect of delay (paragraph 124).  On balance I did not find either party to be a dishonest or untruthful witness although I was satisfied that each had to one extent or another manipulated the &#8220;spin&#8221; which they sought to put on their evidence in order to assist the presentation of their respective cases in this litigation (paragraph 131).  Having listened carefully to them again over the course of the Stage II hearing, that remains my view.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have been able to observe for myself at first hand the demeanour which the applicant has displayed whilst giving her evidence over what is now the course of several days in the witness box.  She is, without doubt, an extremely anxious woman.  She worries constantly about all three of her children and, to be fair to her, not without reason since each in his or her own way has presented with various psychological difficulties and health problems.  I shall need to address in due course whether these concerns are overplayed or exaggerated in terms of the presentation of her case in relation to the children&#8217;s financial needs.  However, I have no doubt that the applicant herself does not have the reserves of emotional resilience which would have enabled her to forge ahead with further English proceedings in the immediate aftermath of the Russian order.  I am satisfied that the prospect of further litigation with the respondent at that stage would have been a daunting and potentially costly prospect, both in financial and emotional terms.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, that by itself is not an explanation for the degree of delay in this case.  I found in my earlier judgment that the applicant received no legal advice between the end of August 2009 and March 2012 when she consulted Francis Lindsay &amp; Co.  The issues which she had with that firm have been well rehearsed in the written evidence and, by and large, are not contested.  It appears to be uncontroversial that this (much smaller) firm which she instructed in place of Withers in order to manage costs more effectively did not have the equivalent experience of dealing with substantial financial cases involving international trusts.  There was then a dispute about a legal bill and the proposed instruction of counsel at a cost of some &#163;20,000.  The matter reached the desk of the Legal Ombudsman.  The applicant appears to have re-established contact with Mr Harper on 5 November 2012 and signed a formal retainer for his services on 25 November 2012. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> Initially, she said during the course of her oral evidence that she had contacted Mr Harper for reasons unconnected with her Part III claim.  She thought it was the receipt of a letter addressed to her from the solicitors acting for Kopt (the owner of the Kensington house).  That letter referred to the proposed changes to be effected by the forthcoming ATED<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings</p>
	      </authorialNote> tax legislation and the need to have the property valued.  Fearful that this valuation might signal some intention on the part of the trustees to sell the property, she said she had contacted Mr Harper.  When it was pointed out to her that this cannot have been the reason for her approach to Mr Harper since she would not have received the letter before 8 November 2012 (it was dated 7 November 2012), the applicant told me that Withers had written to her at some point in 2012 to inform her that a restriction which she had registered against Kopt&#8217;s property in Wycombe Square was still in force.  She thought that it might have been in the context of a discussion about that letter that she told Mr Harper about the letter from Speechly Bircham, Kopt&#8217;s solicitors.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In any event, Mr Harper at Withers was formally reinstructed by 25 November 2012.  It is at this point that the chronology in relation to delay becomes important because Mr Marks and Miss Cowton invite me to find that the ensuing delay was caused as a result of the applicant&#8217;s lack of success in finding a buyer for her Moscow apartment and was purely tactical.  It is common ground that she put the Russian property on the market for sale at the beginning of February 2013 on the basis of an asking price of US$8.6 million.  In that same month, the lien which her previous solicitors were exercising over her file came to an end when matters were resolved with assistance from the Legal Ombudsman.  It was suggested to the applicant in cross-examination that Mr Harper could do nothing further to progress her Part III claim at that stage because he must be presumed to have advised his client that her prospects of success in English litigation would be significantly enhanced if she had by then severed her remaining financial connection with Russia.  It is suggested that this was the reason why she began to market the Moscow apartment in February 2013 and why no further action was taken in relation to the Part III proceedings until after the sale of that property in May 2014 at a reduced price of US$6.2 million.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Her evidence was that the Russian property market was highly volatile in the period after the Russian order of 2009.  There was much speculative marketing by vendors at vastly inflated prices.  She took the view that it made better sense to have her property investment in the central London market where two smaller flats would be much easier to let with a guaranteed income stream.  The Moscow apartment had taken so long to sell precisely because of the prevailing uncertainty in the Russian housing market at the time.  She had negotiated a sale at a price of just over US$6 million (as against 2009 valuation of US$5.1 million and an initial asking price of c. $8.6 million) but her purchaser pulled out of the sale at the last minute.  She was able to resurrect the deal about a month later and the property was finally sold at the end of April or the beginning of May 2014 for RUB 221.6 million (or US$6.2 million gross, or US$4.9 million net).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, Mr Harper is a solicitor who is well known both to this court and to the two legal teams instructed by the parties.  Throughout most of his involvement in the case as the applicant&#8217;s solicitor, he was employed as a partner at Withers.  As such, he had considerable knowledge and expertise of trust issues in the context of matrimonial proceedings.  Throughout the course of his instruction in these Part III proceedings, both before and after the formal issue of the claim, there was never any suggestion of or reference to duress or undue pressure by the respondent as a reason for his client&#8217;s psychological inability to progress matters.   They did not feature in any of the witness statements prepared by Withers, nor were they particularised in her Form E, other than to the extent I have set out above.  The statement of issues which was prepared whilst Mr Harper&#8217;s hand was on the professional tiller was silent on this aspect of her case.  There was no consideration at the pre-trial review in December 2015 of the need for any medical evidence to support a case related to duress and its psychological consequences for the applicant.  The case management directions which I made on that occasion were anchored to entirely different matters.  It was only after the applicant transferred her instructions to Vardags in January 2016 shortly before the commencement of the Stage I hearing that these issues and medical evidence became a bone of contention in the case.  By the time she issued an application under Part 25 for permission to rely on medical evidence, the litigation had been up and running for almost two years.  There had been four substantive court hearings during the course of which the court had never been asked to consider directions in relation to this aspect of her case.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, I can find no reference in the evidence whatsoever from either Mr Harper or the Russian lawyers employed by the applicant in 2009 about the pressure under which she says she was put by the respondent.  I readily accept that this wife found the Russian proceedings stressful.  It is reasonably clear from what they have both said that, by the time of the agreement in 2009, they had lost the sympathy of the Russian judge who appears to have become frustrated by their inability to settle matters.  The applicant herself accepts that she took the deal which was then on the table in order to secure a degree of financial stability for herself and the children whilst (on her case) she returned to resolve issues of her future housing in London in England.  These are matters which I have covered already in my Stage I judgment.  I am prepared to accept that part of the pressure she felt in the Russian proceedings flowed from the judge&#8217;s threat to involve the domestic tax authorities in what might have appeared to be tax evasion in relation to the trust arrangements (which I accept were brought to his attention informally).  However, that pressure was not operating on the applicant once the 2009 agreement was concluded.  On her own case, she needed a period or window of recuperation after 2009.  She had the support of Mr Harper during the period leading up to the agreement in Russia; she had been provided with extensive documentation about the trusts.  She had spent the best part of &#163;200,000 on securing that advice.  Had she been left in a state of complete psychological collapse in 2009, as she alleges, it is difficult to see how Mr Harper would not have known about it and put down a clear marker on behalf of his client.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the meantime, relying on the clean break provisions across all jurisdictions which he believed he had secured within the context of the Russian agreement (and I am prepared to find that this was his subjective interpretation of what was reflected in the Russian order), the respondent and Dr Z put in place a tax efficient restructuring of the various family trusts.  Mr Todd and Mr Yates point to the fact that, by the end of 2013, a sum of some US$36.8 million had been distributed to the respondent.  By the beginning of 2014, Dr Z was putting further arrangements in place by way of a reorganisation of his trust structure.  In my judgment, it is not without note that these arrangements included financial provision on his death for <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">each</span> of the respondent&#8217;s former wives, including the applicant.   By now his surviving son had remarried.  He was responsible for three more children (including his stepson) and a very young daughter whose health in early 2013 was of sufficient concern that she was taken to the United States for urgent medical treatment.  Indeed, part of the restructuring was undertaken, as I accept, to anticipate the possibility that, with his new family, he might need to relocate permanently to the United States in which event there would be (or might have been) adverse tax consequences for the Trust given his status as a potential beneficiary.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Marks and Miss Cowton suggest that the real trigger for the applicant&#8217;s current application in mid-2014 was a combination of her sale of the Moscow apartment and her becoming aware of the improvement in the respondent&#8217;s position in relation to the trusts.  They point to the fact that she has never provided a proper explanation for the delay from February 2013 when the papers were released to Withers prior to the issue of proceedings.  The fact that the applicant&#8217;s previous solicitors were exercising a lien on the file to that point in time would not, of itself, have prevented Mr Harper from getting on with matters since he had access to his previous file and knew the identity of the applicant&#8217;s Russian lawyers.  On receipt of the papers, and no doubt on the applicant&#8217;s instruction (or lack of instruction), he did nothing to instigate proceedings for a period of about 17 months. In these circumstances, I am invited to find that the knowledge which he would have had about the potential consequences of delay and the absence of any enduring connections with this jurisdiction prior to her purchase of the two flats must point towards advice which he would have given her.  This, they submit, is the true reason for the delay and her attempts now to embellish her case with a lengthy catalogue of complaints about her poor health is simply a fa&#231;ade.  To quote from paragraph 29 of Mr Marks&#8217; and Miss Cowton&#8217;s closing submissions, they submit that:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applicant&#8217;s oral evidence was that she had been attempting to sell her Russian apartment for more than four years although there is no specific reference to this in any of her statements.  The documents which she has produced show that agents became involved in the marketing exercise for the first time in February 2013.  She told me that from 2010 until 2013 she had been attempting to sell the property informally because <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;that is how it is done in Moscow&#8221;</span>.  She said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I knew I needed money and had to sell the Moscow property.  It was depreciating and losing money.&#8221;  </span>When it was put to her by Mr Marks in cross-examination that she was fully aware that the retention of the Moscow apartment would be a problem for her in pursuing a claim in this jurisdiction, she said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I am much simpler than you think.  It did not cross my mind.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is an undisputed fact in these proceedings that the English litigation commenced just over 12 weeks after the sale of the Russian apartment.  Her statement in support of the permission application was signed the day before formal issue.  It is reasonable to suppose that the preparation of that statement following an attendance on the applicant was undertaken by her solicitors at least a week before issue, if not earlier.  Thus, in the context of a delay of more than five years, there is a striking proximity between the sale of the property and the issue of proceedings.  Against the background of what had already been a lengthy period of delay on her part, is this simple coincidence, as the applicant would have me believe ?  Is it mere coincidence that it was at precisely this point in time that she felt strong enough psychologically to contemplate further litigation with the respondent after a delay of what had already been almost five years ?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I recognised in my earlier judgment that the delay had to be seen against the background of the continuing concerns which were being expressed by Withers after the conclusion of the Russian divorce proceedings.  In particular, I referred to the letter which Mr Harper had written to the trustees&#8217; solicitors at the beginning of March 2013 putting them on notice that his client was concerned about the terms of her continuing occupation of the Kensington house (paragraph 150).   Nothing happened as a result of that salvo or after the reply from Harcus Sinclair on 21 March 2013<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="6">

A long period of inactivity followed until whatever date it was upon which the applicant instructed them to prepare the application which was issued some 14 or 15 months later.  What is clear from Harcus Sinclair&#8217;s letter of 21 March 2013 is that the applicant had no formal notice by that stage of any improvement in the respondent&#8217;s financial position.</p>

I also found that, after the instruction of Francis Lindsay &amp; Co in March 2012 and her subsequent reinstruction of Withers in February 2013, she was actively engaged in seeking advice in relation to her claims (paragraph 152).</p>

I am prepared to accept that, having established family life in London at least for the foreseeable future, she may well have decided it would be a better financial investment to move her capital out of Russia at a time when the property market in that country was becoming increasingly volatile.  However, I am unable to accept that there was not at least an element of tactical delay in her procrastination and I agree with Mr Marks and Miss Cowton that such delay should fairly operate in a more conservative assessment of her future needs.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue of financial opportunism is less obvious to me and I make no specific finding in this regard over and above what I have said at the end of paragraph 50 above.  Mr Marks submits that part of the delay can be explained on the basis that the applicant was waiting until such time as she knew that there had been a significant improvement in the respondent&#8217;s financial position.  He points to the fact that, regardless of any formal disclosure, she would have known about his acquisition of the helicopter.  He points to the fact that his client has been prejudiced in these proceedings because of the changes to his financial position during the lengthy period of delay.  I am not persuaded that the applicant knew very much at all about the reorganisation of the trust structure over the intervening years.  She accepted in her evidence that she knew at the time of the Russian agreement that he was always likely to come into family money at some point in the future; she just did not know when.  Further, it has been her case throughout that, regardless of the structure within which the wealth was held, this was always &#8220;Z family money&#8221;.  It had sustained their lifestyle during the marriage and it continued to sustain the respondent&#8217;s lifestyle after its demise. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus there are two significant &#8216;brakes&#8217; or limiting factors in this case in terms of an assessment of her needs.  First, there is delay.  Secondly, there is the fact that the provenance of the wealth against which she is claiming is gifted or inherited wealth, none of which is the product of marital endeavour.  In my judgment, it is only fair and a principled approach to take into account the fact that her claims in this jurisdiction are made against non-matrimonial property many years after the formal breakdown of the marriage in circumstances where there has already been a formal court-approved division of the assets which were acquired during the marriage.  I agree with Mr Marks that the post-separation nature of the claims is potentially a significant clog on the value and extent of those claims.</p>

At one stage during his cross-examination of the respondent, Mr Todd had begun to explore whether or not full disclosure had been provided by the respondent.  This point arose as a result of the payment of a dividend to one of the corporate entities within the family structure and Mr Todd&#8217;s enquiry as to whether or not the majority corporate shareholder received the same aliquot share.  The respondent&#8217;s evidence was that the dividend was only payable to preference shareholders and not to ordinary shareholders.  On the basis of the evidence I have, I accept that this is not a case where there is further significant value in the trust structures which has been somehow kept beneath the radar in these proceedings.</p>

These funds provide for the income needs of himself and his wife, each of whom may have many more years of life in front of them.

He has a total of some &#163;2.85 million invested in property in London and Russia.  He is owed about &#163;2.5 million by BMT Capital.  His cash position outside the trusts is less than &#163;1 million.  Leaving aside the funds which are currently settled in the four trusts<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="8">

	      </authorialNote> which have been earmarked for the specific benefit of his current wife and children (including his stepson), he is a beneficiary of trust funds worth just less than &#163;19.5 million.     Included in this figure is the value of the Kensington House which is owned by the BMT Trust through Kopt.  The respondent became the new life tenant and Protector of this Trust on 19 December 2014 during the currency of these proceedings but he is unable to benefit directly in terms of appointments out of the Trust during the lifetime of his father, Dr Z.  The global figure of &#163;19.5 million also includes the value of the yacht which is owned by the BMT Generations Trust.  The Mezano Trust (which the respondent regards as his personal trust vehicle) holds just under &#163;8 million which includes the value of the respondent&#8217;s current home in Cyprus, a property which is considerably smaller than the Kensington House.</p>

I am told that Dr Z derives particular pleasure from the significant use which he makes of the yacht.  Since he is now retired and is the generator of the wealth in this case, it seems to me that he is fully entitled to indulge that pleasure.  Other family members use the yacht and, whether or not the running costs come from an account operated by the respondent or on the basis of pro rata family contributions, it is all family money at the end of the day.  I was told during the Stage I hearing, and again in this hearing, that Dr Z still has considerable influence as to how family money is spent and has told the respondent that expenditure for the entire family should not exceed $2 million per annum.  Clearly, that limit has been exceeded in the past year alone, as the evidence demonstrates.</p>

He cannot benefit from the BMT Trust or the BMT Generations Trust during the lifetime of his father and the BMT Legacy Trust (which holds just under &#163;1.2 million) has been designated by Dr Z as a fund for the benefit of various non-family third parties who have worked for him or otherwise deserved financial benefit on his death.  I have seen a copy of Dr Z&#8217;s letters of wishes in relation to this Trust and I am satisfied that it is unlikely that the respondent will see any financial benefit from this source over the coming years.</p>

There are two, interrelated, duties of the court before making an order under Part III.  The first is to consider whether England and Wales is the appropriate venue for the application: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(1)</ref>.  The second is to consider whether an order should be made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 17</ref> having regard to the matters in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/18" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18</ref>.  There are two reasons why the duties are interrelated.  First, neither <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref> nor <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/18/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18(2)</ref>(3) refers to an exhaustive list of matters to be taken into account.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 16(1)</ref> directs the court to have regard to &#8220;all the circumstances of the case&#8221; and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref> refers the court to certain matters &#8220;in particular&#8221;.  Second, some of the matters to be considered under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16</ref> may be relevant under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/18" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18</ref>, and vice versa.  An obvious example would be that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref>(e) refers the court to the financial provision which has been made by the foreign court.  Plainly that would be relevant under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/18" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18</ref>.  So also the direction in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/18/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18(6)</ref> to the court, in considering the financial resources of a party, to have regard to whether an order of the foreign court has been complied with would plainly be relevant in considering whether England is the appropriate venue.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in">It is not the purpose of Part III to allow a spouse (usually, in current conditions, the wife) with some English connections to make an application in England to take advantage of what may well be the more generous approach in England to financial provision, particularly in so-called big-money cases.  There is no condition of exceptionality for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16</ref>, but it will not usually be a case for an order under Part III where the wife had a right to apply for financial relief under the foreign law, and an award was made in that foreign country.  In such cases, mere disparity between that award and what would be awarded on an English divorce will certainly be insufficient to trigger the application of Part III.  Nor is hardship or injustice (much less serious injustice) a condition of the exercise of the jurisdiction, but if either factor is present, it may make it appropriate, in the light of all the circumstances, for an order to be made, and may affect the nature of the provision ordered.  Of course, the court will not lightly characterise foreign law, or the order of a foreign court, as unjust.</p>

		  <num style="font-weight:bold">73</num>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in">The amount of financial provision will depend on all the circumstances of the case and there is no rule that it should be the minimum amount required to overcome injustice.  The following general principles should be applied.  First, primary consideration must be given to the welfare of any children of the marriage.  This can cut both ways as the children may be being supported by the foreign spouse.  Second, it will never be appropriate to make an order which gives the claimant more than she or he would have been awarded had all the proceedings taken place within this jurisdiction.  Third, where possible the order should have the result that provision is made for the reasonable needs of each spouse.  Subject to these principles, the court has a broad discretion. The reasons why it was appropriate for an order to be made in England are among the circumstances to be taken into account in deciding what order should be made.  Where the English connections of the case are very strong there may be no reason why the application should not be treated as if it were made in purely English proceedings.  The full procedure for granting ancillary relief after an English divorce does not apply in Part III cases.  The conditions which can be attached to leave, together with the court&#8217;s case management powers, can be used to define the issues and to limit the evidence to be filed, as was done by Munby J in this case.  This enables the jurisdiction to be tailored to the needs of the individual case, so that the grant of leave does not inevitably trigger a full blown claim for all forms of ancillary relief.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">But a matter of weeks ago in mid-April 2016, the Court of Appeal was called upon to consider whether Parker J had been right to refuse permission to an Australian former wife who sought to make an application under Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>:  <span style="font-style:italic">De Renee v Galbraith-Marten </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2016/537" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCA Civ 537" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCA Civ 537</ref>.  That application was made in the context of previous Australian proceedings between the parties during the course of which various agreements had been reached some five years before the application was issued.  Those agreements were eventually embodied in a consent order which, unlike the position under English law, did not require the approval of the Australian court in order give its terms full legal effect.  The wife alleged that she had been placed under pressure by her former husband.  Parker J had refused her permission to proceed with a Part III application for two reasons.  First, the legal system and the principles which applied under Australian law were based on very similar principles to our own domestic law.  Secondly, the remedies open to the wife in Australia had already enabled her to ventilate her case on duress before an Australian judge (who had dismissed her application to set aside the consent order).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In their closing submissions, Mr Marks and Miss Cowton contended that the <span style="font-style:italic">Galbraith-Marten</span> case was &#8220;not wildly dissimilar&#8221; to the facts of this case aside from the fact that the competing jurisdiction was  Australia rather than Russia, and the wife in that case received AUS$172,500 as opposed to in excess of $10 million.  Delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Lady Justice Black set out the background and Parker J&#8217;s finding that &#8220;there was no gap which needed to be filled by the English court&#8221;.   Having recorded the general law in relation to Part III applications and the fact that &#8220;the threshold for granting permission is not high&#8221; (para 20), her Ladyship turned to consider the errors of legal approach which were said to have been made by Parker J. In that case, the agreements reached by the parties covered, separately, spousal maintenance, child maintenance and capital provision for the wife who had been represented by lawyers throughout.  It was not by any stretch a &#8220;big money&#8221; case or even one involving substantial assets.  The marriage had been short.  The wife&#8217;s spousal maintenance was to terminate when their child was 5 years old (a provision which the Court of Appeal found to be unsurprising (para 24)).  In terms of capital provision, the Court found that there was nothing in the material put before Parker J or the Court of Appeal which established that the provision made in the Australian agreements was in fact unfair (para 23) and hence the applicant had not made out her case that she was left in a situation of real need.  The Australian court had already rejected the wife&#8217;s allegation of duress. The final nail in the coffin for that wife was her ability to proceed with a formal application in the Australian courts had she considered that the pre-litigation agreements were unfair and failed to meet her needs as they were at the time.</p>

I accept that Lady Justice Black said, at paragraph 24 of her judgment, that it could properly be assumed that the Australian wife&#8217;s lawyers were looking after her interests at the time and, if they were not, that was a matter between her and them.   So, too, did she say that the fact that the wife had more need now would not be a reason to reopen a previous settlement which had been endorsed by the court and reflected in a consent order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, as I have already found, there was no realistic possibility of the Russian court embarking on an application of English law so as to deal with the trust aspects of the case.  As I said at paragraph 116, &#8220;&#8230; in terms of any claim she might wish to pursue in the Russian court in respect of the Kensington House, I am satisfied that, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">absent an application of English law by the Russian court</span>, the applicant had no apparent legal remedy in those courts&#8221;.  A fundamental element of the applicant&#8217;s future needs was the provision to be made for her housing.  She was then living in a trust property with the children of the family and her English lawyers had advertised the likelihood of a Part III claim before the Russian agreement received the assent of the Russian court.  I shall need to consider separately whether the capital provision which was made for her was adequate to deal prospectively with her housing needs once the arrangement in relation to the Kensington house came to an end.  It must be borne in mind that, at the time of the Russian agreement in 2009, there was no formal offer from the respondent which would have allowed her to remain in the property for a further 13 years in accordance with the terms of his present offer.  All she had by way of security at that stage was the assurance from the Trust&#8217;s solicitors that, as a tenant, she would be given notice of any intended sale of the property although no such sale was then foreseen.  Only a matter of days after the Russian agreement was lodged in the Russian court, and on the very same day when the Russian court converted the agreement into an order, the applicant was required to sign an agreement with Kopt (as her landlord) extending her tenancy of the Kensington house for a further three years, terminating in August 2012 at which point their youngest child would have been 12 years old and only at the beginning of his secondary school education.  I accept, as I recorded in paragraph 141 of my Stage I judgment, that she must be presumed to have relied to an extent on subsequent assurances which I found that the respondent gave to her that she could remain at the Kensington property until the children were no longer minors. But no such provision appeared in either the agreement or the order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was no investigation by the Russian court at all into the circumstances of her occupation of the Kensington house.   Whilst the judge was aware that she lived overseas, he was given no formal disclosure in relation to the trust structure although, on an informal basis, he was made aware of its existence.  Mr Marks and Miss Cowton quite rightly point to the fact that the respondent&#8217;s current entitlement to trust assets had not crystallised at that point in time.  There was a background of significant family wealth and what appears to be a common expectation as between the parties that he would in future benefit from further dispositions of that wealth.   However, the focus of the submissions made on behalf of the respondent, as in the Stage I hearing, is on the likely outcome in an English court had it been seised in 2009 of claims arising under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>. </p>

This is not a case where her needs have increased during the intervening period as a result of changes in her personal or financial circumstances.  As Mr Marks readily accepts, save for the impact of costs, her capital position has been largely maintained despite the fact that she lost money on one particular investment and paid her sister a sum of $100,000 for design services she provided in respect of the Moscow apartment prior to its sale.  The applicant accepts that her investment portfolio has performed well over the years (and she has paid some fairly heavy management charges to the professionals who have looked after the investments on her behalf).  In addition she told me that she has made a number of economies in her domestic expenditure in order to preserve as much capital as she could.</p>

Even if the terms of the agreement were fair in the light of the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">then</span> prevailing circumstances, that fact, of itself, is not necessarily a bar to an effective Part III claim provided that the English court considers it &#8220;appropriate&#8221; in all the circumstances to make an order.  The tension here (as so often) lies in the twin objectives of achieving finality in litigation and fairness of outcome in circumstances as they are found to be at the time an application is made.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the applicant, Mr Todd and Mr Yates submit that, had an English judge been looking at these claims in the context of an English divorce, it is very likely that, in the absence of an extraction of the Kensington house from the BMT Trust at that point in time, their client&#8217;s claims for lump sum provision would have been adjourned.  The English court would have had the ability to examine in close forensic detail the trust issues and the existence of family wealth as a specific resource which was available to these parties during the currency of the marriage as a result of Dr Z&#8217;s generosity.  It would have been in a position to consider whether it was reasonably foreseeable that the respondent&#8217;s (then) existing wealth was likely to be augmented in the not too distant future as a result of his father making further provision for his son, whether through tax efficient trust structures or by means of outright disposition.  They contend that the very existence of the trust property (i.e. the Kensington house) occupied, as it was, by the applicant and the children as a family home and the future arrangements in respect of that property would have been central to the court&#8217;s enquiry as to her future needs.  In a similar way, the English court in 2009 could have considered claims for spousal maintenance and could have reached a balanced judgment as to whether the capital provision which a division of the Russian assets produced was sufficient to justify the termination of her future income claims in the light of (a) the further contributions which she would be making to the children&#8217;s welfare under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25(2)</ref>(f), and (b) the likely extent of any resources which might be available to the respondent in the foreseeable future.  It appears to be common ground as between the applicant and the respondent that the concept of spousal maintenance is not one which is generally recognised in Russian divorce proceedings.</p>

I do so conscious that the purpose of Parliament in drafting the legislation was to protect a former party to a marriage who has substantial connections with England from the adverse consequences of a foreign court order made in divorce proceedings in circumstances where that order made no, or inadequate, financial provision for that party or the children of the family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applicant was a former party to a marriage.  In my judgment, her connections with this jurisdiction are &#8216;substantial&#8217; for these purposes.  Notwithstanding my earlier finding that there was a degree of tactical delay in the issue of her Part III application, there can be little room for argument that, by July 2014, London was her home and the centre of operations as far as family life was concerned.  Not only had it always been the parties&#8217; joint wish and intention that their children should be raised and educated in central London, the applicant&#8217;s evidence (which I accept) is that she intends to make England her home for the foreseeable future.  She wishes to maintain a home in London so that she can continue to provide a family base as and when it may be required by her adult children when they visit with their partners and, in due course, her grandchildren.  I am satisfied that she has no current plans to return to Russia but is firmly grounded here in terms of her friends, her social life and the daily pattern of the children&#8217;s lives.  It may be that one or more of the children will wish to study in an American university.  It may be that professional advice will be sought in another jurisdiction in relation to the children&#8217;s medical treatment. Neither of those factors dilutes or weakens the attachment which this family in its present constitution has, and is likely to continue to have, to England which is a permanent home to all four of its members.  The fact that the respondent has framed his current offer in terms of the guaranteed provision of a family home in London throughout the children&#8217;s minorities is further confirmation of that substantial connection and his acknowledgment of it.   Whilst his own connection with Russia has not been extinguished since 2009, the respondent&#8217;s connections with his country of birth have certainly weakened over the passage of time.  He now divides his time between homes in Cyprus and Bulgaria.  He told me that he is anxious to ensure that his father, Dr Z, leaves Russia to relocate to Europe at some point in the future.  Whilst <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">he</span> retains a modest property in Moscow, the applicant now has no property or financial anchor in that jurisdiction despite the fact that she still has family members living in Russia whom she will doubtless wish to visit from time to time,</p>

Their elder sister is now 18 and, although she is attending college and living in a rented flat provided for her by the respondent, I accept the applicant&#8217;s evidence that she returns home frequently and a bedroom is kept for her use at the Kensington house.  Each of these three children has experienced medical and other problems over the course of their lives.   The older daughter and the son have inherited the congenital heart condition from which their father suffers although, happily, he himself appears to be asymptomatic.  It is common ground that their youngest child and only son experiences the more severe symptoms of the two whilst their elder daughter&#8217;s problems appear to be driven by psychological difficulties which she has experienced over a number of years.  I am told that she is progressing well academically and has aspirations to attend a university in  England. It is likely that the two younger children will wish to study in the US. In due course, I shall address their specific financial needs in the context of the competing budgets which are advanced by their parents.</p>

I am satisfied that the terms of the Russian order have been implemented in full; each of the applicant and the respondent has complied with their obligations under its terms.  I bear well in mind that this is not one of those cases where the English court is starting from scratch with a blank piece of paper.  The Russian proceedings were properly and lawfully constituted; the applicant was engaged and legally represented in those proceedings.  Whatever the arguments about the circumstances in which her consent to that agreement was procured, it is unarguable that her lawyers did nothing outside the sanctum of legal professional privilege to dissuade her from signing up to its terms or preventing the court&#8217;s formal endorsement of its terms.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Marks and Miss Cowton have produced a helpful table in which they have set out what each of the parties received as a result of the Russian order in 2009.  The applicant retained a sum of c.US$5 million in cash which was the balance of monies extracted by means of loans from the trust structure which had been paid into her bank accounts.  The respondent retained his cash savings of c.US$120,000.  Thus, I accept that she retained what Mr Marks described as &#8220;the vast bulk of their cash&#8221;.  In addition she retained the more valuable of their Russian properties.  I have already referred to the Moscow apartment which was sold in April/May 2014 together with a parking space for US$6.2 million gross.  In 2009, that property was valued at US$5,080,000 gross (US$3.4 million net).  The property which the respondent retained was then worth US$2,080,000.  (Although there has been no recent updating, his Russian properties now have a combined value of US$2,374,183 or &#163;1,606,400.)</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to their respective positions in terms of future benefit from the trust structure, the applicant had the annuity provision which, on the respondent&#8217;s death during her lifetime, would have given her an income for life of US$20,000 per month or US$240,000 per annum. (In my judgment, if nothing else, provision at that level for the applicant herself tells me something about Dr Z&#8217;s expectation of the standard of living she should be entitled to enjoy in circumstances where she was widowed prematurely.)  The respondent&#8217;s expectations were far greater in terms of future access to independent wealth although any benefits to which he might be entitled had not crystallised and were contingent on the death of his father, Dr Z.  It is the respondent&#8217;s case that, whilst these future trust interests were not referred to on the face of the Russian order, they were clearly taken into account by him if not by the applicant.  From his perception, it is said that he would never have agreed to what was effectively a 4:1 split<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="11">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> The actual division of the Russian assets left the applicant with US$8.4 million (79%) plus the annuity and the respondent with US$2.2 million (21%) plus his trust interests contingent on Dr Z&#8217;s death.</p>
	      </authorialNote> in the applicant&#8217;s favour had he not anticipated future financial benefit from the trusts and/or his father.  In parallel with the Russian order, he was also agreeing to discharge the substantial rental payments due to Kopt in respect of the Kensington house, together with the payment of the children&#8217;s maintenance and private education in London.  Those financial obligations, submits Mr Marks, are not ones which he would or could have undertaken unless he knew he had financial expectations over and above the assets he then held in his sole name.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems to me that there is some force in the submission that <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">both</span> parties had, to an extent, marginalised any future consideration of the trust aspects of the case when agreeing to sign up to their Russian agreement.  For his part, I accept that the respondent, who had always relied to an extent on his father&#8217;s bounty, must have had the hope &#8211; if not expectation &#8211; that this generous financial lifeline would continue during his parents&#8217; lifetime and that eventually the trust assets would pass to him on his father&#8217;s death.  It is equally clear, in my judgment, that the applicant must have proceeded on that basis to an extent because, in terms of his future financial obligations to her and the children, she knew that he had no remunerative employment as such and was closely aligned financially with his father&#8217;s affairs.  That assertion and his consequent ability to influence decision-making lies at the very heart of her case.  W&#8217;s case was that she was postponing consideration of any future entitlement she might have in terms of continuing rights of occupation and/or the acquisition of a beneficial interest in the Kensington house to await her return to England.  She was well aware at the time that her English lawyers were &#8216;up to speed&#8217; with the trust position.  They had already been sent the &#8216;bible&#8217; of trust documents some six months before the date of the agreement and had advertised through correspondence the need to formalise the terms of her occupation of the property.  She confirmed in her oral evidence during the Stage I hearing that she was aware when she did the Russian deal that it was likely that the respondent was going to come into further family money in the future.  She also confirmed when she was re-examined by Mr Marshall QC (her leading counsel at the time) that she knew he was likely to benefit from assets held within the BMT Trust (which owned the Kensington house) although not <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;there and then&#8221;</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On one view there is significant merit in this context in the argument developed by Mr Todd and Mr Yates on behalf of the applicant that an English court would not recognise the Russian agreement as one which would survive the <span style="font-style:italic">Radmacher </span>test had this been a purely English divorce.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is even more difficult to see how an English <span style="font-style:italic">Radmacher </span>test <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">could</span> have been applied in the Russian proceedings even if that court had been prepared to apply English law.  I accept that by this stage the applicant had been provided through Mr Harper with information about the trusts.  However there was no formal disclosure in the Russian proceedings of the nature or extent of the respondent&#8217;s present or likely future entitlement to trust assets and, if applying English law, <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi </span>the Russian court would have had to look at resources which included present and (likely) future trust benefits which might flow in the respondent&#8217;s direction.  In this context, an application of the <span style="font-style:italic">Radmacher </span>test is wider than a broad assessment of whether the actual capital division of assets on the basis of their then values looked fair when viewed objectively.  Whilst I accept that the applicant was being advised by Russian lawyers at the time, they cannot be presumed to have any professional expertise in relation to the implications of his future beneficial entitlement to substantial wealth from this source.  The expert evidence which I heard during the Stage I proceedings was that Russian law as applied in matrimonial courts does not even recognise the legal concept of beneficial ownership or the holding of assets through the mechanism of a trust.  The broad canvass of an English divorce court, by contrast, would have entailed a careful consideration of these matters and they would have been taken into account to whatever extent was thought appropriate in 2009 had the proceedings been ongoing in this jurisdiction at the time.  Thus, whilst the provision which was made for the applicant on the basis of the assets which they held at that time would be likely to have survived a &#8220;fairness health check&#8221;, both the applicant and the respondent were fully aware that the issue of her continuing occupation of the Kensington house had yet to be agreed.  The respondent&#8217;s email, copied to his father, quite properly acknowledged that, in this context, she was an integral part of the children&#8217;s lives and their needs required her presence with them in the family home for many years into the future.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the applicant&#8217;s understanding about her spousal maintenance claims, I remain less convinced about the position in terms of the evidence which she gave me.  It is clear from the face of the Russian order that it purported to effect a clean break in relation to any future financial claims which she might have against the respondent for financial support in her capacity as a former spouse.  She told me during the Stage I hearing that she understood at the time that she was relinquishing these claims as part and parcel of the agreement.  I was careful to check with her that I had properly understood and recorded the response which she gave to that question through her interpreter which was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Yes absolutely; I understood I would not have claims for maintenance&#8221;</span>.  She was able to respond in English and she told me that she knew that this was the effect of the Russian agreement.  By the time we came to the present hearing, she was attempting to row back from that position.  She said that she had found it very difficult to answer questions in court given the degree of pressure which she felt.  She said she had misunderstood the question I asked when I sought her confirmation on this point.  I am afraid that I cannot accept that evidence.  She was not under any inappropriate pressure during the course of that hearing.  Of course I accept that litigation in the High Court over several days brings its own tensions and strains.  However, that particular aspect of her evidence was clear; it was repeated; and expressly clarified.  I agree with Mr Marks that this aspect of her case and her wish to retract the meaning or sense of what she said was not a case which could have been run had Mr Marshall, her previous leading counsel, been involved in this hearing.  There is no doubt in my mind that both my note of her evidence and the record contained in the transcript of that hearing is accurate.  In these circumstances, I have no difficulty in finding that, whilst she may have anticipated further litigation in England in relation to her occupation of the Kensington house despite the <span style="font-style:italic">contra mundum </span>clause in the Russian order, she had in 2009 accepted the capital settlement and the retention of the US$5 million in the full knowledge that her own maintenance claims were being swept up in that settlement. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Marks and Miss Cowton remind me that the respondent has &#163;32.9 million of which &#163;10.2 million is not available to him during his father&#8217;s lifetime.  The applicant has already received &#163;5.1 million (on the basis of 2009 values) as well as the benefit of the Kensington house on a rent free basis.  They contend this provision is more than enough to meet her needs in the light of the respondent&#8217;s offer to fund the new lease.  She has already taken her portion of the Z wealth in the Russian proceedings and they invite me once again in the context of these Stage II proceedings to reject her amended claims for what they are: a second (and impermissible) bite at the cherry.  At the time of the Russian agreement and order, there was only one trust &#8211; the BMT Trust &#8211; and all other trust interests which have been disclosed during the course of these proceedings post-date the end of their marriage and lack any nuptial element.  Although the respondent is <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">now</span> the beneficiary of the BMT Trust, he only became a beneficiary after the marriage was dissolved and the terms of the trust do not permit him to benefit from it during the lifetime of his father.  They accept that her <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">occupancy</span> of the Kensington house can be extended by the court but they submit that it cannot interfere with ownership.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This, they argue, is a powerful factor pointing to the fairness of the Russian order.  If the court cannot now extract the property from the trust by way of variation of a nuptial settlement, it certainly could not have done so were it seised of divorce proceedings in 2009.  Whilst the court can now put in place an order to incentivise the respondent (and the trustee) to extract the property on a voluntary basis (i.e. a lump sum &#8216;unless&#8217; order), the assets which would be required to fund such a lump sum did not exist in 2009.  To an extent, this proposition is accepted by Mr Todd and Mr Yates who contend, as I have said, that an adjournment of the applicant&#8217;s claims for lump sum orders would have been a highly likely outcome in any English proceedings in 2009.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems to me that the limited interest which the respondent had in the wider family wealth through the trust structure as it was set up in 2009 has to be seen against the background of a reasonably long marriage during the latter years of which this couple and their children lived, and lived well, on &#8216;Z&#8217; family money.  As I have said, it is not suggested that the respondent supported his family independently of the funds which his father made available.  It seems to me that, to an extent, the churn of family money through the conduit of the respondent has, in one sense, been no more than a continuation of the pattern of Dr Z&#8217;s bounty.  In my judgment, the submission which is made by Mr Marks and Miss Cowton about the post-separation nature of the wealth which the respondent now holds has to be seen in this context.  Of course, I accept, as I said during the course of the hearing, that it may well be that Dr Z would not have agreed to channel his wealth through the new (post-2009) trust structures had he not been assured that the terms of the Russian order represented a full and final settlement as between his son and former daughter-in-law.  </p>

It will require the applicant to discharge the general costs of living in that home with provision for child support throughout that period, but otherwise her occupation of that property with the children will be cost-free in terms of mortgage/rental payments.  His offer requires her to leave that home once the children have &#8220;grown and flown&#8221;.  Mr Marks and Miss Cowton have sought to demonstrate by reference to a further schedule that she will have sufficient resources of her own at that point in time to purchase another more suitable home (albeit a cheaper property) and to live reasonably comfortably for the remainder of her life with the capital she now has together with the injection of a further &#163;1 million from the trustees for the surrender of her annuity entitlement.  The applicant, in her turn, seeks to retain the property by means of an outright transfer from the trust through the variation of that settlement which she invites me to make under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24(1)</ref>(c) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>.  If this is not possible, her original proposal contained an offer to accept a cash sum of &#163;4.9 million which she would use to purchase an equivalent property in the same neighbourhood.  On the basis that she retains her existing &#8220;Russian&#8221; capital, she seeks no further provision in respect of a capitalised spousal maintenance fund.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the basis of the evidence which is currently before the court, I cannot predict what these children&#8217;s needs might be when that point in time comes.  I do not know; the applicant does not know; the respondent does not know.  The indications at present are that their elder daughter is beginning to come through her difficulties and her stated intentions with respect to her tertiary education is to attend a university in England for the three or four years of the next stage of her education.  She is living independently in separate rented accommodation now and appears to be coping well in that situation.  It is more difficult to predict what the future holds for the two younger children.  Each is functioning well in mainstream schooling.  Judging by the amount of additional tuition which the applicant is asking the respondent to pay for, the breadth and range of their subjects at school is extensive.  Whilst I accept that part of these tuition costs relates to extra help with preparing for important upcoming examinations, a significant element of the proposed tuition budget relates to learning new languages, including Japanese.  It seems to me that a young person who is capable of absorbing this additional language skill is likely to be a child who is equipped to make his or her own way in the world subject always to remaining well and in good physical health.</p>

However, &#8220;needs&#8221; is an elastic concept which has to be considered against all the circumstances of the particular case with which the court is dealing.  Initially Mr Todd and Mr Yates sought to persuade me that their client&#8217;s delay made little, if any, difference to an assessment of her needs.  Whilst there was some retreat from that position by the time we reached closing submissions, I do not accept that delay can be air-brushed out of the picture.  It will inevitably find reflection in the award which I make at the conclusion of these proceedings.  It is one of the factors which I am required to take into account: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 16(2)</ref>(i) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>.  As I have said, in my judgment, the manner in which the element of delay should be reflected in any final award is by the application of a much more conservative assessment of her current and future needs.  That will not be so in every case.  Sometimes, where the delay is insignificant or where there is a good explanation for any delay in issuing proceedings, the court may decide that its impact on a case will be minimal if, indeed, it impacts at all.  Here, delay is a significant factor and the applicant has already received significant provision in terms of the Z family capital which she received in 2009.</p>

So in my view she has made a very large contribution to this family.  She has much less good prospects than the husband&#8217;s so far as her future is concerned &#8230;.&#8221;.</p>

The essence of their case in relation to her future housing needs once the children have completed their tertiary education is that there should be a step-down and that she has sufficient resources now to afford to purchase suitable alternative accommodation at that stage.  In contrast, Mrs Hanlon was faced with the prospect of being unable to afford to buy anything at all if the family home was sold.  They submit that the dicta of Ormrod LJ has nothing to do with &#8220;scaling down&#8221; and has to be seen in the light of contemporary society mores where adult children can, and often do, lead independent lives away from their former family home long before the point of being &#8220;married and settled&#8221;.   They argue that the Kensington house is simply too large and too expensive to represent her long term housing needs beyond a further six years when she is likely to be living in the property for most of the time on her own.</p>

He says that a move away from central Kensington to a property costing in the region of &#163;2 million to &#163;2.25 million (gross cost &#163;2.5 million) meets her needs at a time in her life when she would in all likelihood be looking to move to a smaller property in any event.  He submits it is a logical time for her to move in circumstances where her initial objections to a move now are based on the proximity of her current home to transport and the children&#8217;s schools.  Under the respondent&#8217;s proposals, her current domestic infrastructure will be kept in place until that need falls away.  Should she wish to stay closer to Kensington, a housing budget at that level will allow her to do so, albeit at the expense of the size of the property she can afford.

I can see for myself from the colour brochures with which I was provided that all of his particulars relate to reasonably substantial family homes which have been modernised and refurbished to an apparently high standard.  Each appears to have modern, up to date (if not state of the art) kitchens and bathrooms.  They are pleasant, light and airy properties which I am satisfied would provide the applicant with the space which she says she wants to accommodate the family after they have ceased to live at home on a full-time basis.</p>

Whilst these matters are always a question of individual preference and taste, I can see from the internal colour photographs of the property that, whilst a large and comfortable family home, some of the internal specifications (such as the bathrooms and kitchen) may well require updating at some point in the future.  Without doubt, this home has represented a haven of security for the applicant during a difficult period in her life.  She tells me that she wants to retain this particular property as a long term home or, if that is not possible, she wishes to acquire something similar in the same area.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If that submission was being made in the context of a clean sheet of paper and fresh English divorce proceedings, very different considerations might apply.  As Lord Collins acknowledged in <span style="font-style:italic">Agbaje</span>, there will be cases where the English connections of the case are so strong that a Part III application can be treated as if it were made in purely English proceedings.  That might well be the case where, for example, there had been no financial award at all at the conclusion of a foreign divorce in circumstances where the family&#8217;s home had been London for many years.  Here, I have to bear in mind that a properly constituted Russian divorce and a consent order made in those proceedings are important features of the background circumstances of this case.  The outcome of the Russian proceedings was, by agreement, a substantial award of capital to the applicant.  As part of the agreement which underpinned that award, she recognised and acknowledged that she would have no further maintenance claims against the respondent.  Were she to receive by way of top up provision in these proceedings a transfer of the Kensington house, her global award would amount to c. US$17.7 million including the &#163;1 million offered now by the trustees.  As Mr Marks and Miss Cowton point out, that is the equivalent of 103% of what they then had in 2009 if the current value of the Kensington house is included.  It seems to me that this outcome teeters perilously close to the impermissible step of making an award in these proceedings which is in excess of what an English court would or could have awarded at the time.  On one view, it constitutes precisely such a step. The most which Mr Todd and Mr Yates can reasonably point to in this context is the absence of certainty as to the nature and timing of any benefits which might come to the respondent with the likely result of an adjournment of her lump sum claims in 2009.  Even they do not contend for a hypothetical outcome in the English court would have left the respondent with nothing over and above his future expectations.</p>

The focus of Mr Marks&#8217; challenge to her figures in cross-examination was the inclusion in her own budget of a significant element of expenditure which related to the children&#8217;s needs.  In terms of food, groceries and holidays, he suggested that part of her proposed expenditure related to their needs.  In addition, he suggested that the sum of just under &#163;21,000 which she was claiming for the cost of therapy could reasonably be reduced to &#163;9,400 (or &#163;200 per week) on the basis of a broad view of her needs in the future.  (&#163;200 per week in fact produces &#163;10,400 per annum rather than &#163;9,400 unless Mr Marks and Miss Cowton have been working on a reduced number of sessions over holiday and other periods.)  The applicant herself accepted that the figure she had provided for dental work was not sustainable on an annual basis.  She had claimed over &#163;17,000 per annum as the cost of taking accountancy and tax advice.  However, it appeared that this sum included a significant element of the charges which she was incurring in respect of the management of investments by her portfolio manager.  A sum of about &#163;18,500 per annum was being claimed for the costs of tax and employing a litigation friend, someone who appeared to have been helping her with the absorbing and understanding the volume of legal documents which this case has generated over the past two years or so.</p>

She had not included anything for holidays in their budget.  However, what she sought was just over &#163;33,600 per annum for holidays and weekends for herself.  Whilst I am not persuaded that Mr Todd&#8217;s repeated references to the respondent&#8217;s &#8220; helicopters and yachts&#8221; is a fixed reference point for considering his client&#8217;s needs, I cannot ignore altogether the fact that he has the resources to indulge his own interests in motor racing, flying and sailing whilst her spending patterns are much more modest.  She told me that, over and above the &#163;3,000 per month which he has been providing for the children in cash terms, she has had to deplete her capital to make good any shortfall.  In my judgment, the particular circumstances of this Part III claim call for a more nuanced approach.  Whilst their marital standard of living is one of the factors which is engaged in this stage of the discretionary exercise, it has to be tempered by a consideration of both what she has already received and the significant delay in progressing with her claims to the prejudice of the respondent. There is no question of any suggestion of parity in this case, and the applicant does not pursue an award at that level.</p>

As I have already noted earlier in my judgment, there is no guarantee in this case that their particular needs may not continue to occupy at least part of her time and energies to a point beyond the end of the formal education.   We simply do not know at this stage of events.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having considered matters carefully against the background of all the evidence which I have heard and read, I have reached the clear conclusion that the future housing needs of the applicant and the children can, and should be, met by the use of the Kensington house until their youngest child completes his tertiary education.  He will celebrate his 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> birthday in May 2022 although I suspect that he will not graduate until the summer of that year.  The applicant can at that stage begin her search for her new home and I have no doubt that she will by then be in a much better position to know what she needs and what she is looking for in terms of both area and space.  She will have had time to consider her options because I suspect that during the preceding two or three years, the only full-time occupants of the Kensington house will have been mother and son.  Given everything I know about this case and taking account of all the factors set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 16</ref>, 17, 18(2) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>, as well as those listed in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>, I am entirely persuaded that a step down in her accommodation needs at that juncture is both necessary and appropriate.  The provision of the Kensington house for her use and the use of the children on a rent free basis (i.e. at no cost to her) is entirely appropriate during the intervening period.  I would like to ensure that her occupancy of that home is maintained slightly beyond May 2022 and would encourage the respondent and Kopt/the trustees of the BMT Trust to agree to postpone the end of fixed term tenancy until the beginning of the new academic year in September 2022.  By that stage, their son will have completed his final year of a first degree. It will give her the summer months to make her arrangements for a move, although I hope and expect that she will have embarked upon the house-hunting process well in advance of a planned move.  She needs time to explore different areas or, if she is insistent on remaining in the area where she currently lives, to look at smaller properties in that area.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the sum she can reasonably expect to spend on a new home, I am satisfied that a sum of &#163;2.5 million (inclusive of costs) in today&#8217;s terms will buy her a family house in good condition and with ample space to accommodate the children albeit outside the immediate area of central Kensington.  By that stage, she will no longer be bound by the needs of the children in terms of schools and transport to and from their out-of-school hours activities. She will be making choices for herself, although I accept that those choices will continue to be influenced by her wish to be able to accommodate the family from time to time.  Whilst that figure is at the top end of the bracket for which Mr Marks and Miss Cowton contend, it will give her some additional flexibility which I am satisfied she should have.  Whilst these figures represent the current cost of buying in central London, I appreciate that I am looking some six years into the future and, in the light of very recent events, that future is looking unpredictable just now in terms of speculation about future property values.  Nevertheless, the central London property market has always been considered to be a good financial investment, even in times of market volatility.  She already has an anchor to that market in terms of the capital investment she has made in her two rental apartments (currently together worth some &#163;1.28 million).  Whether she chooses to retain those investments or make a more substantial investment in a larger property by way of substitution will be a matter for her.  At present, and allowing for the cost of ground rent and repairs she is receiving a rental income of c. &#163;24,200 per annum<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="13">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> 137A CR produces a gross rental income of &#163;26,004 per annum (&#163;12,700 per annum net of tax).  In respect of Flat 43 at 152GR the figures are &#163;25,740 per annum (&#163;11,492 net per annum). </p>
	      </authorialNote>.  I accept that she has no real prospects of any future employment income.  I do not say that because she has no capacity to work but rather because her obligations to the children and her language difficulties would limit her employment opportunities.  It may well be in years to come that she would wish to find an interest outside the home and, if pursuit of that interest produced some income, so much the better.  But I do not take account of any future earned income as being available to make any significant inroads into her needs going forward.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I can see no justification for transferring to her a property worth some &#163;4.75 million in the context of these Part III proceedings and in the context of a claim which the applicant now advances in the framework of a needs claim of &#163;9.3 million.  That is not a step which could or, in my judgment, would have been taken by an English court in 2009.  I accept entirely that I am not bound to confine myself to a consideration of what would have happened in 2009 had these been English divorce proceedings.  No doubt Mr Todd and Mr Yates would say that if her lump sum claims had been adjourned in 2009 in the context of English proceedings, they would be entitled to resurrect those claims now on her behalf in the context of the different financial circumstances in which the respondent finds himself.   Indeed, in terms, that is the position in which I now find myself in terms of adjudicating this claim.  However, I have reached a clear conclusion that such an outcome in this particular case would not represent a fair outcome. On the basis of the respondent&#8217;s current offer to continue to make the Kensington house available as a family home for the next six years without cost to the applicant, I am not prepared to extract the property from the ownership of the Trust even if the BMT Trust constitutes a nuptial settlement and the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 24(1)</ref>(c) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref> are engaged in this case, and I have significant reservations in terms of the nature of the rights which are, or may be, impressed with such a trust.  First and foremost, the provenance of the wealth in this case is an important factor.  So, too, are the applicant&#8217;s contributions to the welfare of the family and I accept that these have been an important and valuable contribution from her side.  Nevertheless, the existence of the Russian agreement and the implementation of the terms of the subsequent Russian order, looked at in the context of the significant delay in this case &#8211; delay which was not the responsibility of the respondent who has now had to meet financial claims many years after believing they had been extinguished &#8211; all militate against an award which includes provision for housing which I have found to be in excess of her needs beyond 2022.</p>

She may decide to consolidate her investment in the central London property market; she may not.  It seems to me that the most straightforward (and the fairest) way to approach this exercise is to assume that, for these purposes, the two investment apartments represent liquid capital rather than an ongoing income stream. Because I foresee the need for a complete overhaul of decisions relating to her future, and regardless of the current position in relation to the assured shorthold tenancies which she has granted in respect of the two flats, I am proposing to treat them as capital assets for present purposes.  Every former wife who is awarded a <span style="font-style:italic">Duxbury </span>fund at the conclusion of divorce proceedings has a choice to make as to how that capital is to be invested.  The underlying assumptions of the <span style="font-style:italic">Duxbury </span>calculation are undisturbed and the court will not seek to be prescriptive in relation to any future investment strategy which such a wife chooses to deploy.</p>

However, in considering the extent to which the respondent should be required to meet this shortfall, I cannot ignore the fact that for the six years during which she will continue to live at the Kensington house, the sum of &#163;2.5 million which I have earmarked as her future housing fund will be income-producing in one way or another.

Whilst I recognise and have every sympathy with the applicant&#8217;s wish to ensure that her precious children are afforded the same prospects and benefits as the respondent&#8217;s youngest children, I have to bear in mind that their son, at least, is receiving advice and treatment from the specialists at the Royal Brompton Hospital in central London.

I am including within that award provision not only for the cost of that part of the domestic food and grocery bill which relates to their needs but also a sum in relation to the cost of their holidays when they travel with their mother.  That sum will be index-linked and payable monthly in advance by banker&#8217;s standing order.  I am satisfied that it is an order which the respondent can afford to pay notwithstanding his other financial responsibilities to extended junior (and other) members of the wider Z family.  In addition, there will be appropriate recitals in the order that the respondent will meet the cost of any medical treatment for the children, as advised by their treating clinicians.  The order will also record his agreement to meet the cost of any additional private tuition on the basis that (a) it is agreed in advance and/or (b) it is considered necessary by the school.  Over and above that provision, it will be for the applicant at her election to pay for any further costs of additional tuition out of the child support she receives for the children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, since I have made my award on the basis of a needs-based claim, I am hoping that there will be no further issues or applications in relation to the significant legal costs which have been incurred in these proceedings.  I canvassed this issue with Mr Marks during the course of his closing submissions.  In the event that I have to make further decisions in relation to costs, I shall, of course, do so but I would encourage each of these parties now to draw a line under these proceedings which have already occupied too much of their and the court&#8217;s time.</p>
