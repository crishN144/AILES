Whether one would characterise what the husband is doing as being acts of good faith or whether one would characterise it as being the product of coercion imposed on him by the court at the suit of the wife, is debateable.  At all events, the steps that have been taken by the wife have resulted in two-thirds of the first instalment being paid to her by this time.</span></p>

That he is in contempt I am sure beyond a reasonable doubt.  That the committal application was in fact served on him by virtue of the period of time it took for the court to process the paperwork, a few days after it had been intended, does not, to my mind, afford him any kind of technical defence for punishment for that contempt.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Mr. Bentham strongly argues that the court should make an immediate committal order.  I recall the exegesis of Lord Justice Rix in a recent case in which he explains how a committal order has two elements, namely coercion and punishment, and the two elements have to be carefully balanced.  It is for this reason that, whilst there is no principle that the court should normally not move straight to direct committal but should halt at the stop marked "suspended order", there is certainly a practice to that effect.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In my judgment, notwithstanding the defiant contempt of the respondent, it would be disproportionate for me now to imprison the husband for six months, as is sought by the wife, and notwithstanding the eloquent plea in aggravation made by Mr. Bentham on her behalf.  In my judgment, the appropriate order is for me to mark the court's displeasure at the scale of the husband's contempt by sentencing him to imprisonment for six months.  However, the warrant for his arrest and incarceration will be stayed provided that he pays &#163;500,000 by 4p.m. on 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> December and provided that also by that date he complies fully with para.3 of my order of 13</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October.  The fact that he may by then have fully complied with the order may mean that his answers to the first two parts, why he has not complied and his process for compliance, would be extremely short and would say no more than, "I have complied".  But nonetheless he should still comply with my order that requires a disclosure of his financial circumstances, particularly where my order of 26</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February provides for the next instalment, namely &#163;1.7million, to be paid by 4p.m. on 26</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February 2015.</span></p>
