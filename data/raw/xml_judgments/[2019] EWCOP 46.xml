Specifically, first, I am asked to consider his capacity to make decisions around his care for himself; and, secondly, if I find that he lacks capacity, I am asked to consider and, if appropriate, approve a palliative care plan to allow him to die, (which is likely to be in the next few days), with the minimum of pain and stress. </p>

He is twenty years old.  RR is very poorly indeed.  He has severe aplastic anaemia, a condition from which he has suffered for approximately five years and from which he will not recover.  He is said to have a matter of days, or possibly weeks, to live. </p>

I do not have the luxury of time, I understand, to reflect on what I have heard or read.  RR and his family and those charged with the task of caring for him need to have a decision today.

Since then, RR has suffered serious neutropenic sepsis and other life-threatening infection.  When the matter was brought before me earlier this week, RR had not long been discharged from the intensive care unit.  The relevant NHS Trust brought the application, seeking a declaration that it would be unlawful to give RR a second bone marrow transplant or, put another way, that it would be lawful not to give him this further transplant.   </p>

The Official Solicitor was invited, and graciously accepted the invitation, to represent RR in these proceedings.  Over the course of the last four days, further evidence has been collated.  Sadly, during the course of the last few days, RR&#8217;s condition has deteriorated.   </p>

His early years were characterised by significant harm while in the care of his birth family.  His mother and sister are said still to have had (and continue to have) mental health issues.  He was taken into foster care where it is said that he was sexually and physically assaulted by his foster carers.  He was treated as a young person for ADHD and attachment disorder.  Through his middle and later childhood, RR has displayed behaviours consistent with a complex mix of emotional and psychological conditions, variously described in the documents as autism, </p>

A major contributing factor in their decision was the expectation that RR himself would be unable to adhere strictly to the required lengthy and complex care plan.  Therefore, as I say, it was, in those circumstances, that the NHS Trust issued its application for declaratory relief under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref></span> in relation to RR&#8217;s treatment.   </p>

The <span style="font-style:italic">2005 Act</span> of course can only be properly invoked or applied if the court finds that the subject of the application lacks capacity to make the relevant decision.  I do not consider it appropriate, or indeed necessary, for me to set out the statute law extensively as it is contained in the <span style="font-style:italic">2005 Act</span>.  I proceed, as I should, on the basis that a person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that he lacks capacity.  Put another way, that subsection implicitly requires the NHS Trust here to demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, that RR lacks capacity.  A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an &#8220;unwise&#8221; decision is another significant principle in the opening section of the <span style="font-style:italic">Act</span>. </p>

It is fair to say that it is only in recent days, or possibly weeks, that a question (or significant question) has arisen over his capacity, and that question has arisen as his life hangs ever more delicately in the balance.  Because the issue has only arisen in recent days or weeks, I am conscious that I need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that those who are looking after RR professionally have not come to a conclusion about his incapacity out of expediency or because they have, for instance, applied the wrong criteria, or because they have been overwhelmed by the palpable tragedy which surrounds RR and his situation.   </p>

The issue has been addressed by clinical nursing staff both in the hospital and in the community.  Mr McKendrick has helpfully and rightly drawn my attention to the progression of assessments over recent months, drawing specific attention during the course of the cross-examination of Professor Sensky to a discussion with RR as recently as 24 July, which might, suggested Mr McKendrick, have demonstrated that RR was then likely to have been capacitous.  The assertion was made because the conversation, says Mr McKendrick, between RR and the relevant nurse showed RR to possess and display a degree of insight and understanding of his condition and its impact on those around him </p>

Emotional dysregulation is not a feature of Asperger&#8217;s, but Asperger&#8217;s is likely to make communication and emotional regulation more difficult. For example, the rigidity of thinking found in people with Asperger&#8217;s is likely to make it harder for a person to develop more adaptive responses to stress (Dr Dunkerley&#8217;s example of RR&#8217;s response to his injured elbow might fit with this, for example). The observation that [RR] does not wish to talk about the past is also consistent with this. </span></p>

This is very likely to have been caused by the abuse and other traumatic experiences he had in childhood. However, a search of the published literature failed to identify a clear association between attachment disorder and emotional dysregulation. Attachment disorder, if it continues into adulthood, usually involves pervasive maladaptive behaviours. From the information available to me, it appears that [RR]&#8217;s maladaptive behaviours are not longstanding and pervasive, but situational. For example, his behaviour when his aplastic anaemia was first diagnosed, or even before the first transplant, was evidently quite different to his behaviour more recently, because he did not previously have such distressing emotions to try to cope with. Therefore I do not think that attachment disorder contributes substantially to the current clinical picture. </span></p>

However, other features of adjustment disorder are absent, such as persistent sleep or appetite disturbance (I could find no references to these in the medical records).

My preferred formulation, based on the information available to me, is of major problems of emotional dysregulation due to childhood trauma, compounded by Asperger&#8217;s syndrome (see above).

[RR]&#8217;s poor ability to manage distressing emotions and his pattern of using maladaptive coping strategies is likely to result in his being unable to reflect on aspects of his treatment which cause particular distress. Rather than thinking about such aspects or talking with someone about them, [RR] will do whatever he can to avoid them. As a consequence, it is very unlikely that he can base any decisions on all the relevant information available to him. [RR]&#8217;s evident reluctance to talk (and presumably also think) about the past also contributes to this, in that future decisions are commonly based, to some extent at least, on past experience. In addition to their effect on using information, the thinking mechanisms just described will affect his ability to convey his decisions to others and more particularly to consider other options where necessary. For the same reason, the mechanisms just described are likely to interfere with his ability to conduct proceedings. If he is striving not to become overly distressed, it can be predicted that he will try at least sometimes not to pay attention to distressing information he is being given. This is likely to interfere with his registering such information. </span></p>

[RR]&#8217;s autistic traits could be modified with long-term therapy and coaching, but there is no likelihood that they would respond to a brief intervention, even if [RR] was amenable to such an intervention. Emotional dysregulation also requires long-term therapy. As [RR] noted in his interview with me, particular types of interaction can exacerbate [RR]&#8217;s distress and therefore make it more likely that he will employ his usual maladaptive coping strategies. There are evidently some people who are better able to engage with him than others. However, in my opinion, even if it were possible to engage [RR] optimally, the problems described above would persist. In other words, in my opinion, optimising the interaction of staff with [RR] would still leave him with impaired decision-making about his treatment. </span></p>

All they had done was to help him, RR, to create distance from distressing emotions but were not helpful to him in decision making as they were essentially avoidant.

There is no real prospect of a second bone marrow transplant.  Even were it not for this recent deterioration in his health, there are identified in the documents real concerns over whether this would have been in his best interest for a number of reasons: </p>

It is fair to say that until recently RR wanted a transplant but his discussion with Professor Sensky now casts doubt on that.  He said, &#8220;They can&#8217;t do anything for me.  I&#8217;m not mentally strong enough.&#8221;  Professor Sensky asked whether there was anything that could be done to make him stronger.  He said, &#8220;No.&#8221;  He told Professor Sensky, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do another two months in hospital.  I can&#8217;t do it, dad.&#8221; </p>

On his behalf, the Official Solicitor makes this submission:  </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.47in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;Whilst all life is precious, ultimately [RR]&#8217;s remaining likely limited further period of life should be as comfortable as possible, to permit him to enjoy his remaining time with his family, his father in particular, his girlfriend and other half-siblings and friends.  After careful consideration, the prospect of around a one per cent success rate in respect of a second graft appears insufficiently compelling given it would subject [RR] to arduous treatment in a confined hospital setting which he clearly has struggled with and which could also mean he is unable to see family and friends, given the need for him to be nursed in isolation.  Further, such a decision is more consistent with his more recently expressed wish not to have the treatment and his feeling of importance by being with those he loves.  The magnetic factors point to allowing him as quality a time with his family and friends as possible.&#8221; </p>
