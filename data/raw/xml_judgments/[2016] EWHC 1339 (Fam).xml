	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Within this context, at the outset of the hearing the mother relied on three defences to summary return, namely, that the father has acquiesced to the children remaining in this jurisdiction, the objections of the children, and harm.  Very sensibly, in light of the evidence before the court and a report from the CAFCASS High Court team as to the children's wishes and feelings, the mother does not now pursue the objection defence or the harm defence.  Rather, she rests her case squarely on acquiescence.  For reasons I shall come to, I am not satisfied that that defence is made out.</p>

The mother was born in May 1970, and is now aged 45.  Both are British nationals.  The parties married in January 2003.  SR was born in December 2007 and MR was born in September 2010.</p>

This was an agreed move and followed a difficult period during which the mother had suffered from a serious illness and from difficulties with her mental health.  It is apparent that following the family move to Canada matters did not go smoothly.  In light of the mother's concession that she is not able to make out the defence of harm under Art 13(b) of the 1980 Convention, it is not necessary for me to descend into detail with respect to the problems that emerged within the marriage following the family's arrival in Canada.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 22 September 2015 the mother issued a without notice application in the Family Court for a child arrangements order.  The application form completed by the mother's solicitors repays close reading.  The Form C100 that a party is required to complete when applying for a child arrangements order contains at Section 6 a series of questions designed to alert the court to the fact that the case may have an international element.  </p>

The answer given failed, however, to make clear that the children, who had moved to Canada at the same time as the mother and father, were also likely to be habitually resident in Canada.  </p>

This was plainly incorrect.  The jurisdiction of the court to make a child arrangements order derives from Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (hereafter Brussels IIA) pursuant to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2(1)</ref>(a).  Under Art 8 of Brussels IIA the English court only has substantive jurisdiction where the child is habitually resident in England and Wales.  In circumstances where the application form indicated at Section 3(b) that the children had moved to Canada 14 months previously and had only been back in this jurisdiction for 10 days, it was self-evident that there was, "<span style="font-style:italic">Reason to believe that there may be an issue as to jurisdiction in this case</span>".  In the circumstances, I am at a loss to understand why the solicitor for the mother replied, "<span style="font-style:italic">No</span>" to this question.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In the circumstances, the Form C100 issued by the mother was materially deficient in that it failed to make clear to the Court Office that this was a case that plainly had an international element and raised issues of jurisdiction.  It also gave the district judge, before whom the matter first came without notice to the father, less assistance than should have been the case within the context of a no doubt busy list of other short matters.  I have not had the opportunity to investigate in detail why the solicitor acting for the mother failed to complete the Form C100 accurately.  However, on the face of it, the matters I have set out above constitute a highly regrettable omission on the part of that solicitor.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Within the Form C100 the mother made certain allegations that the father had been controlling of her and psychologically abusive.  The mother further alleged that the father owned guns and had taken the children to the rifle range to practice shooting.  The mother, however, made clear that the father had never been violent towards her or the children.  Within this context the mother is described in the Form C100 as "<span style="font-style:italic">Seeking the comfort of a residence order</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>).  The basis of the mother's without notice application for a child arrangements order is summarised in the Form C100 as follows:</p>

I have real concerns that he will take them away to Canada, where they have no family support, and he cannot look after them properly, as he works full-time.  They should remain with me.  I also have concerns that he may commence proceedings in Canada.  In the short term I am, therefore, seeking an order for the girls to live with me, to mitigate the risk, which would give me time to take the appropriate steps".</p>

That issue must be addressed at the outset of the proceedings and good practice requires that in every case the court sets out explicitly, both in its judgment and in its order, the basis upon which it has either accepted or rejected jurisdiction under Brussels IIA (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re F (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/789" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 789" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 789</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re E (Brussels II Revised: Vienna Convention: Reporting Restrictions)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 2 FLR 361" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 2 FLR 361</ref>).

The basis for the district judge's decision that the English court had jurisdiction appears to have been that: (a) the children were within the jurisdiction of England and Wales; (b) the children had by that time been enrolled in school in England and Wales; (c) it was the intention of the mother to remain in England and Wales; (d) the father was aware the children were living in England and Wales with their mother; (e) the father had not yet commenced proceedings in England and Wales; and (f) the mother was not aware of any proceedings having been commenced in Canada.</p>

The letter of 3 November 2015 indicates that the contact proposals being advanced by the mother were not agreed by the father, who put forward counter proposals.
