A little over a year ago she suffered a catastrophic stroke which has left her very severely physically disabled, brain damaged, and significantly incapacitated.  Although PL is receiving good quality nursing care round the clock in a residential home, she is being kept alive only through the provision of Clinically Assisted Nutrition and Hydration (&#8216;CANH&#8217;) through a Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (&#8216;PEG&#8217;) tube.  </p>

Indeed, the function of artificial feeding in the case of Anthony, by means of a nasogastric tube, is to provide a form of life support analogous to that provided by a ventilator which artificially breathes air in and out of the lungs of a patient incapable of breathing normally, thereby enabling oxygen to reach the bloodstream&#8221;.</p>

Specifically, he seeks a declaration that it is not in PL&#8217;s best interests that CANH should be continued, with the inevitable and foreseeable consequence that PL will shortly thereafter die.  PL&#8217;s family are united behind the application.   </p>

There was no single independent expert advising the court on diagnosis, prognosis or best interests (although Dr McCluskie had not been involved in the treatment or care of PL and so his status is akin to an independent doctor to whom the CCG made a referral), but I am satisfied that I have acquired all the relevant information from the witnesses from whom I have received reports and/or heard orally.</p>

Two children were born to the marriage, though sadly their adult daughter died in 2010.  She worked in various administrative roles, but took early retirement when she was in her late-50s, and has since engaged in much voluntary and charitable activity.  She had been a volunteer leader for the Brownies and Girl Guides for many years and until shortly before her stroke had helped to run a mother and toddler group at her local church.  Significantly, she had been a lay assessor for the Care Quality Commission, assessing nursing homes.</p>

Latterly she had played table tennis, to which she had achieved county championship standard.  She had a passion for crafts, sewing, and baking, and she greatly enjoyed foreign travel, visiting many corners of the globe with her husband.  In July 2016, she travelled to Switzerland and Italy on holiday with her sister.  I believe that on this trip they walked on Gornergrat in Zermatt; they sent postcards to the family joking that they had climbed the Matterhorn.  She is a committed Christian with a strong Christian faith; she believes in life after death, and I received evidence, which I accept, that she does not fear death.  She has a firm belief that she will be re-united with her daughter after death.  She had a good social life, though many of her circle of friends have now sadly passed away.  She is devoted to her grandsons whom she has visited regularly.</p>

At St. George&#8217;s, a mechanical thrombectomy was performed, without success; she was placed in an induced coma for two weeks.  Brain imaging revealed a large left hemisphere infarct<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

On 3 September, she was moved to Kingston Hospital.  At the point of her transfer, the consultant neurologist from St. George&#8217;s (Dr. H) reflected that &#8220;her prognosis was likely to be very poor based on the severity of her brain damage, reduced conscious level and age &#8230; PL had extremely poor rehabilitation potential&#8221;.</p>

Dr. U, the treating Consultant Stroke Physician, states that he himself explained the procedure of PEG insertion, including the benefits and complications, to ML though I am advised that there is nothing in the medical records which sheds further light or explains the circumstances in which that occurred.  It is said that ML gave his consent to the insertion of the PEG, but he does not recall being given any or any significant explanation of the implications of CANH; he has a significant hearing impairment which may have some relevance to his lack of clarity on this issue.  The absence of clear evidence about the circumstances in which the PEG was fitted is unfortunate, particularly given that it is accepted that when the naso-gastric tube had been fitted at St. George&#8217;s some weeks earlier the family had indicated that PL would not have wanted this. </p>

She has no speech, and is unable to communicate verbally, although she appears to be able to follow some simple sentences at times; she sometimes squeezes her son&#8217;s hand when he places it in hers.  The lay and professional consensus is that she is unable to process anything but the simplest statement or question, and generally only if the question is accompanied by actions, prompts or context.  Miss C, speech and language therapist, describes how she is generally unable to choose an object from a choice of two shown to her: &#8220;she does not show the ability to make the choice or initiate any movement with her eyes or hand/arm&#8221;.  She may nod when she wants to affirm, but it is felt that she is less likely to shake her head when she wishes to convey a negative response; she often does not respond to questions at all.  She spends much time asleep.  She is sometimes uncooperative, for instance in relation to dental care, by clamping her mouth shut &#8211; which, as SL observed, is her only way of exercising any control over her current situation. During the last month, she has been noticeably less responsive according to ML and SL, who told me, separately, that they felt that she had become less communicative, and more &#8220;vacant&#8221;.  ML felt that the &#8220;situation seems to be getting worse not better&#8221;.

Indeed, whilst these terms are undoubtedly useful to describe the conditions of certain patients for treatment, management, care or other purposes, inevitably each patient is different; some patients will have characteristics of one condition and characteristics of another, but not classically all features within the one definition.  There is, in any event within each definition, potentially a wide range of variables &#8211; i.e. there are, plainly, many degrees of consciousness (from those who are only just above vegetative to those who are bordering on full consciousness) within the broad category of &#8216;minimally conscious state&#8217;, a point which Baker J made (at &#167;46) in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Adult Patient)(Minimally Conscious State: Withdrawal of Treatment) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 1 WLR 1653" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 1 WLR 1653</ref> (&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Re M&#8217;</span>).

Indeed, I have seen a useful chart which shows that to a set of 10 questions posed over the course of 8 weeks, she gave widely inconsistent responses with no discernible pattern.

Quite apart from anything else, as is well-recognised, the diagnosis is often difficult, and may indeed change over time.   So just as it would not necessarily follow that someone who is in a &#8216;vegetative state&#8217; would be bound to have life-sustaining treatment discontinued, the fact that someone retains consciousness and can answer questions is not in itself a reason not to consider discontinuance of life-sustaining treatment: see <span style="font-style:italic">An NHS Trust v A</span> [2006] 2 Lloyds Rep Med 29.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The pessimistic view of PL&#8217;s prospects of rehabilitation expressed a year ago by the Consultant neurologist at St. George&#8217;s (Dr. H) has proved, sadly, to be all too accurate.  It is the clear view of Dr. McCluskie, formed following assessment conducted in the last few weeks, that there is indeed nothing more that can be done to assist or promote her rehabilitation; there is only a negligible chance that she may improve in her ability to communicate.   It is possible but &#8220;unlikely&#8221; that she will be able to express herself in a more consistent way.   Miss C (SALT) is of broadly the same view; she told me (coincident again with the view of Dr. H) that the point by which most recovery would take place has in fact passed, and any further improvement is now likely to be &#8220;minimal&#8221;.  Miss C felt that there was no benefit to PL in further speech and language therapy.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given my description (above) of PL&#8217;s current state, it is not at all surprising that there is a consensus among professionals and family that PL lacks capacity to litigate, and to make the crucial decision about life-sustaining treatment which is at the heart of this case.  Her stroke has, in my judgment, undoubtedly caused her a significant &#8220;impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2(1)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref></span>). PL has a significantly reduced ability now to interpret vocal input, aswell as having difficulty in expressive output.  There is, in Dr. McCluskie&#8217;s view, evidence of further brain damage which would contribute to her cognitive defects &#8220;including memory, concentration, speed of processing and executive functioning.&#8221;  He adds: &#8220;it is for this reason that I do not anticipate that she will ever have capacity make a decision about whether she continues to receive parenteral nutrition and hydration&#8221;.  </p>

In terms of her decision-making in the future, it is felt that the best that can be hoped for (which is assessed as being remote) is that she may be able to make simple choices about what to wear, or whether to visit the garden.  That limited comprehension and articulation falls far short of what would be required to understand, retain, or use or weigh complex information about the continuance of CANH, and communicate her decision accordingly (<span style="font-style:italic">section 3</span> ibid.).</p>

I was invited to consider evidence that while in hospital, PL tried to remove a drip from her arm.  Later, after her arrival at her nursing home, her PEG tube was found to have been removed in circumstances which could not be readily ascertained; it was put down to possible nursing error, but it is suggested that PL had tried to remove it, particularly given that on a subsequent occasion she was actually witnessed trying to undo the clamps on the tube.  I cannot confidently conclude that these events represent clear evidence of a current wish to effect the withdrawal of her treatment; nor can I draw confident conclusions from the evidence of SL that on one occasion he found his mother staring at the &#8216;nil by mouth&#8217; sign in her room and then looking at him as if to give him an indication that she wished to have her treatment withdrawn or discontinued.

I weigh in the balance that a life which continues to depend on CANH is likely to involve at least minor complications for PL (i.e. further hospital admission for replacement PEG under sedation, bed sores, risk of aspiration, skin infections) and is likely to end by PL suffering a further stroke, developing pneumonia or a fulminating illness; she is very &#8216;frail&#8217; as it is.  The palliative care plan to follow the discontinuance of CANH has, in my judgment, been carefully thought through, and appears to me to afford PL the dignity for which she would crave, and a passing which involves the minimum of distress.   If life-sustaining treatment is to be withdrawn, I am satisfied, having heard Professor Turner-Stokes&#8217; evidence, that both nutrition and hydration should be discontinued. </p>

The Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Aintree</span> emphasised that while the court can, indeed should, accept that the preferences of the person concerned are an important component in deciding where her best interests lie, it is still a "best interests" test; see &#167;24 of <span style="font-style:italic">Aintree</span>.  As indicated above, Charles J in <span style="font-style:italic">Briggs</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">No.2 </span>attached particular, even decisive, importance to the views of P, making the powerful point that someone with capacity could, through advance decision, displace the ordinary expectation of treatment in order to preserve life.

It should be published in a form which protects the anonymity of PL and her family for at least three months after her death; I will give SL permission to extend that anonymity order, on notice to the press, no less than two weeks before the order is due to expire.  In any event, I propose to direct that its publication &#8211; and indeed any reporting of the outcome of the case &#8211; should be deferred until 21 days following PL&#8217;s death.</p>
