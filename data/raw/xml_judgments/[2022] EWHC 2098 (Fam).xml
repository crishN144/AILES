	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment is given following a hearing that started yesterday afternoon and concluded last night.  It was to deal with an application made yesterday morning by the parents of Archie Battersbee, now age 12 years. Archie has been the subject of proceeding issued by the NHS Trust following Archie&#8217;s admission to hospital following a global hypoxic brain injury. He has been in deep coma since, cared for in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (&#8216;PICU&#8217;) at the Royal London Hospital since early April 2022. I am very grateful to all counsel who attended court and provided documents and information at very short notice. The parents attended remotely from the hospital and Ms C, Archie&#8217;s brother&#8217;s girlfriend was in court. The hearing was conducted in private at the request of the parents. The media were permitted to attend.</p>

She gave evidence before the Court. Her view as to Archie&#8217;s condition and prognosis accords exactly with that of Dr Playfor. Her evidence, however, casts some light on the reality of Archie&#8217;s day to day experience. She has told me that with brain injury as devastating as that sustained by Archie, the loss of brain function, inevitably, causes adverse cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, metabolic and haematological change. This in turn creates instability in organ function and in the heart. In her statement, Dr F lists the treatments that seek to manage or mitigate this instability. They require to be set out here because they reveal the reality that every aspect of Archie&#8217;s bodily function is maintained artificially through ventilatory support, chemical assistance and the physical care provided by the nurses. This is a remarkable medical achievement but the moral and ethical challenges it creates are obvious. Archie&#8217;s care requires the following: </span></p>

She described what she regarded as the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;not insignificant&#8217; </span>risks of moving Archie to a hospice as being first the physiological risks that are inherent with regard to Archie&#8217;s condition, such as the risk of a drop in blood pressure when he is turned and moved. This is a particular risk in the moves from bed to trolley and movement in and out of the ambulance. Second, human or accidental error that may dislodge tubes with medication that is there to support him in the context of a small transport team that would not be familiar with his care. Third, higher risk of equipment failure (battery run) and inherent risks of being in an ambulance on the road. Fourthly, the logistical risks regarding transfer of someone in Archie&#8217;s condition, including delay and the need for the ambulance retrieval service to liaise with the palliative care team at X hospital, co-ordinate with the hospice as to bed availability, have conversation with the family to ensure understanding intensive care will not be continued and treatment would be withdrawn within a very short time after arrival, usually about an hour. There would also need to be an additional ambulance team involving specialist staff and an additional ambulance to be available. Only once that is in place would the hospital finally liaise with the hospice and confirm bed availability. Although accepting it was difficult to judge she was informed this is likely to take a minimum of 48 hours. This is subject to a number of variables such as availability of staff, ambulance, and other demands on the service.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the evidence of the mother about what she has observed as a possible change in Archie&#8217;s clinical condition Dr F&#8217;s evidence was clear that this was not related to Archie breathing, this had not been observed by any staff. Dr F described the sensitivity of the breathing equipment, how it responds to things like condensation or small movement, for example during physiotherapy movements that can result in a change of pressure onto abdomen or stomach that moves air into the chest. These incidents cause the ventilator to display this change, for example by a white line. She described the steps taken by the clinical team on 26 July 2022 having been told of the changes the mother reported, those actions did not support any evidence of independent breathing by Archie. The white lines alone do not represent Archie breathing, there is a need to look at the patient and see if there is any chest movement. That has not been observed and when the steps are taken (such as to remove water condensation) the white line disappears. The PICU chart recordings have remained constant. When asked about the more recent changes noted by the mother Dr F was not aware of them or them having being brought to the attention of the treating team and considered they were more likely to have been caused by the factors she had outlined and the sensitivity of the machine. As regards the level of the alarm settings the mother refers to in her recent statement, Dr F said the important alarm setting is for apnoea in the context of the high level of nursing care the other alarm settings are not used. </p>

No objection was taken to this course and she had given evidence at a previous court hearing. She is engaged to Archie&#8217;s oldest brother and described herself as the family advocate. In her clear and powerful evidence she described the visit with the family to the hospice last Friday and described what they could offer if Archie went there. She emphasised that the family understood the risks, Archie had been moved around the hospital and they recognise that there is a risk Archie could die. She described how the circumstances at the hospital meant the family considered if treatment was withdrawn there Archie would not die with peace and dignity due the breakdown in trust and other circumstances at the hospital. By contrast, she said the hospice would be more peaceful due to its circumstances and setting, the facilities it can offer to accommodate the family and their willingness for Archie to stay there after his death for longer than at the hospital and they have on site bereavement counsellors.</p>

The expert had only been approached very recently, his email says yesterday afternoon, the timescales in Dr R&#8217;s email are likely to be much longer due to the need to consider all Archie&#8217;s notes as his position is so unusual. No criticism is made of Dr R but he does not have recent clinical practice in this area and any statistics he sets out should be treated with very great caution. For example, reliance on the emergency retrieval service statistics from 4 years ago is over simplistic due to the nature of the service to move critically ill children, which is different to Archie and the severity of his needs as described by Hayden J. In addition, no breakdown is given of the children&#8217;s particular needs within the data. </p>

Whilst recognising the benefits of the hospice garden as described by Ms C the context is likely to be that treatment will be withdrawn very soon after arrival, usually within the hour. Also, to be weighed in the balance is the loss of the Chaplain service at the hospital if there was a transfer to the hospice. Finally, to go in the balance are the facilities at the hospital, the evidence of the good relationship of the family with some of the nursing team and the offer from the hospital medical director to provide what support they can to the family. </p>

As Hayden J set out at [47] <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230;Arrangements can be made, with which I need not burden this judgment, that afford Archie the opportunity, for him to die in peaceful circumstances and in the embrace of the family he loved&#8217;.</span> In this hearing the parents have made very clear they would wish that to take place at the hospice due to the facilities that are there, the support that is available both before and after Archie&#8217;s death and their concerns expressed about this being undertaken in the hospital. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr F&#8217;s evidence was clear and detailed about the risks of transfer. She is someone who knows Archie very well and had a detailed understanding of his medical position. Her careful analysis, which I accept, in her most recent statement and her oral evidence of the risks and where they come from in the four areas she identified was careful and balanced, underpinned by clear reasoning based on her experience and a detailed understanding of Archie&#8217;s medical condition. She distinguished this transfer from other movements in the hospital and had undertaken detailed enquiries of what a transfer to the hospice would involve to help inform her view, as described in paragraph 7 of her most recent statement. In her statement she describes the risks in transfer for Archie as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;major and unpredictable&#8217;.</span> I agree. In addition, it is necessary to factor in the further delay that would be caused, although the helpful very recent clarification from the hospice that the times could run concurrently needs to be taken into account.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Her evidence needs to be viewed in the context of her update about Archie&#8217;s medical position, which is becoming more fragile. For example, I accept her evidence about the increased reliance on the vasopressin infusion and the consequences for Archie and the recent incident with the disturbance of the line to his neck, the loss of blood pressure and the need to relocate that line. These are but two examples of Archie&#8217;s difficult and increasingly compromised position.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Archie&#8217;s best interests must remain at the core of any conclusions reached by this court. When considering the wishes of the family, why those wishes are held, the facilities at the hospice, what Archie is likely to have wanted as outlined by Hayden J in [47], the risks involved in a transfer as outlined by Dr F and the increasing fragility of his medical condition I am satisfied that when looking at the balancing exercise again his best interests remain as set out on 15 July 2022, that he should remain at the hospital when treatment is withdrawn. The circumstances outlined by Dr F of the physical arrangements at the hospital and the arrangements that can be made will ensure that Archie&#8217;s best interest will remain the focus of the final arrangements to enable him peacefully and privately to die in the embrace of the family he loved. The parents in the email from their solicitors on 2 August 2022 confirmed, in principle, their willingness to co-operate in these arrangements. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the issue of palliative oxygen. I am satisfied that issue should be left to the clinical team on the ground. Sadly, the evidence points to it being unlikely he will breathe once treatment is withdrawn due his severely compromised medical position and the extent of his injuries.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As regards any change in his clinical position. The mother&#8217;s evidence as outlined in her statements is that there have been changes noted on the display in the ventilator indicating a white line or other sign that she considers indicate an ability by Archie to breath independently. When the issue was raised with the clinical team in July the physiotherapy team undertook a procedure to see if that was demonstrated but no change was noted. Dr F&#8217;s evidence was clear and I accept it that such changes in the display are invariably caused by other factors, such as moisture caused by saturation, when removed, the white lines goes. Also, movement of the body, such as the leg, can generate a similar sign. Dr F said what needs to be looked for is movement in the chest, which has not been observed. Dr F also provided a rational explanation for the non-reliance on the alarm that the mother considered was relevant. It is wholly understandable in the very difficult circumstances this mother is in to constantly be vigilant for anything that could signal a change. On the evidence I am satisfied that it not the case, if anything Archie&#8217;s position is becoming more compromised.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning, finally, to the issue of treatment abroad. This has been raised in a letter from the parents MP asking the hospital to consider this. There is no detail as to what is being actually being sought and where. Whilst accepting it is a balancing exercise Dr F&#8217;s evidence set out her concerns about the risks in any air travel for Archie The Trust have provided Dr I&#8217;s helpful statement with an analysis of what is known and reached a clear conclusion on the information she has seen that such experimental treatment would be inappropriate to consider without a full neurological assessment including brainstem testing. I agree.</p>

Their unconditional love and dedication to Archie is a golden thread that runs through this case. I hope now Archie can be afforded the opportunity for him to die in peaceful circumstances, with the family who meant so much to him as he clearly does to them.  </p>
