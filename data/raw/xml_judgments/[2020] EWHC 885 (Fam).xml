	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.08in">On 22 October 2019 I gave a judgment which I hoped would end this extremely longrunning matter (&#8220;my October 2019 judgment&#8221;)<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span/><a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2019/2765.html">https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2019/2765.html</a><a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2019/2765.html" style="text-decoration-line:none;color:#000000"/></p>
	      </authorialNote>. That was a forlorn hope. The orders reflecting my costs decision have never been made. Substantial costs have been incurred since then. Investigations have revealed that the factual footings on which I gave judgment were faulty. I have had to conduct another hearing, by Zoom on 8 April 2020, to try to get to the bottom of matters. As a result, in this judgment I must revise the disposition made in my October 2019 judgment. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.08in">The reason for this is that on 22 October 2019 I was misled by the husband about the true scale of his unencumbered liquid funds over which the freezing order would range. I granted a freezing order in the sum of &#163;100,000 &#8211; see paragraph 23 of my October 2019 judgment. I did not specify over which assets the freezing order should range but I intended that it would be directed first and foremost to the funds held by Aegon.  This was based on a representation and assurance given to me by Mr Meachem, the solicitoradvocate representing the husband. The assurance was that the pension funds held in both Curtis Banks Limited and Aegon/Hargreaves Lansdown were worth in excess of &#163;350,000 and that the orders therefore needed only to be directed to Aegon, or its replacement Hargreaves Lansdown, and to Curtis Banks Ltd. It was implicit in the assurance that there were substantial funds in both places. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.08in">This may have been literally true, but it was not the whole truth. Subsequent investigations have revealed that while there were funds in Aegon/Hargreaves Lansdown worth about &#163;370,000, these were not in any sense easily realisable. Only &#163;25,369 could be easily extracted. The special nature of the product meant that the balance could not be accessed unless it was transferred to a flexible drawdown product offered by another provider. This would require the consent and cooperation of the husband, which, plainly, would not be given. The funds in Curtis Banks would have been easily accessible but these had fallen to a mere &#163;93. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.08in">It is therefore clear that I was misled about the scale and liquidity of the funds held by both Aegon/Hargreaves Lansdown and Curtis Banks. Had I known the truth I would have made a freezing order in a materially larger amount to allow for the inevitable costs in achieving access to the remaining funds held in Aegon/Hargreaves Lansdown. </p>

There then began an investigation by both the wife and the receiver to try to establish the true facts. In the course of that investigation substantial sums of costs have been incurred. Since 17 October 2019 the wife has incurred costs of &#163;43,529. The husband has incurred costs of &#163;9,737. The receiver has incurred costs of &#163;27,944 (but had &#163;1,443 on client account) and estimates that a further sum of &#163;25,620 will be incurred in implementing the costs orders against the Aegon funds on the basis, which must be anticipated, that the husband refuses to cooperate in their transfer to a flexible drawdown product. </p>

The hearing took place on Wednesday 8 April 2020. As explained above, Mr Meachem supplied a &#8220;witness statement&#8221; 37 minutes before the hearing was due to commence. That witness statement did not challenge the costs claimed by the wife and the receiver. The costs schedules, respectively dated 6 and 8 April 2020, were in the e-Bundle used for the hearing at pages A24 - A33. Mr Meacham did not challenge the costs claimed during his submissions. At the conclusion of the hearing I allowed Mr Swift to file a supplemental note clarifying an ambiguity in relation to the costs claimed. Mr Meachem was permitted to file a response. Mr Swift&#8217;s note was sent at 10:19 the following day. Nothing was received from Mr Meachem. The draft judgment was sent to Mr Swift and Mr Meacham, as well as to the receiver, at 10:20 on 13 April 2020. It sought typographical corrections (only) by 10:00 on Wednesday 15 April. Mr Meachem&#8217;s email challenging the costs claimed was not sent until 16:39 on 14 April 2020. His email did not address any typographical corrections. </p>
