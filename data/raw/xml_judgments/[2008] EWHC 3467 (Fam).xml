They have been in a serious relationship since December 2006.  They do not live together full time.  That needs to be qualified: the mother is in housing association accommodation and in receipt of benefit, which would be lost if she cohabited on a full time basis with the father.  He for his part lives in one bedroom accommodation shared with other young people.  He has the sole use of his bedroom, the shared use of a bathroom and lavatory upstairs and  kitchen.  But, the evidence is that they spend four/five nights a week and weekends together, usually at her place but sometimes at his.</span></p>

She was accompanied by her own mother VK and her sister Amanda.  The party was seen by Dr Y, the paediatric registrar, the presenting complaint was facial bruises.  It was noted that there were bruises to both upper eyelids, though that to the right  was worse, bruises to the right left scalp and the side of the left face.  There was a conjunctival haemorrhage and there was bruising across the nasal bridge beneath both eyes, bilateral (that is both sides).</span></p>

The explanation he received from the mother at admission was that she had dropped the brother off the night before to father and had collected him at about half past seven in the evening the following day.  She had received an explanation from her partner, DL, that the baby had fallen off the bed while he was out of the room going to the lavatory.  On his return to the room, he found FL lodged between the bed and the bedside cabinet in his bedsit, a gap measured when he reconstructed the layout of the room to the police very shortly afterwards at something like 20 centimetres.</span></p>

Dr D, the consultant paediatrician, arrived and met the mother at about half past four in the afternoon.  The CT scan returned a normal scan with no evidence of intra-cranial haemorrhage, but mild generalised brain swelling later confirmed by a subsequent MRI scan.  The skeletal survey revealed that both clavicles (collar bones) were fractured.  The X-rays were sent on to Dr R of Great Ormond Street Hospital.  She reported that on her reading of the X-rays the clavicular fractures were recent, within four to seven days, but she also picked up rib fractures on both sides, numbers 5, 6 and 7 on  the left and 4, 5 and 6 on the right, with a periosteal reaction (the beginning of new bone formation) suggesting they were older than 7 to 10 days, putting them outside the likely time frame of the clavicle injury.</span></p>

Provision was also usefully made for JD of Resolutions, who has a strong reputation and experience in working with parents where there are difficult questions of parental interaction and capacity to be answered, to give a preliminary assessment moving, if the threshold were found to be crossed, to a full risk assessment.  So that work usefully has already been commenced. I was told he has had at least one meeting with  the parents.</span></p>

Paragraph 9 sets out 7 injuries, but numbers 5 to 6 have now been deleted thereby implicitly accepting the mother's response to threshold that these relate to a persistent discolouration on the arm and leg, still visible, and there since or very shortly after birth.  There remain extensive bruising to the left cheek, extending to the left side of the forehead and skull, significant bruising beneath both eyes, the conjunctival haemorrhage and the two sets of fractures to which I have referred (the clavicle fracture and the rib fractures).</span></p>

In regard to the rib fractures, they seek a finding that these were sustained in a different time window, not less than eleven or perhaps not more than twenty-five days before 7th January, that is in a different but overlapping I think by one daytime frame, again caused by, they say, significant excessive  squeezing or compressing forces applied to the chest.  It is said by the Local Authority that to inflict either/or both of those sets of injuries requires force out with beyond outside rough, clumsy or inexperienced handling an therein constitutes inappropriate parenting within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>.</span></p>

I should add that the mother told me, and I accept, that the effective distance between them is one hour on the bus - for her anyway; she does not drive.  He is an agency driver.  It is also their case, and I accept, that the father would visit many times a week and during those visits played a full hands on role as a father, involved in the changing and feeding and so on.  Additionally, as I have said, she would, much less frequently, go over to his place.  There were specific dates around the Christmas party season when -- and in itself it is no criticism of the mother -- she went out, leaving the father, DL, in  charge.  One was 15th December when, according to her, he was in charge when she popped out to get a pizza and was away for an hour plus.  On 22nd December she went off to a party.  She says she was away for something like 3 hours, was reluctant to go, missed the baby terribly when she was there and came back a bit early.  Father puts the time she was out at 5-6 hours, but it has a greater significance in that it is identified by both of them as the first extended period on which he was in sole charge.</span></p>

The Local Authority, therefore, inevitably seek findings against both as possible perpetrators and they are plainly within the band of reasonably possible perpetrators if I find non-accidental injury and, again, in accordance with established practice in the alternative, failure to protect,  itself capable of constituting parenting below the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> standard.</span></p>

Osteogenesis imperfecta (producing weaker bones) allied to what I think would have been known in the past as rickets has been suggested.  Its presence has been decisively negatived by Dr A, an endocrinologist, whose report was so decisive that he was not required to attend.  There was a further detailed enquiry,  properly made of him, which he promptly and helpfully answered which again negatived any further rare explanation.</span></p>

Both parent otherwise reject any non-accidental explanation for all or any of the observed injuries.  However, on the father's limited concession both agree and suggest the proper way forward is for these 4 threshold findings to be made on that concession to utilise the instruction to resolution and proceed to risk assessment.  The Local Authority say it is not a sufficient threshold finding.  Given the nature of the issues in dispute and the importance of them for further work in the family if I find them made out, in my judgment it would have been wrong for me to accept and proceed only on the limited basis and concession father made.</span></p>

The parents say collectively and individually that the likelihood of necessarily rough handling to achieve the removal of the child from the mother's uterus is such that it is sufficient that the Local Authority are impeded from establishing on the balance of probabilities that there was an non-accidental cause.  They say that they believe the effect of the ribs broken during the delivery process persisted and is an explanation for what is said to be FL&#8217;s irritability on being handled and his propensity to cry when picked up until calmed.  It is of course a fact that escaped birth specialists and the parents, but to be noted that Whipps Cross Hospital on 7th January, as Dr Duthie ruefully acknowledged, did not pick up the rib fractures on the X-rays that were taken on admission.</span></p>

As to the other noted injuries which are accepted and which are said as appears to be the case to have occurred on the night the father was on duty, they were the combined accidental consequence of the careless  fall.  In the fall, it is said, it is likely that FL fell and bruised his face, head and eyes against the bedside cabinet, the side of it or the edge of it, the plugs on the floor in a socket collection - not the sockets themselves, but the hard edge of the back of the plug, and even possibly the feeding bottle which the father had placed in his mouth when he went out to the lavatory.  It is suggested that the likely explanation is that the 1st clavicle broke on the fall and the 2nd would have been broken when the father, in panic and stress coming back into the room and seeing the fallen baby, picked him up roughly -- he told the police he did so -- simultaneously by the leg and harm, causing stress fractures which could have broken the other clavicle.</span></p>

She did describe him as clueless with children. I am not entirely sure what she meant by that.  She seemed to derive it from making rather more than I would have done from him rocking FL, she thought too rigorously, in the car seat in which he was placed at the end of contact and putting him behind his legs so that he might accidentally tread on him on another occasion during contact.  I find that a little odd.

He  accepted what is there described and the dating process.  He observed there was no new periosteal growth on either clavicle on 7th January, but some healing observed on the later 31st January, which helped him fix his dating process to not less than eleven days, though Dr R (who was not called) would have gone for a tighter time, a 4-7 day bracket.  Of the ribs he noted some evidence of healing around the fractures.  His preferred dating is 11-25 days.  In his report he said considering the point that was earlier being put of which he was aware that they were not in his view old enough to be birth related.  He properly added that radiological dating is a matter largely of impression, subjective and necessarily imprecise, in short a professional judgment.</span></p>

He did not consider that the forces in  the drop from the bed could cause the rib fractures.  The clavicle which was initially suggested by the mother to be birth related as well could not, he said, be related by the dating evidence to the birth.  As to locating it within the explanation offered by the father, he allowed for the possibility that one clavicle might be broken in the fall, though he thought it was a slight one.

Dr J confirmed that the rib injuries were likely to have caused by the application of force beyond rough handling, even by the inexperienced.  He observed that low level falls do not commonly cause rib injuries &#8211; a general proposition with which Dr L concurred and which I accept, but the doctors did make these observations, answers or concessions in the course of discussion and cross-examination on the part primarily of the parents.  Dr J noted that on his timing there was an overlap of a day or so.  The X-rays were not of the finest quality and it was, therefore, theoretically possible that everything occurred on one day. He conceded that rib fractures can occur at birth or even be caused by coughing.  The compression or manipulation involved in removing a child could cause a rib fracture, which can be missed on X-ray.  I have already observed that they have been.  He conceded, too, that fracture healing is variable. He said the window within which something is likely to happen, the question of healing and how well depends, among other factors, on how well the fracture is immobilised and allowed to heal and access to blood supply.  Dr L also agreed that rib fracture could occur at birth.  He described it as "extraordinarily rare, barely possible, but an explanation&#8221;.  Dr J thought that a single fracture to the clavicle could occur by yanking both arms causing tractional force and thus a fracture to the shoulder.  But he did think that yanking upwards by both arms is a difficult explanation because it would require the application of very severe forces.  It became a little more possible, he allowed, if there was a pulling up not by both arms but by arm and leg, as I have already described father told the police.  In that event though, he would be looking to see and would expect to see the fractional forces or the torsional forces applied producing a fracture elsewhere and along the arm itself. Dr L, as I understood his evidence, was himself rather more doubtful whether yanking by the arm could cause the one clavicle fracture.  He queried it was unlikely and found difficulty in accepting that sufficient force could be applied. </span></p>

It will be recalled that he looked at in the joint meeting and made the observation, medically relevant at least, that looking at any particular element of the set of injuries there might be an explanation, not perhaps the most likely or even the unlikely, but one also had to look at the assembly and the context of all the injuries and had to look at context which can and does include in the medical spectrum issues such as   delay in reporting.</span></p>

She remarked that when she received the first report from the father she did not want him to think he was a bad dad.  She told me the birth was hugely traumatic and she received the impression there was a lot of pulling and shoving and generally pulling the new born about.  It has to be taken into account that although she was not wholly unconscious she was under a sufficient degree of anaesthesia to make the whole procedure bearable.

I accept as a starting point Dr L saying it is a barely possible explanation but the barely possible does of course happen and that of itself does not prove rule it out.  I do bear in mind that his judgment, although he modified it a little, was that if one looked at it objectively as a professional, an obstetrician gynaecologist; this was not a birth experience at the traumatic end of the spectrum.  There is, for example, no note, though that is only a mild indication either way, that forceps were applied to the body or of any examination to exclude rib fracture.  I put that in as a mild indication on which I would not place a great deal of stress, but I note it nonetheless.  The persistent crying presents a little of a puzzle too.  It simply is not picked up in the notes we have by AJ, the midwife, HC, whom I found to be a conscientious student midwife and now a full member of the profession, or JD, the hospital midwife, equally careful.  Nor do they carry a distinctive separate oral recollection.  Of course, these are professional women who see an enormous number of mothers in the course of their professional and daily work.  But it is nonetheless telling that there is no record of mother raising the issue to the extent that they note it, as it seems to me I am entitled to expect they would.  Moreover, when three of them do not that seems a more telling and significant non-account than when one of them does not.  MT suggests that they were too embarrassed, each of them and  cumulatively to admit to professional oversight.  I see what she means, but I would expect, hope and I find that they were professional enough not to run for cover quite in that way.</span></p>

None of them note or told me in evidence that he cried every time he was handled or changed.  He was never taken to the GP for it and the picture that was presented to me was not entirely consistent either.  He was sometimes described as always crying; he  was also described as irritable just when handled.  Then mother said he would sometimes cry until comfortable and sometimes moan.  The father's primary description was that he was "fussy" when he was picked up and would give  what he called a "kind of moan" and then settle.  So I am not getting, it seems to me, a very clear and coherent picture here, in reconstructing what is said to be the discomfort from the broken ribs all the way back to birth.</span></p>

The doctors are rather unsure, Dr D and Dr L, have difficulty in grappling with the ability of FL to wriggle.  Why, one asks, would he fall out of or move from his admittedly slightly precarious, but still prone position lying on his back making a dent by his small body on the softer of the two cushions that we can see in the picture -- the grey one, not the hard red one -- so as to fall over at all.  Even if he fell, the doctors between them can each of them accept one fracture separately explained, but have a problem, as indeed I do, with the double combination.  The fall is a possible cause, says Dr J, of one fracture.  Dr L  noted it at the joint meeting as being very doubtful, pointing out that babies often fall out of beds and very rarely fracture.  Dr J, as I have already noted, and as for the possibility of the yank to the arm and leg but would be looking for the likely presence, though not the inevitable presence of a fracture on the arm too.  Both doctors agree that the clavicle injury would be painful.  Exactly how would vary from case to case. Dr J said without measurement for significant time.</span></p>

Why does the father stay in all day? It is not as if he is in a flat with a great creature comforts; it is a bedsit in, as the picture I have plainly tells me, cramped accommodation.  He had the pram with him; why did they not go out?  He did not walk out, he did not meet anyone.</span></p>

She called him at 11 or 12 o'clock in the morning and he says when she rang he promptly told her what has occurred.  Why had he not done so earlier?  It does seem to me that the alternative explanation I have given is a constructed hypothesis and no more than that, that it does not fit the medical presentation, it does not fit plausibly the account given by the father himself and has the further difficulties that I have already described and so I am bound and I do find that the infliction of the clavicle injury and the bruises is non-accidental, by excessive force and perpetrated by the father.</span></p>

The way that the bruises, for example, come up on and after 5th January tend strongly to support occurrence around that time.  I have already said that I found that the bruises are likely to have been the result of non-accidental inflicted injury.  Taking the story as a whole, I cannot propose such complete confidence in the mother that I  can take the positive step of exonerating her.  But I do find, for the assistance of those working with the parents in the future, that the probability is by a large margin that it was likely to have been the result of actions taken by the father, either when he was alone with FL on the  many occasions when they were staying together and he would have got up to change him or feed him in the middle of the night or otherwise take care of him.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">I deal with the issue of the alternative that I need to consider in regard to each parent.  Plainly, if I am wrong about the actual perpetrator then the father has failed to protect.  Has the mother failed to protect?  So far as the early rib injuries are concerned, in relation to those it seems to me that I am in difficulties  in making a positive finding that she was specifically put on enquiry around 22nd December.  I remain, however, troubled that the distress likely but not inevitably, to be the result of the rib injuries was not picked up by her.  So far as the main charge against her not taking FL to hospital on time or in good time, JW accepted the proposition this could be described as the action of an inexperienced parent.  I reject that, not least because I have heard rather more evidence I think than she has. She was not after all an inexperienced mother; she was a second time mother.  There was also some history of difficulty in the first marriage which might have put her on enquiry.</span></p>

I think there was an element of holding back, hoping, less culpably in her case, that things might go away.  I think that is undoubtedly what lay behind the father's late reporting, hoping it would all go down or not turn out to be serious in the end.  He was wrong.  The mother was wrong not to have taken FL to hospital.</span></p>

There was some damage to the skull and it would not have taken much more for this injury potentially to have been a much more serious incident and it really was essential to get medical attention and to get it earlier than was done.</span></p>

I have already described the pattern of life between the parents; they are a parenting couple, they are a de facto household.  It necessarily follows from the findings I have made that there is absent  public law intervention that 2</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> statutory limb made out of future risk which must apply both to FL and to TF.  The extent of that risk and how it impacts on future parenting is something very much to be explored in further assessment from the highly experienced JD, from the guardian's work and social services and any risk assessment and, indeed, the parents joint and separate reaction to my findings.  I will deal with those matters at 2 o'clock.  And also with the Metropolitan Police issue.  Unless that is, it may be that you come to some agreed solution which I agree with.  And I think the outlines of the future work as foreshadowed in my March order.  Can we deal with those matters at 2 o'clock?</span></p>
