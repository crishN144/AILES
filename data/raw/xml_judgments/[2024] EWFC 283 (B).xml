I have seen details of the conviction and note that the allegation comprised of F pushing M against a wall and breaking her fingernail in so doing. F denied this and I am told he was convicted after trial, and made subject to a Conditional Discharge for 24 months and a Restraining Order prohibiting him from contacting M. F maintained his denial of this matter, but I took judicial note of his conviction and will not go behind it.

It was perhaps even more remarkable, that M has managed to somewhat compartmentalise those other matters and facilitate contact between C and F. That contact currently takes the shape of every second weekend and midweek overnight contact. I commended the parents for their ability to put aside their major differences in an effort to co-parent, and to put C first, even in extremely adverse circumstances.

F is barred from the FMH by way of court orders, and clearly it will need to be sold and divided in due course, but there is said to be real jeopardy that the home may be in danger of repossession as both parties have struggled to pay the mortgage and their respective overheads &#8211; as is not unusual in cases such as this &#8211; referred to in the FRC as a &#8216;needs case&#8217;. </span></p>

Notwithstanding her salary will be lower than in London, such is the markedly lower cost of living, M seeks to persuade the court that she would have enough money to rent a comfortable flat for her and C, and to pay for a bi-lingual international private school in the City, at which C has been offered a place. M also cites the promise of a familial network nearby and monetary help from the family, as reasons that, overall, C would have a significantly higher quality of life if the court approves her relocation. </span></p>

She said she would respect the view of the court, and not do anything to disturb C&#8217;s education or mental wellbeing. Her most likely approach would be to plan for the end of the current school year and to then relocate during the summer in 2025, to minimise disruption and prepare C for the new school year in Poland. In answering questions, I had as to the school year in Poland, M explained that Polish children enjoy a longer summer break, but no October half term, however the rules were more relaxed there such that a parent could take the child out of school with notice and she would not object to contact with F between September and Christmas. She agreed that regular contact and a break of not more than one month or so between seeing each parent was preferable.</span></p>

We go cycling, and I have recently moved into a two-bedroom place so that she has her own room. Since things imploded it has been very hard for us. I have put her into music lessons, I am an artistic and musical person, I studied music at University. We have done gardening together, we have planted fruits together, I have recently taught her to ride a bike in a cycling school over the summer. These moments are really important for C as well as me. Some of the things like in school, she was made school council &#8211; I helped her write a manifesto for that using her points of view.

This is comparable to one parent moving to live elsewhere in the UK, such are the speed and cost of road and rail links, and it is not an unusual or outlandish request in context.

It makes little sense for the parties to obfuscate and lie about their income and assets, but sadly this often does happen in the FRC. The evidence I did have is not helpful to F, it is indicative of someone who cannot afford or is not willing to prioritise payment toward C or C and M&#8217;s joint housing needs. The fact that a seven-year-old has to sleep in the lounge of a one-bedroom flat is unacceptable. I also note the somewhat magnetic point that there is said to be so little equity in the FMH that even if they do reach settlement and avoid diminishing that with a protracted legal battle, the residue will not be enough for either to re-house in the London area and it will likely be expended on rent, and/or that M and C will have to move out of London resulting in a school change too. </span></p>

As to her physical and emotional needs, these are currently met by both parents and there is a risk that a move to Poland would diminish contact with F, however I note that his evidence was that he would &#8220;make this work&#8221; and further that M is willing and flexible to compromise on contact.

I note that M&#8217;s proposal is &#8220;costed&#8221; and researched, and comes with the multiple positives of gainful employment, a good school, and a network of family nearby both in Krakow and in the countryside nearby. I note that there is the promise of financial and emotional as well as practical support from M&#8217;s parents who are about the same age as F and therefore fit and well enough to commute to Krakow or vice versa to meet C&#8217;s needs. Conversely, the opposition to the relocation comes with no guarantees at all in terms of stability of housing. It appears F has only thought about his housing needs and arrangements, and simply takes the view that M ought to be able to solely pay the mortgage and that&#8217;s that. It is a poorly thought through approach, because he fails to take into account that jeopardy to the FMH is jeopardy to C directly in terms of the stability of her living arrangements. Whilst I come to the conclusion that both are loving and doting parents, F could and should be doing more in terms of proactively seeking work in the last ten months, and supporting his daughter, no matter his views on her mother.

I find that because the most pertinent factors are the offer of high-quality education, quality of life and lower cost of living, along with the offer of a close maternal familial network. The offer of gainful employment, the likelihood of lower cost accommodation, financial, emotional and practical support from parents and siblings, the much lower cost of living and the promise of a multilingual school are all compelling features in this case. Set against that, the proposal that I refuse to allow relocation is not properly thought through or evidenced most pressingly in respect of financial and housing provision. Perhaps that would be different if the parties were not embroiled in a dispute within the FRC, I do not know. On the face of the evidence before me I find that whilst the matter is finely balanced, and there will (as the SW put it) be pros and cons on both sides &#8211; the parties are energetic and flexible enough to listen to each other and to &#8220;make it work&#8221; as F put it in evidence. For those reasons I find that the evidence tends toward the child&#8217;s needs being best met by allowing the relocation to Poland.
