	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Court is concerned with the welfare of one child, a girl, CB, who is 16 months old.  She is the only child of the parties &#8211; respectively &#8220;the mother&#8221; and &#8220;the father&#8221;. CB&#8217;s parents are not married, but the father, whose name is registered on her birth certificate, has parental responsibility for her.  The parents live separately, and have done so for several months.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents have each made applications in respect of CB.   The father&#8217;s application, first in time (9 December 2016), is for a child arrangements order to provide for CB to live with him or spend time with him, and for a prohibited steps order preventing the mother from removing CB from the jurisdiction.  The mother has separately applied to the court (17 February 2017) for permission to remove CB from the jurisdiction to reside with her permanently in Portugal.  Both applications are framed under <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref></span> to which <span style="font-style:italic">section 1(1)</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">1(3)</span> (ibid.) apply.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the purposes of determining the applications, I have read with care the statements of the parties, from whom I have also heard oral evidence; I have read additional statements, and heard evidence from, the paternal grandmother, Ms. K (a social worker from Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council (&#8216;MBC&#8217;), the <span style="font-style:italic">section 7</span> reporter), and Mr. M a social worker from the Family Intervention Team of Gateshead MBC.  The social work representatives gave evidence by video-link (by agreement, and order of the court dated 12 June) given their concerns for their own safety in the presence of the father.  The case was originally given a time estimate of one day; this was (as counsel before me readily acknowledged) wholly unrealistic, but with some creative listing, the case has been accommodated into my list while on circuit, and has concluded within three days.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother is 29 years old; she is a Portuguese national.  She has lived in England since 2010, when she arrived to undertake a degree course at the University of Newcastle.  The mother&#8217;s wider family all reside in Portugal.  The father is 35 years old; he is a British national.  The parties met in 2012. Their relationship lasted for approximately 4 years, and they separated in October 2016 when CB was 8 months old.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother asserts that the relationship with the father was, certainly in its later stages, emotionally abusive; she complains that he was controlling and aggressive, and she felt unsafe.  The parents had very different parenting styles, and attitudes to child-rearing which caused tensions between them, and increasingly disagreements.  The final breakdown of the relationship was, in any view, difficult and highly conflictual &#8211; the parents argued regularly and there were occasional physical altercations.   The father admitted to the police (when interviewed in relation to a harassment charge: see [6] below) that he regularly shouted at the mother.  The mother asked the father to leave the home in September 2016, but he declined to do so.  Over the period in which the parents&#8217; relationship was breaking down, the police were contacted by one or other parent on no fewer than nine occasions over a period of 6 months.  In September 2016, the health visitor made a safeguarding referral to Gateshead MBC, concerned about the effect of parental dispute upon CB.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In October 2016, the mother took CB to Portugal for a 2-week break.  Over that time, the father telephoned the mother repeatedly; he admits now that he &#8220;bombarded&#8221; her with calls.  On 12 November, he was arrested and interviewed under caution; he was later charged with, and in March 2017 convicted of, an offence of harassment, for which he received a conditional discharge.  The note of the district judge&#8217;s sentencing remarks before me indicates that the judge was influenced in passing that sentence by the fact that at the time of the offence the father was unwell. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That is a reference to the fact that at or about the time of the relationship breakdown, the father was diagnosed with Graves&#8217; Disease, an autoimmune disease which affects the thyroid; this frequently results in, and is the most common cause of, hyperthyroidism.  Recognised signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism include irritability, sleeping problems, and a fast heartbeat.  The condition was apparently brought under control with prescribed drugs.  The mother accepts that the father did indeed become unwell at the time of their break-up, and accepted that certain aspects of his behaviour changed when his condition developed.  She felt, however, that the disease could not explain the inconsistency of his manner towards herself, and towards others.  In this period, the father repeatedly accused the mother of being mentally unwell; he was sure that she was suffering from post-natal depression, and lacking capacity to make decisions for CB.  The mother denies this and there is no evidence of the same; that said, the mother has suffered, and continues to suffer, from an eating disorder, although the evidence indicates that it was well-contained in the relevant period and indeed to date.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 13 December 2016, the mother travelled to Portugal for Christmas with her family.  On the previous day, the father had obtained a without notice Prohibited Steps Order; there is some dispute about when the mother knew of the order&#8217;s existence, and specifically whether she did so at the time she travelled.  The mother returned to the UK on 14 January 2017.  In the meantime, it is reported that the father had tried unsuccessfully to contact the mother and her family, and in desperation had contacted the police making threats to self-harm as he said he was concerned about the welfare of CB; the police checked on the welfare of CB remotely (by phone) and were able then to re-assure him.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Gateshead MBC had become involved with the family following the health visitor safeguarding referral (see [5] above).  The health visitor&#8217;s concern was that parental conflict was affecting CB; she noted the parents&#8217; markedly different parenting styles.  When this referral was followed by separate police involvement, the Local Authority&#8217;s Family Intervention Team was engaged to support the couple; Mr. M from the Intervention Team was allocated to the task.   Mr. M visited the home on several occasions, and spoke with both parents; he assessed the father to be interchangeably overtly and passively aggressive, and rejecting of advice.  The father perceived Mr. M to favour the mother and her situation, and repeatedly suggested in his evidence before me that Mr. M &#8220;flirted&#8221; with the mother.  It is evident from all that I have read and heard that the father became increasingly irritated, indeed angry, with the involvement of the social worker, specifically perhaps because he believed that Mr. M had wrongly encouraged the mother to leave him.  The father further felt that what was needed was &#8216;child in need&#8217; intervention, given his belief that because of the mother&#8217;s mental ill-health (as he perceived it), CB was at risk.</p>

It is reported that in December 2016, the father threatened to &#8220;go after&#8221; the social worker, Mr. M, and that he &#8220;could not guarantee&#8221; that he would not &#8220;do something&#8221; to him.  The allegation was reported to the police.  The father rejected the social worker&#8217;s advice to consult a solicitor, and appeared irritated (when giving his evidence to me) that this had been repeatedly suggested to him.   </p>

In the meantime, on 18 January 2017, the mother had applied for, and been granted, a non-molestation order; this expires on 18 January 2018.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All effective contact between the father and CB had broken down on 16 October shortly before the mother&#8217;s first trip to Portugal.  When appointed to undertake the <span style="font-style:italic">section 7</span> report, Ms. K indicated that she would not be able to report effectively without seeing the father and child together.  Weekly contact was therefore set up following a court hearing in February 2017, with the agreement (albeit reluctant) of the mother, and altogether five sessions of contact (of up to 2 hours each) thereafter took place.  They were of variable quality.  It was reported that the father was &#8220;overbearing&#8221; and &#8220;loud&#8221; in the first contact, and did not always heed advice of the social worker; on at least one visit he was personally offensive to one of the workers.  Although he was affectionate with CB, the contacts were not in the opinion of the social worker an entirely positive experience for her; CB constantly looked for reassurance from the contact supervisors. </p>

The mother complained that their encounters represented a breach of the non-molestation order made in January.  At a meeting with the social worker on 28 February 2017, the mother made clear her continued and increasingly firmly-held opposition to the father having any further contact with CB.   In the following month, after the contact on 17 March, and against clear social work advice, the mother cancelled all further (agreed) contact.  She explained that the father had been &#8220;using CB&#8221; by having contact with her.  She told me that she thought he was &#8220;doing it to antagonise&#8221; her, and he was breaching the non-molestation order.  Contact has not occurred since that date.   </p>

When the father was told that this was not possible, he accepts that he became angry.  It is alleged that he threatened to &#8220;rip apart&#8221; Ms. K, and &#8220;rip apart all the walls&#8221; of the social services offices.  The father does not accept that he used this language in this way, but states that he had said that &#8220;in court&#8221; the social worker would be &#8220;ripped apart&#8221;.  He is said to have &#8220;screamed&#8221; down the phone (he accepts he shouted).  The father then attended at the social services offices, and is reported to have shouted at members of staff, and become aggressive.  The Team Manager, Mr. B, was brought to see him; the report refers to the father &#8220;leaning over Mr. B and jabbing his finger inches away from his face blaming him for ruining his life and saying he would give him a &#8216;bollocking&#8217;. He initially refused requests to calm down and sit down, saying that his heart and brain might stop working if he stopped moving&#8221;.  His behaviour was described as &#8220;manic&#8221;, &#8220;chaotic&#8221;, &#8220;irate&#8221;, &#8220;very intimidating&#8221;.  He was escorted from the premises.

Her principal report is dated 18 April 2017.  She underlines clearly the point that the mother has &#8220;shown very little regard for CB&#8217;s right to a relationship with her father&#8221;, and posits that the mother and CB had a rather inter-dependent relationship, the mother seeing CB &#8220;as an extension of herself&#8221;.

He displayed from his oral and written evidence a firm and sometimes patronising belief in the merits of his own views and opinions, and is not easily swayed.  He had a critical, disparaging and wholly unjustified attitude towards domestic violence support groups, including Women&#8217;s Aid.  From my assessment of him in the witness box, I accept the reports of him being quickly driven to anger, with little appreciation of the impact of his behaviour on others &#8211; whether that be the mother, the professionals or the court.  Even allowing for witness box nerves, his evidence was characterised by pressure of speech; he delivered his answers at great speed and intensity, and was difficult to interrupt, often veering significantly away from the question posed.  His witness statements &#8211; acknowledged to be prepared without the benefit of legal advice &#8211; were lengthy, and obsessive in tone.  His interview with the police in November 2016 was in the same vein.</p>

I accept that he was or certainly became controlling towards her in the way in which he sought to impose his will, whether it be in relation to parenting, or otherwise; he was, I accept, unpredictable.  It is difficult for me to accept that the father&#8217;s abusive behaviour was always as serious as the mother contends; she accepts that she misled me about the extent of the father&#8217;s behaviour towards her over Christmas 2016 (the report of having &#8220;received countless messages from [the father] all threatening to take me to court, which was a breach of [the father&#8217;s] bail conditions&#8221; was not, she accepted, accurate), and had, I find, a general tendency to exaggerate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall, I accept the accounts of the social work professionals in their descriptions of the father&#8217;s behaviour towards them throughout their period of involvement.  There are consistent accounts from multiple social work witnesses attesting to the father&#8217;s aggression and lack of control.  Ms. K told me that the father was unpredictable, and that he has responded adversely if he hears something he does not want to hear.  I accept that; it accords with my own assessment of him.  I further accept that in May he said to Ms. K that he would &#8220;rip [her] apart&#8221; (as she remembered it, not as he did), and I do not accept the father&#8217;s explanation for the comment about his hope that Mr. M would suffer broken legs given his feelings generally about Mr. M and the context of all the other threats to him (see [12] above).  The incident on 18 May took place largely as described in the addendum <span style="font-style:italic">section 7</span> report, in my judgment, and was &#8211; it is clear &#8211; extremely serious; it showed the father to be unpredictable, extremely aggressive with professionals, and hostile.  His angry outbursts to the social workers first on the phone and then in person were interrupted by a gap in time while he made his way to the office, and cannot therefore be explained by a momentary loss of temper.  Nor can these outbursts be attributable either in part or at all to his hyperthyroid condition, given that the illness was by then ostensibly controlled by medication. </p>

That said, I am satisfied that the father&#8217;s behaviour demonstrates &#8220;a pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">PD12J </span>@ [3]).  This is a case where, in my judgment, the father has engaged in an &#8220;act or pattern of acts designed to make a person subordinate and/or dependent by isolating them from sources of support&#8221; (ibid.); there remains a &#8220;risk&#8221; of violence or abuse in the future to which I consider CB may well be exposed.  I am satisfied that unless checked, this behaviour would be likely to cause CB direct physical, psychological and/or emotional harm and she may also suffer harm indirectly where the violence or abuse impairs the parenting capacity of her mother.   </p>

The mother gave evidence, in support of her case that the grandmother is fit and able to offer help, that she cared for her nephews as babies; only in cross-examination did she reveal that this was approximately 20 years ago.  The father is disparaging of the location of the grandmother&#8217;s home, asserting that it is in a poor quarter of the city associated with drugs problems.</p>

I also note the quality of the relationship which she has, or certainly could have, with her father; in the last supervised contact (17 March) they made regular eye contact, and CB felt sufficiently settled in his company to fall asleep in his arms.  I acknowledge the harm to which CB was potentially exposed by the destructive breakdown of her parents&#8217; relationship, and the risk of harm to her by a resumption of that abuse and/or by the father&#8217;s loss of temper or control in her presence.  I have in mind the &#8216;capabilities&#8217; of the parents &#8211; the mother&#8217;s ability to offer good quality care to CB despite her own trauma; the father&#8217;s enthusiasm, as a &#8220;parent who clearly loves his daughter and wants to develop a relationship with her&#8221;, with a degree of &#8220;insight into how she might experience the situation&#8230;&#8221; (see [26] above).  On the other hand, the inability of the mother to contemplate contact, and the father&#8217;s abusive characteristics, which I have discussed extensively above (see [42]-[44] above).  I bear further in mind the extent to which the capabilities of the mother have been, and may yet further be, eroded by the clear and discernible impact of domestic abuse upon her.   The mother&#8217;s plans to relocate to Portugal would represent of course a significant change in her circumstances, albeit at CB&#8217;s very young age, this would not have an impact on schooling or friends.</p>

I have little impression of the accommodation to which they would move, or the maternal grandmother&#8217;s ability to offer daily practical support to the mother in the care of CB.  I was provided with no information about nurseries or schools, and although the mother deposed to plans privately to educate CB in Portugal, there was no evidence of how this would financially be achieved.  The mother&#8217;s evidence of work prospects was unsupported. I acknowledge that the mother&#8217;s primary motivation in seeking to relocate is to return to her home and family, but that intention is laced with <span class="nquotedlist1text1" style="color:initial">a wish to terminate the father&#8217;s role in her or CB&#8217;s life.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I bear in mind that if the mother is given leave to relocate CB to Portugal, this would be likely to consign CB never to having a relationship with her father.  Although the mother can articulate at a theoretical level the importance of CB knowing her father and having a relationship with him, I did not detect that this is heart-felt; she has resisted social work advice to facilitate contact after 17 March, even when professional supervision has been on offer.  The history in the case leads me to conclude that she would be unlikely to honour any commitment to return to the UK to facilitate contact between CB and the father if she were advised that the father had successfully completed a course of anger management or the like.  Skype contact is no real substitute for direct contact, particularly for a child of this age; I accept the view of Ms. K that &#8220;face-to-face contact is necessary for [CB] and her father to establish and maintain a close parent/child relationship&#8221; (see [27] above). When giving her oral evidence she told me that she felt that there needed to be an <span style="font-style:italic">order</span> for contact.  Thus, when the test of proportionality is applied to the relocation plan (see [35] above), in this context it is in my judgment found wanting.</p>

Although the grandmother told me that she felt warmly towards the mother, the witness statement &#8211; which I find had many hallmarks of preparation by the father &#8211; contained no such sentiment; rather the reverse.  The mother told me, with some justification, that the paternal grandmother &#8220;does not understand the situation.  She does not understand why the social worker said that he needs supervised contact.  I could not trust her to supervise the contact herself.&#8221;   The paternal grandmother would not, in my view, provide objective or safe supervision of the father&#8217;s contact for as long as she could not see her son&#8217;s shortcomings.  That said, in the last six months there have been at least two successful occasions of contact between the grandmother and CB in the presence of the mother, and these contacts should be repeated at similar intervals.</p>

This conclusion draws heavily on the obligations to which I have just referred, but is also influenced by the original recommendation of the <span style="font-style:italic">section 7</span> reporter that the father &#8220;would benefit from further support and guidance around child development and he has stated he would be willing to participate in a parenting course&#8221; (see [26] above).  In my judgment, he would gain from some focused specialist domestic abuse prevention work, and/or from further advice, guidance or counselling on managing his behaviours.  Whether he is emotionally ready and able to access this remains to be seen; however, he needs to be able to offer re-assurance to the mother, the professionals, and the Court that he can participate in his daughter&#8217;s life safely.  While conscious of the general principle that &#8220;any delay in determining&#8221; the important questions of relocation and contact is likely to prejudice the welfare of this child (<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span>), I consider that delay in this case is purposeful, and is a proportionate interference with the rights of the parties. </p>
