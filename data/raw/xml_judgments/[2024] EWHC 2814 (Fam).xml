It is clear from the text that the &#8216;better assessment of the child&#8217;s best interests&#8217; strictly relates to the authority making the request and &#8216;best interests of the child&#8217; relates to the authority of whom the request is made. Here however, it is sensibly common ground between all the parties that to determine whether or not the court accepts the request of Norway I have to determine whether proceedings in Norway or in this jurisdiction are in S&#8217;s best interest which involves, among other things considering whether Norway would allow for a better assessment of S&#8217;s interests.  Given that common ground it is not necessary for me to explore the various authorities which have been provided to me on the relevant test.</span></p>

As the Practice Guide for the application of the Brussels IIa Regulation puts it, the assessment of whether a transfer would be in the best interests of the child &#8216;should be based on the principle of mutual trust and on the assumption that the courts of all Member States are in principle competent to deal with a case&#8217; (p 35, para 3.3.3).

Her single biggest point in her written submissions is that transfer will &#8216;ensure the child&#8217;s placement in the country of her citizenship with her mother and extended family nearby&#8217;.  In her oral submissions she related that M has now entered into an arrangement with the Home Office whereby they will assist her to return to Norway and in return she has given up her asylum claim here, which was the means by which she was staying in this country.  (On the second day a photo of a computer screen confirming this was produced.) M has had to do that, I was told, because she is not entitled to any benefits or any accommodation in this country.  So, she says, M will necessarily be in Norway soon.  That means, I was told, that there needs to be an assessment of M in Norway and M would be unable to continue with direct contact with S unless S was also moved to Norway, and any plan of returning S to M would need to be put into effect in Norway.</span></p>

Such delay is necessarily harmful and will cause significant disruption.  The case is prepared for court in this jurisdiction and can be put before the court soon.  In oral submissions they reacted to the news that M was to move to Norway with some suspicion.  The move was not mentioned in a statement that M had made on the 22 October 2024.  If she does move, they do not consider an &#8216;environmental&#8217; assessment of M in Norway will be required (their case on this being revised during submissions). If the court with conduct of the care proceedings considers it is necessary, then they accept it will have to be carried out by someone in Norway (which they hope will be the Norwegian care authorities if they are prepared to co-operate).  Should that indicate, contrary to the Local Authority&#8217;s expectation, that M can cope with a return of S then they will consider an Article 8 application themselves, asking Norway to assume the jurisdiction.  They also accepted that there would need to be an updating assessment as to what has happened since July including fresh drug and alcohol tests, and a review of material provided by the Norwegian authorities in relation to M&#8217;s own support and needs as a child and young adult.</span></p>

She will have accommodation (which will be with her Guardian in Norway while she makes an application to the authorities in Norway), and so will not be homeless.

Different factors have different weights.  I consider the importance of assessing M as she will be when in Norway is a matter of particular importance.  I say this bearing in mind the concerns which the Local Authority had in relation to her.  She was homeless; she will have a home.  She was involved in crime; she will now have benefits on which to live and will have moved away from the criminal gangs with which she was involved.  Further, the negative impact on her ability to sustain contact with S both in the run up to a long-term decision and thereafter if the court considers that appropriate attached critical weight to this issue.  These two points bring me down in favour of agreeing to the transfer notwithstanding the weight that I attach to the delay point.  If I were to work on the basis that adoption will be the outcome of the care proceedings, then the Local Authority&#8217;s case might prevail given the considerations set out above.  It may be that would be the outcome that the courts in this country would reach, however I do not consider it in S&#8217;s interest to render alternative outcomes effectively unworkable.  That would be the consequence of M being in Norway and S in this country.</span></p>
