	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Court is concerned with SS, an 86-year-old woman currently residing in a care home. This application is brought within the context of proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 21</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>. SS has a diagnosis of dementia, and is objecting to her placement in the Care Home, believing that she still lives with her (long deceased) parents, and needs to return to their home and resume working at the job she held in her youth. She has no recollection of the property she owns, or of the majority of her lifestory. I have been told that SS is a woman who has never married, does not have children and has no history of personal relationships. She lived with her parents for much of her life.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">For a long time, she worked for the Lyons cake factory in Chiswick, as a secretary. At 4pm, every afternoon she grabs her handbag and jacket and prepares to return to her parents&#8217; home, believing that she is still at work. A member of the care staff discovered that at the Lyons factory a siren sounded at 4pm signalling home time. Her carers consider that in her own mind SS is living at some point in the late 1940&#8217;s or early 1950&#8217;s. When SS grabs her handbag and jacket the care staff deal with her gently and sensitively. Almost as soon as she leaves the care home, she becomes overwhelmed by the outside world. This is before she gets to the end of the garden.  </p>

The parties have largely been in agreement throughout proceedings and matters appeared to be heading towards a conclusion in respect of SS&#8217;s standard authorisation, relevant conditions, and her wider best interests in respect of care and residence. After extensive and detailed evidence from the Local Authority, the remaining options being considered for SS&#8217;s care and residence are either to remain in her current placement, or to move to a smaller, more &#8220;homely&#8221; residential placement, the Local Authority expressing a preference for the latter. </p>

Within the first few months of what has become known as the first lockdown, 27 of the residents died from infection with the Coronavirus i.e. almost 28% of the community. I heard from the team leader at the care home, Ms Kelly Fisher and the manager of the care home, Ms Christine Fisher. They gave evidence, with Ms Kelly Fisher taking the lead and her colleague making supplementary observations. I found the two women to be profoundly impressive. Their understanding of SS was insightful, caring and sensitive. Despite the challenging times carers and residents have lived through, their commitment to their work and to the people they care for was striking. People who enjoy their work reveal themselves quickly when they talk about it. It was obvious that they both enjoyed working at the care home.  </p>

Both Ms Fishers had seen death in consequence of this virus at close quarter. They were under no misapprehension about how dangerous and insidious the virus is. They also indicated to me the distressing and frightening nature of its impact. Those awful months in 2020 will stay in the minds of these two women almost certainly forever, at least in some way. I had a sense that the continuing challenges of the present have not yet afforded them any real chance for reflection. I also sensed that they were not yet entirely ready to do so. </p>

I believe restrictive physical intervention will be required in this case to protect the patient and staff from coming to harm. Clinical holding by several staff members should be sufficient for administration in this case.

TB prepared a short statement in which he considered that SS&#8217;S father would have encouraged her to take the vaccine. He, it seems, was an enthusiastic follower of science. Her Mother was a freer and less conventional spirit, she was a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;spiritualist and believed in ghosts&#8221;</span>. SS was deeply attached to both her parents.

By way of illustration, when TB brought SS&#8217;s clothes to the care home, SS initially refused to accept them. TB told her that they had been specifically sent by her parents for her to wear. She accepted this and happily wore the clothes. This strategy, I sense, has been resorted to on occasions of frustration. Looked at in isolation, through the prism of court proceedings, it may seem to be a deception. I think it would be wrong to characterise it in this way but the appropriateness of such an approach must be evaluated in its particular context. It has been suggested that a similar strategy, invoking a fiction of parental approval, might be deployed in encouraging SS to comply with the vaccine. </p>

The notes prior to 2015 reveal SS to be a woman who is responsible and proactive in her treatment. Thus, there is a pattern of routine blood tests every few years; vital signs checked and monitored annually by the GP surgery; she has attended walk-in clinics, out-patients hospital clinics (on six occasions, with various complaints, between 2002 and 2010). It is also notable that she underwent a series of sometimes intrusive investigations between 2004 and 2009 e.g. endoscopy, x-rays and ultrasounds. As the dementia took hold, SS was noted to have presented to her pharmacist seeking to collect her prescribed medications before finishing the previous prescription. It seems likely that this behaviour reflected her deteriorating short-term memory. Reinforcing this is a changing pattern, after 2015, when SS misses appointments, fails to pick up prescriptions etc.  </p>

This large care home makes provision for compulsory lateral flow test to visitors, many of whom will themselves be fully vaccinated. There is a further risk presented by staff members. The team leader in the care home has told me that 77 of the 100 members of staff have been vaccinated. Of the 23 who have not been, a few have declined for recognised medical reasons. The remaining individuals resist the vaccine in principle, some believe that it is, as yet, insufficiently tried and tested. By this, as I understand it, they are contemplating some unidentified adverse reactions which have yet to be exhibited.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Certainly, nobody could sensibly doubt the efficacy of the vaccination programme. The National Health England statistics, almost daily updated in the public domain, tell their own explicit success story. A few weeks ago, Covid-19 was reclassified as &#8216;endemic&#8217; in the UK i.e. no longer &#8216;pandemic&#8217;. The forthcoming months generate cause for optimism but without any guarantees. The need for booster vaccinations and/or vaccinations modified to combat Covid variants remains a likelihood. Thus, the greatest risk, statistically, to SS comes from unvaccinated members of staff circulating in the community away from the care home. Properly recognising this risk Ms Christine Fisher tells me that all staff members are required to have two lateral flow tests per week and one Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test. The extent of the weekly testing reflects the calculation of risk. Having manifestly given the matter very deep consideration, Ms Fisher told me that ultimately, though she would wish all staff to be vaccinated, she considered the decision to have the vaccination to be an exercise of personal choice.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">For all the reasons set out above, there can be no doubt that SS lacks the capacity to take a decision on the question of vaccination. Nobody has sought to argue to the contrary. The issue for the court therefore is one of determining what is in SS&#8217;s best interests. Having regard to the available evidence I consider that there is substantial material from which to conclude that SS if capacitous would most likely have declined the vaccination. Though she attended quite fastidiously to her general medical welfare, she plainly resisted vaccinations. The evaluation of what SS would have wanted is in this case, inevitably imperfect. Capacitous individuals facing a frightening pandemic might very well take a different view of a vaccination which restores them to their liberty than, for example, a decision not to take a flu vaccine.  Ultimately, the forensic tapestry can only be woven from the available thread. However, it must be borne in mind that even though a capacity to weigh and balance the decision in focus has long disappeared, SS has nonetheless consistently and volubly opposed the vaccination. SS&#8217;s reality is undoubtedly delusional, but that does not stop it being her reality. This has to be both recognised and respected. </p>

"[45] Finally, insofar as Sir Alan Ward and Arden LJ were suggesting that the test of the patient's wishes and feelings was an objective one, what the reasonable patient would think, again I respectfully disagree. The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being."</span></p>

In such a &#8216;neuroleptic na&#239;ve&#8217; individual, it would be advisable to use sedative medication such as Lorazepam (0.5 mg &#8211; 1 mg) orally as a single dose approximately one hour before the proposed injection. This is an anxiolytic and sedative medication which is used across NHS trusts in management of anxiety, sleep disorder and also in management of acutely disturbed behaviour. Lorazepam is available as an oral solution. Consideration could be given to covert administration in SS&#8217;s best interests. I would not advice use of an antipsychotic medication such as Haloperidol or Olanzapine (antipsychotic medication).  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I would add to the identified options above, TB&#8217;s suggestion that SS be told that her father (now long dead, though very much alive in her mind) has requested that she take the vaccination, in the hope that this will cause her to comply. This involves feeding into a delusional belief system. Whilst that may occasionally have been necessary in negotiating routine day to day challenges, it risks, in this context, compromising all involved. It requires there to be a collusion to trick SS into complying with a vaccination which, on balance, it seems unlikely she would have wanted whilst capacitous and certainly does not want at this point. It is an artifice of a different magnitude and complexion to those earlier more mundane negotiations. It becomes disrespectful to her, not merely as the woman she once was but to the one she is now. Though undoubtedly a well-intentioned suggestion, it risks compromising her dignity and suborning her autonomy.  It cannot, in my judgement, be in her best interests. I entirely understand TB&#8217;s instinctive view that such means might justify the end, given the protection that the vaccine would afford SS. I hope he does not read my reasoning above as, in any way, intended to be a criticism of him. It most certainly is not. </p>

This case has been allocated to Tier 3 because it presents, for the first time, an opportunity to evaluate strongly and consistently expressed views by P relating to vaccination and the weight they should be given, in the broader landscape of the insidious risk arising from the Covid-19 public health crisis.  </p>

One of the carers noted that those involved in attempting any &#8220;gentle restraint&#8221; had better be &#8220;kung fu experts&#8221;, as she put it. The plan which involves both sedation and restraint contemplated the carers&#8217; involvement. Ms Fisher did not think that was appropriate. She told me that she thought that SS would look to her carers for help. They would not be able to intervene; that would be distressing for both parties. Moreover, in Ms Fisher&#8217;s analysis it would most likely dismantle the tentative trust that had been established over the months and in consequence of sensitive and determined professional effort. I find this reasoning to be measured and persuasive. The Local Authority and the Accredited Legal Representative on SS&#8217;s behalf both submitted that when evaluating welfare in the broader sense, it could not be said to be in SS&#8217;s best interests.
