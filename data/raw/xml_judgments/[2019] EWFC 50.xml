	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This matter concerns a child, RP, now just over 2 years of age. The local authority issued care proceedings in September 2017. Their care plan is for care and placement orders. RP&#8217;s mother, and father, oppose the local authority plans, they support a care order with a plan for placement of RP in Poland with foster carers. The Children&#8217;s Guardian supports the local authority plan.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">RP&#8217;s current foster carer, LR, is also a party to these proceedings, following a direction joining her at the hearing on 1 May 2019. She has recently been approved as an adopter by the local authority and if the local authority plan is approved meetings are scheduled by the end of June to consider whether she should be matched with RP.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">RP has been the subject of legal proceedings for most of her life. These proceedings were commenced when she was 6 months old. The original application included the mother&#8217;s three older children, W, 15 years, K, 13 years and O, 9 years. Although these children are RP&#8217;s half-siblings, they are referred to during this judgment as her siblings. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">There have been two main causes of the delay in this case. First, the abduction of K and O to Poland in November 2017, and the eight-month delay in securing their return here in June 2018. The hearing of the care proceedings before HHJ Rowe Q.C. started in June and resulted in the three older children being placed in foster care in Poland in December 2018, pursuant to care orders and care plans approved by HHJ Rowe Q.C. in October and November 2018.  HHJ Rowe Q.C. had also made a care order in relation to RP in October 2018 approving a plan for her placement in Poland, in a separate foster placement to the older three children. The second cause of delay was the care order in relation to RP which was the subject of a successful appeal by her foster carer, LR, this was determined by the Court of Appeal on 31 January 2019 (<span style="font-style:italic">Re RP (A Child)(Foster Carer&#8217;s Appeal) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2019/525" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCA Civ 525" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCA Civ 525</ref>).</span> The care order was set aside and remitted for a re-hearing. The appeal was allowed on the basis that the fact that LR had put herself forward to care for RP was not properly considered and as a result there was a failure to recognise, analyse or place weight upon RP&#8217;s attachment to LR, her willingness to care for RP or the impact on RP of the loss of a primary attachment relationship. In addition, there had been a failure to consider alternative frameworks, such as a special guardianship order.  The matter was listed for directions before me on 8 February 2019 and the case timetabled for hearing this week. </p>

The father had sexually abused W, and there were inappropriate boundaries for the children, whilst in the care of both, or either parent. The mother failed to recognise the risks of such behaviour, was unable to protect the children from such harm and had consistently failed to co-operate with the local authority. Additionally, HHJ Rowe Q.C. found the parents and the maternal grandmother colluded to abduct K and O to Poland, concealed the whereabouts of RP and that W was beyond parental control. It was against that factual background that the court is considering what order meets the lifelong welfare needs of RP.  </p>

As a result, the importance of a child's attachment to his or her primary care giver is now underpinned by knowledge of the underlying neurobiological processes at work in the developing brain of a baby or toddler. </span></p>

In any event, for reasons to which I have already adverted, it is not necessary to do so in this case as, unfortunately, the judge does not appear to have engaged in any real way with the effect on the children of moving them from the care of their primary, and only, attachment figure or with the value to them of maintaining that relationship.&#8217; </span></p>

The judge's reference to the establishment of 'a family life together' which is entitled to 'proper and full weight' has the ring of an argument based upon rights rather than, more importantly in the context of the children's welfare, their emotional reality.&#8217; </span></p>

In many cases, the relationship arising for consideration will be with the birth family. But there is no reason why this requirement should not extend to other relationships identified by the court as relevant, including a relationship with a foster carer. For the reasons identified by McFarlane LJ, where, as here, a child, particularly a child of this age, has formed a strong bond with a foster carer, it is manifestly in the child&#8217;s interest for the court to consider the likelihood and value of that relationship continuing. I am quite sure that Sir James Munby P was not intending to suggest otherwise in&#8230;Re T&#8230;For my part, the court&#8217;s statutory obligation when considering an application for a placement order is to identify any relevant relationship and consider the likelihood of that relationship continuing and the value to the child of its doing so may extend to a relationship between a child and foster carers who have put themselves forward as prospective adopters.  </span></p>

According to the mother O is in hospital with a high fever, W had been in hospital and a court hearing in relation to an application for a secure accommodation order for W was listed in Poland on 6 June. The mother said this was because W had had difficulty adapting to Poland and had difficulties in making friends. She accepted what was set out in paragraph 13 of her most recent statement about having full time employment was untruthful, as was the contract of employment that was attached to her statement. In answer to questions from Mr Pugh she accepted her wish was to have the care of the children in the future, when asked when she would be in a position to do that she wasn&#8217;t sure but said even if there is a wait RP would have the benefit of being in Poland having contact with her mother and her siblings. </p>

The letter dated 8 May 2019 from the Municipal Social Welfare Centre in Elblag states that the relevant Act provides <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;for a temporary nature of foster care, i.e. the child should be placed in a foster family for a certain period of time to allow for regulation of the child&#8217;s legal situation (termination of parental authority of the child&#8217;s parents) and reporting the child to the adoption process, or until return to the natural family&#8230;&#8217;.</span> The letter confirms that in the event RP&#8217;s parents are deprived of parental authority over the child, the child will be reported to the Adoption Centre in order to find an adoptive family.

The letter from the Ministry of Justice dated 9 May 2019 confirms that RP could stay in foster care until she is 18 years.

The revised plan includes suggesting attempts are made to create a &#8216;talking book&#8217; as both RP and O, in particular, like books and this would make contact and communication more enjoyable and effective.

RP&#8217;s existing relationship with her siblings is more equivocal due to the extended periods when there has been no contact and the unsatisfactory nature of the skype contact, despite the best efforts of the older children to engage RP. It is recognised that the sibling relationship is one that will remain important for RP both in the short and long term and should be maintained in a way that is consistent with RP&#8217;s welfare.

Even taking into account the enormous benefits for her cultural heritage, with the ability to maintain her relationship with her mother and her siblings through direct contact the likelihood is that a move to Poland will cause her considerable emotional and psychological harm due to the inevitable severance of her attachment with LR as her primary caregiver and the inevitable loss of that relationship.

If the court made a placement order it is likely RP&#8217;s relationship with LR will continue. I take into account the evidence, which I accept, that supports LR&#8217;s long standing and continued commitment to contact between RP and her siblings and her parents and the assessment of the social worker and Children&#8217;s Guardian of her willingness to do that in the future. The concerns raised by the note of the previous Guardian in September will need to be explored with LR, but the balance of the evidence supports her continuing commitment to contact and ensuring RP&#8217;s cultural needs in the widest sense of both her parents are met. As the Children&#8217;s Guardian states in her report <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;LR is extremely positive about sibling contact and understands the relevance and importance of it. LR was very open with the children visiting her home when they returned from Poland in June 2018&#8230;she would not be opposed to future contacts taking place within her home in the future if it was felt appropriate and safe to do so&#8217;.</span></p>

Such uncertainty, even with the benefits of being placed in Poland and being in close proximity and having contact with the siblings and the mother, would be contrary to RP&#8217;s welfare in circumstances where she will also have had her attachment with LR severed by the move and the detrimental consequences for RP&#8217;s emotional and psychological health that I have found would flow from that.  </p>

Having heard both parents give oral evidence it is clear their negative feelings about RP&#8217;s continued placement with LR are not far below the surface. Additionally, as has been demonstrated in the evidence, the mother is not someone who has a history of co-operating with professionals.   She has lied on many occasions, most recently in her statement about securing a full-time job with an agreement attached. When faced with different evidence from the Polish authorities she accepted was this was simply untrue and had been concocted by her. Neither parent could provide even the most basic information about where they were staying here, their evidence was vague and evasive. I consider if an SGO was made there is the real risk of repeated applications to the court, which even if managed by the court, would have the effect of undermining the stability of the placement to the detriment of RP&#8217;s welfare needs. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.12in">The court must weigh in the balance the importance of family ties including the right of the child to preserve its identity in accordance with Article 8.1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, they should only be severed in very exceptional circumstances and only when nothing else will do. I accept everything should be done to preserve personal relations and support restoration of family relations but that can&#8217;t take place in a vacuum, without regard to the lifelong welfare needs of the child. Having regard to the lifelong welfare needs of RP any order other than a care and placement order, endorsing the plan for her to be placed with prospective adopters is contrary to her lifelong welfare needs. I agree with the conclusions of the Children&#8217;s Guardian. </p>
