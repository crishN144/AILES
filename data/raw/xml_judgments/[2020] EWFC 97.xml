	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.03in">The original care proceedings, commenced in 2017 when R was six months old, involved R&#8217;s three older half siblings, referred to in this judgment as her siblings. In relation to those three children the final orders resulted in them being placed in foster care in Poland in December 2018, pursuant to care plans and orders made in October and November 2018. At that time, a care order was made in relation to R, with a plan for her to be placed in foster care in Poland. That order was successfully appealed by LR and the matter remitted for hearing, which following a contested hearing resulted in the orders made on 24 May 2019.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.03in">There was no appeal against the threshold findings made in August 2018, as set out in the schedule dated 2 August 2018. In summary, the court found that the parents relationship was toxic and the children had been exposed to domestic abuse between the parents. NP had sexually abused one of R&#8217;s siblings and there were inappropriate boundaries. JW was found not to recognise the risks of such behaviour, was unable to protect the children from future harm and consistently failed to co-operate with the local authority. Additionally, it was found that the parents and the maternal grandmother colluded to abduct two of the older children to Poland, concealed the whereabouts of R and the eldest child was beyond parental control. </p>

This would also mean if JW&#8217;s situation changed consideration could be given to R returning to JW&#8217;s care. NP&#8217;s position was to support JW&#8217;s position and he did not seek to play any role in R&#8217;s life in Poland. </p>

First, the unsuccessful attempts to try and contact NP. Second, the contact made with JW on 24 July 2020. JW reported she believed her circumstances had changed. She returned to Poland in the summer of 2019 and successfully applied for contact with her older children. According to JW when lockdown occurred it was agreed the children would remain in her care. JW said she was going to be assessed and a further hearing was going to take place in September. She said she had a new partner who she had known for some time. The Service Team Manager stressed the need for her to file a statement with the court and she said she would do so by email to the court on 29 July. </p>

At each stage the court has understood the difficulties they have had in joining the proceedings by remote means and taken steps to ensure that can take place. Those steps have included delaying the start of hearings, adjourning hearings and directing translation of relevant documents. At each stage, as in the care proceedings, JW has had the additional support of a representative from the Polish Embassy attending hearings, as well as a court interpreter. Whilst the court and the parties were hopeful of JW being able to secure legal representation, it is clear that a contributing factor to the delays in the determination of any legal aid application have been caused by the difficulties in JW promptly responding to requests for further information from the solicitors, with no sign that position is likely to change.

The document she produced over the short adjournment, together with the other material available to the court, demonstrates JW is aware the court may determine her application today and has decided not to engage. In those circumstances, whilst the court has enormous sympathy for her position, the application cannot continue to be adjourned in a vacuum, with little prospect of any change. In my judgment the proportionate balance of the relevant factors come down in favour of the application being determined. JW has all the material to be able to fairly take part in this hearing, she knows that could happen and has chosen, on an informed basis, not to attend or participate. In the circumstances of this case, there is no benefit to R in delaying this issue any further. NP&#8217;s position is different. He has failed to attend recent hearings, knows of the way to communicate any information to the court and has chosen not to engage any further. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Turning to the application for leave to oppose the legal framework is clear. As regards the change of circumstances the court must factor in not setting the test too high. The question is has there been a change in circumstances <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;of a nature and degree sufficient, in the facts of the particular case, to open the door to the exercise of the judicial discretion to permit the parents to defend the adoption proceedings&#8217;.</span> If what JW reports is correct about the arrangements with the older children and her current partner those are positive steps that JW has taken and do indicate an ability to co-operate with assessments. However, this can&#8217;t be viewed in isolation of the findings made by the court in August, JW&#8217;s continued denial or minimising of those findings, the history of JW&#8217;s lack of co-operation with the local authority and professionals, the difficulties the court and the parties have had within these proceedings in getting JW to consistently engage and the lack of any evidence that JW has engaged with any of the work outlined by Dr Szpak in the care proceedings, or that she sees any real need or understanding to do so. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In my judgment JW has failed to satisfy the first test. Acknowledging it should not be set too high and recognising the steps she has taken in Poland in relation to the older children and her own personal circumstances there remain significant features of this case where there has been no real change. These include JW&#8217;s lack of acknowledgement of the findings made, the risks to the children (including R) and the steps that need to be taken to reduce those risks and her failure to consistently co-operate within these proceedings, despite the support arrangements that were in place. Whilst her care of the older children and her new relationship are positive steps, they alone are not of a nature and degree sufficient to demonstrate a change of circumstances relevant to R on the facts of this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Even if I am wrong about that I am satisfied, in any event, the court should not exercise its discretion to give leave. Whilst the court recognises and understands JW&#8217;s particular emphasis on R&#8217;s background and cultural needs the exercise of this discretion is governed by the lifelong welfare needs of R, in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>, of which that consideration is but one of many factors. The application to oppose the making of an adoption order would, in my judgment, have little prospect of success due to the lack of any real understanding or acceptance by JW of R&#8217;s current position, the background and findings made in the previous judgments in the care proceedings. JW&#8217;s strong feeling about what happened to R has, sadly, not translated into any demonstrated real change in her ability to consistently co-operate </p>

Consequently, there would be a real risk of further significant delay if JW was given leave which would be detrimental to R. During the hearings she attended JW came across as someone who was able to articulate herself very well. This was evident during her discussion with the Children&#8217;s Guardian in September, yet as the Children&#8217;s Guardian observed <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Considering the passion with which [JW] talks about having [R] returned to her care, I would have expected [JW] to be more proactive and allocate time to prepare her statement&#8230;&#8217;.</span> A feature of the history of this case is the mismatch between JW&#8217;s strongly held views and her actions. The failure to remain in regular contact with her solicitor to progress her legal aid application is but one of many examples. The court found in May 2019 that any move from LR&#8217;s care was contrary to her welfare, there is no evidence that position has changed. All the evidence points to R being more settled. Whilst that fact alone cannot determine the outcome it is a welfare reality for R. The court must carefully weigh in the balance R&#8217;s background and cultural needs, which need to be considered through the welfare lens, and not in the absolute terms set out by JW. Part of this evaluation needs to take into account the evidence that LR is someone who has shown an understanding of this as an important part of R&#8217;s welfare needs, including the importance of sibling contact. The court has also weighed in the balance the finality of an adoption order, however further delay in the particular circumstances of this case is contrary to R&#8217;s welfare needs. </p>
