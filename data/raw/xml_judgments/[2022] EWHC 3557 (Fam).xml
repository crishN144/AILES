But this court must decide whether to order the summary return of the children to the United Kingdom. This is against the very strong wishes of them all. </p>

They have no blood relations on their father's side in Spain, nor do they have any relations on their mother's side in Spain. So, in terms of a family network there is not one person locally save for their mother. But the world is hyper-connected. They stay in touch with relatives in England through various IT and social media platforms.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">What happened is that in the summer of 2017, the family travelled to Southern Spain. They have had a property there since 2014 which they used as a holiday home. I emphasise that precisely what then happened is in dispute between the parents, and this court today is not making findings of fact about the detail of what happened in the breakdown of the relationship between the mother and the father. The upshot of it was that the children continued to stay in Spain with their mother. She made a complaint about the father to the Spanish authorities. He was arrested. Nothing ultimately has come of that, but this was the fissure, the division of this family, with Mr PT returning to England, and Ms CW remaining in Spain with the children.</p>

Indeed, Mr PT has spent years since that wrongful retention in 2017, and a very considerable amount of money, fighting through the Spanish courts to get his children back. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">In September 2020 there was a major turning point. The Spanish Court set aside all the previous Spanish orders in the case and decided it was the United Kingdom that had jurisdiction, more accurately England and Wales. At this point, of course, it was now well over a year since the wrongful retention in 2017. So, the most obvious channel for a return, The Hague Convention 1980, was not open to Mr PT due to the Convention limitation period, but there was another route: the inherent jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales. That ancient power, dating back as we shall see as far as legal annals extend, offered Mr PT a potential mechanism. That jurisdiction is inherent because it is not granted by Parliament or, indeed any Statute, but inheres to the Court. In other words, it is an attribute or quality that belongs to the Court, or is attached to it, intrinsically and inseparably. That said, whether the Court does grant Mr PT the relief he seeks, the summary return of his two daughters from Spain to England, this judgment must decide.</p>

	    <intro>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In the present case, the father applied under the inherent jurisdiction because he claims this case is exceptional and has unusual prevailing facts. There is a claim of wrongful retention; it has endured over four years, and indeed three years from the point of his filing the application form. It is now almost four and a half years. Reverting to Lord Wilson's rubric, the application needed to be dealt with urgently because of the alleged and continuing harm to the children. It was complex due to the unusual factual background. It required particular cross-border judicial expertise for the reason of the existence of complex concurrent Spanish criminal and civil proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">To understand why this claim has been brought, and why it has been made in the way it has, one must examine the background facts. The mother and father started a relationship in 2007. They lived in England, and in 2008, having started to live together the child L was born. In 2011, Q was born. The children were wrongfully retained in Spain around 26 September 2017 or, as a previous court found, in the alternative from 31 October 2017. Since then, there have been years of Spanish civil and criminal litigation, plus an application by Mr PT under the 1980 Hague Convention, to secure the return of the children. On 25 September 2020, there was the turning point mentioned - at the High Court of Granada. That Court held that the previous Spanish orders had been made without jurisdiction, and it set them all aside. In late December 2020, before the expiration of the Brexit transition period, Mr PT applied to this Court for the children's return. </p>

In September and November 2021 respectively, the parties filed their statements. On 24 January 2022 the children's guardian represented the children having been joined to the proceedings by a Court order dated 27 August 2021. </p>

The guardian and the solicitor reached the unanimous conclusion that she did not sufficiently understand the proceedings to be competent. They then communicated that to L. </p>

On 27 September 2017, a separation order was granted to Ms CW by a court of first instance at Huesca in Spain. On 1 December 2017, Mr PT's representative requested the separation order be stayed. On 2 January 2018, ICACU UK accepted a 1980 Hague Convention application from Mr PT, first received on 14 December 2017, and forwarded it to the equivalent authority in Spain. On 7 July 2018, the Spanish State Attorney issued a report on &#8220;the non-liability of filing a lawsuit&#8221;, in other words, Mr PT's 1980 Hague Convention application, which then proceeded no further it appears. </p>

However, as the trial proceeded the position simplified further. It was agreed there should be a welfare inquiry with oral evidence from Mr PT, Ms CW and Ms Baker, the CAFCASS officer.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Mr PT submitted that a summary return would not put the children at risk from Mr PT himself, and therefore the domestic abuse allegations did not need to be determined. Ms CW agreed that the allegations did not need determining for the court to be able to decide the question of the summary return order. Ms Baker said that Ms CW had refused to engage in her proposal that she completes a domestic abuse information gathering questionnaire that Ms Baker had emailed to assist her on 8 December 2021. Therefore, Ms Baker, having considered the entirety of the material before her, concluded that she, Ms Baker, could make a recommendation to the Court about summary return without need for a fact finding hearing to determine the disputed allegations of domestic abuse. That was because she did not understand that Ms CW's position was that the children should <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> have a relationship with their father on the basis of any risk that he might pose to them. That was not Ms CW's position &#8211; and that would principally be the purpose of the fact-finding hearing, welfare. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">What was also clarified was that if, in principle, the court ordered summary return that should not occur immediately but after the end of the school year which, in Spain is at the end of June/beginning of July. Also, if it was a return to England and Wales, the children should live exclusively with their mother in the interim until the court made a welfare determination, but the children should have direct contact with their father, including overnight staying contact. There would be no need for supervision. The court should grant a prohibited steps order to prevent Ms CW removing the children from Spain prior to any return to the United Kingdom, and from moving them from the United Kingdom after their return without the written consent of Mr PT, or the order of the court, and the children's passports should be lodged with Mr PT's solicitors because CAFCASS is not able to accommodate that. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Therefore, the only issue that remained contested was the issue of the summary return. On this the stance of the parties is as follows. Mr PT makes the application and he is supported by the children's guardian. Mr PT's case, in a nutshell, is that the children being in Spain is inflicting damage on his relationship with them, and that, in turn, is going to cause damage to the children. That broad analysis is echoed with nuanced differences, that I shall come to, by Ms Baker. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Ms CW strenuously opposes the application. She says the children should stay in Spain; return would be very harmful to them. They have settled in Spain now and are happy there, and do not wish to return. Furthermore, a return would seriously impact their mother, who is their primary caregiver, and that would not be in their best interests. Ms CT put it, I must say with admirable succinctness, in her closing submissions to this court, which she provided &#8211; as did all parties &#8211; in writing. She wrote: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">There are several cardinal principles that govern how the court should invoke that jurisdiction. I will identify those principles very shortly, but let me say something about what inherent jurisdiction is for. The inherent jurisdiction arises from the Crown's innate power and corresponding responsibility to protect its subjects. It is both coercive and protective in nature. This power is exercisable, but not exclusively, by the Court. It is wielded on behalf of the Sovereign. The precise origins of this jurisdiction will, perhaps, always be lost in the historical mists. But <span style="font-weight:bold">Blackstone</span> states that aspects of this wider inherent jurisdiction were &#8220;exercised as early as the annals of our law extend&#8221;. See Sir William Blackstone for <span style="font-weight:bold">Blackstone Commentaries</span> 286. Since, at least, the reign of Charles II, the jurisdiction to protect the interests of children was part of the practice of the Court of Chancery. Then, its successor, the Chancery Division of the High Court, before being transferred to the Family Division in 197 (see Sir James Munby extra-judicially &#8220;Wither the inherent jurisdiction?&#8221; CPPA Lecture, 10 December 2020). In <span style="font-style:italic">re (SA) (a minor) (Wardship: Court's Duty)</span> [1984] WLR 156, Lord Scarman explained the court's inherent duty in respect of children as follows:</p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.94in">&#8220;Its duty is to act in the way best suited in its judgment to serve the true interest and welfare of the ward. In exercising wardship jurisdiction, the court is a true family court. Its paramount concern is  the welfare of the ward. It will therefore sometimes be the duty of the court to look beyond the submissions of the parties in its endeavour to do what it judges to be necessary.&#8221; (pp.158-59).</p>

It is simply this: is summary return in the best welfare interests of the child. But this issue can be further refined with a codicil to the issue that the summary return is because the court in the receiving jurisdiction is best placed to make decisions about the best arrangements for the child's short-term, medium-term and long-term future (<span style="font-style:italic">In the matter of</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">KL</span> in the Supreme Court).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The analysis involves the swift, realistic and unsentimental assessment of the best interests of the child leading in proper cases to the prompt return of the child to his or her own country, but not the sacrifice of the child's welfare to some other principle of law ([27], [41] and [31]). </p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.94in">&#8220;. . . there is always a choice to be made.

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.94in">&#8220;The most one can say, in my view, is that the judge may find it convenient to start from the proposition that it is likely to be better for a child to return to his home country for any disputes about his future to be decided there. A case against his doing so has to be made. But the weight to be given to that proposition will vary enormously from case to case. What may be best for him in the long run may be different from what will be best for him in the short run. It should not be assumed, in this or any other case, that allowing a child to remain here while his future is decided here inevitably means that he will remain here for ever&#8221;.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.94in">&#8220;One important variable, as indicated in <span style="font-style:italic">Re L</span>, is the degree of connection of the child with each country. This is not to apply what has become the technical concept of habitual residence, but to ask in a common sense way with which country the child has the closer connection. What is his 'home' country? Factors such as his nationality, where he has lived for most of his life, his first language, his race or ethnicity, his religion, his culture, and his education so far will all come into this.&#8221;</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.94in">&#8220;Another closely related factor will be the length of time he has spent in each country. Uprooting a child from one environment and bringing him to a completely unfamiliar one, especially if this has been done clandestinely, may well not be in his best interests. A child may be deeply unhappy about being recruited to one side in a parental battle. But if he is already familiar with this country, has been here for some time without objection, it may be less disruptive for him to remain a little while longer while his medium and longer time future is decided than it would be to return&#8221;.</p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.94in">&#8220;Hence our law does not start from any <span style="font-style:italic">a priori</span> assumptions about what is best for any individual child. It looks at the child and weighs a number of factors in the balance, now set out in the well-known 'check-list' in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>; these include his own wishes and feelings, his physical, emotional and educational needs and the relative capacities of the adults around him to meet those needs, the effect of change, his own characteristics and background, including his ethnicity, culture and religion, and any harm he has suffered or risks suffering in the future.

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.94in">&#8220;The effect of the decision upon the child's primary carer must also be relevant, although again not decisive . . .

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.94in">&#8220;These considerations should not stand in the way of a swift and unsentimental decision to return the child to his home country, even if that home country is very different from our own. But they may result in a decision that immediate return would not be appropriate, because the child's interests will be better served by allowing the dispute to be fought and decided here. Our concept of child welfare is quite capable of taking cultural and religious factors into account in deciding how a child should be brought up. It also gives great weight to the child's need for a meaningful relationship with both his parents . . .&#8221;</p>

Having said that, I  have indicated I did not read the unsolicited document provided by Mr PT's brother. Certain of the critical documents I had to re-read. The court received evidence from three witnesses, Ms Baker, Mr PT and Ms CW. I intend to weave Ms Baker's evidence into the rest of the judgment. I pause to observe that she is a very experienced CAFCASS officer and part of the CAFCASS High Court Team. She provided a comprehensive 25 page report of the highest quality, and I found it immensely helpful. It was balanced, insightful and realistic. I judge that, at all times, she had the welfare of these two children at the forefront of her mind. I was able to draw great assistance from Ms Baker and the court is indebted to her for her hard professional work.</p>

He filed a statement dated 12 November 2021 along with a 104 pages of exhibits, these included contact notes, correspondence between the parties and documents from the Spanish proceedings. In his statement he emphasised that he was deeply, deeply concerned about the impact of the children living in Spain. He provided a history of the children when they were in this country and stated that they had friends and were doing well here. Ms CW, he says, has a volatile nature and she was not always consistent in her mood and behaviour. On 8 May 2015, for example, she, in an unprovoked way, attacked him and in doing so injured child L, who was then required to be treated medically. An ambulance came, and the head injury was attended to, but the child suffered following this attack. I emphasise that this court is not making any findings of fact about that incident. </p>

After the separation and Ms CW's wrongful retention of the children in Spain, she made sure, he says, there was no opportunity for the girls to see him. Not only had the children been prevented from communications with their father, they have also been denied communications or contact with their extended family. Now, their only contact has been via internet with their grandfather, who is 86, who has also been fed the false narrative as Mr PT puts it. The girls stated they had no friends in the small rural school in Spain, and were being hit by other students. </p>

She has received an agreed amount of child maintenance since the separation, and Mr PT has paid it despite her denying access to the children. He then documented in detail the very real difficulties he has had having any contact with the children. On 28 July 2021, for example, his solicitor wrote to Ms CW to provide him with a copy of the court order dated a week earlier on 21 July, and explained to her that the order of the court required her to make the children available for fortnightly video contact.

The court reviewed the questions and they were completely appropriate. She wanted the court to ask the questions for her and the court was happy to do that. The court has a duty to level the playing field where there is an unrepresented court user, and I judge Ms CW was highly emotional and not in an adequate state to ask questions. </p>

He was very keen to impress upon the court his commitment to the children. I did not find that in doubt. He has fought relentlessly for years through the courts to establish a relationship with his daughters. I found that he was genuine in wishing to support his children if they were returned to the UK. That gave the court confidence that he would do his utmost to ease transition and he would support Ms CW and the children financially to the extent that he was able during what would be a challenging transitional period. He would also work to re-establish his relationship with his daughters once they were here, if &#8211; I emphasise &#8220;if&#8221; &#8211; the court were to order that. I find that the commitment of Mr PT to his daughters would help reduce emotional challenge of any return to the United Kingdom, but that is only one of many important and competing factors.</p>

However, the court directed that Mr PT switch off his camera so that she could not see him although he could see her. Most importantly, counsel who represented him and counsel who represented the children could see her as she was giving evidence. That was, in my judgment, the right balance to strike in granting participation directions and ensuring also Mr PT's Article 6 rights. Under Practice Direction 3AA, in my judgment, those participation directions would assist the quality of Ms CW's evidence, and the court therefore made the necessary reasonable adjustments.</p>

As Charles J graphically put it, if you are lying about point A, it does not mean you are lying point B or, indeed, about everything. But the approach to her evidence gives this court little confidence that in future she would comply with court orders. It is clear in the past she has breached them and done what she wishes. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">In terms of sharing the CAFCASS report, Ms CW did not tell the truth about what actually happened with the report and the children. As I have indicated in my summation of her evidence, she gave numerous different versions of what happened. Her evidence was shifting as she saw the implications of what she had done. The CAFCASS report includes information that is deeply distressing and disturbing to the children. It evidences Ms CW's deep hostility and condemnatory views of Mr PT. This is something the children should not read. Whether they actually read those specific parts is not recorded. She took the risk and the way in which she handled the report created the possibility that that did happen. I find from this episode that she has a poor grasp of protecting the children from proceedings and adult issues and material. The court has great concern that this approach will continue should the children stay in Spain. But, again, I emphasise that that is not the only issue. She does not accept the court decision that the children were wrongfully retained by her. She has little insight or grasp of the emotional harm that has been caused to the children by the deterioration of their relationship with Mr PT. She showed no insight into the harm that this loss of relationship has produced. Indeed, on several occasions, as I have indicated, she actually said that she did not think it was harmful. When she eventually grudgingly conceded that there was emotional harm, she could not explain what it was except in the most superficial sense, and what she said was confined to surface matters, like not sharing the children's plans and activities. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms CW has no, or little, insight into the central importance of the children having a relationship with Mr PT, and unquestionably the major reason for that is the fact that her relationship with him has been seriously damaged. That total lack of insight was confirmed by her rejection of the guardian's analysis of the long term effects of the harm of the loss of the relationship. Her attitude is perfectly encapsulated by her repeatedly calling Mr PT  the &#8220;biological father&#8221;, and the fact, which I accept from Mr PT, that when they broke up she mocked him, denigrated him by designating him &#8220;purely a sperm donor&#8221;. It is entirely unsurprising that, as the CAFCASS report evidences graphically, her daughters now mirror her views about the irrelevance of their father, and her negative attitudes towards him. She has not shielded her children from her negative views. In her court evidence, she listed the outcomes from proceedings she sought. These are principally financial; not once did she mention resumption or the improvement of the relationship between Mr PT and the children. Eventually, under cross-examination she accepted that she did not understand the emotional harm caused to the children. But even when she did accept it, it was hesitating and unconvincing. The fact is that her belief is that, aside from relatively minor matters and the provision of finances, the loss of the relationship has not been harmful to her &#8220;strong&#8221; daughters. This creates the risk, the very real spectre in this case, that without significant changes, the emotional harm to the children will continue, intensify, and become so entrenched that it will become ineradicable with lifelong damaging consequences to both children. Her evidence about the breach of court orders was deeply unsatisfactory, and that amounted, in my judgment, to another evasion and untruth which is contradicted by the contemporaneous documentary evidence. She implausibly claimed that she did not breach the court order about video contact; she evidently did and she continued to obstruct contact. Indeed, she has only facilitated four video calls since the court order of September.</p>

She met first child Q, the  younger child, on 29 November 2021, and held a &#8220;substantive&#8221;, which means &#8220;substantial&#8221; meeting, with her on 12 January 2022, and that was again via Microsoft.

Due to the outbreak of Omicron, and other reasons due to children's examinations, the visit to the United Kingdom did not happen. The children last saw their father in person in Spain on 11 September 2020. The order dated 21 July 2021 for video contact to take place between them did not come to fruition until 4 December 2021. Ms Baker writes that Ms CW has yet to confirm the reason for this delay. I now deal with the academic levels and progress of the children. What is documented is that at an educational level, which is normal, the girls &#8211; that is both of them &#8211; are at a level which is normal and adequate for their age, despite the language difficulties at the beginning. They have achieved a noticeable improvement. The secondary school to which child L was transferred in September 2021 was asked about her progress. The school provided a verbal summary, stating she is making progress there. Although she is very shy, she is integrating more. She has daily hour-long Spanish lessons to assist language needs. I pause to observe if that is so it does not seem likely that her Spanish is fluent as Ms CW claims.</p>

It was fundamentally important that the court should recognise the emotional harm which these girls had to suffer because of the poisoning of their relationship with him by Ms CW. This is what would otherwise be a classic case of parental alienation, but one that has been stretched out both temporally and geographically in litigation sprawling across two countries. That is illustrated by Ms CW's own position that, as is at D263 in the documents: &#8220;The children neither need nor want their father in their lives.&#8221; This is a case, sadly, where the children call their father by his first name, and see no role for him in their future, and that is deeply damaging to them, and something the court should stop. The mechanism for doing that summary return, and for the court which is properly seised with the jurisdiction for making decisions about these children, because they were habitually resident here before their wrongful retention in Spain, to make the appropriate orders. This court is best placed to do so.</p>

Indeed, she asserts in her closing submissions, without evidence, that the United Kingdom has more holidays than Spain and these short breaks can be enjoyed by the father coming to Spain. The girls have, as she puts it, &#8220;churned out&#8221; brilliant grades every term. They have made many friends and love it. They enjoy riding, skiing, climbing, walking, camping, roller skating and horse riding; they speak Spanish &#8220;fluently&#8221;. She says although a network of relatives is important, does that provide a good enough reason to return to the United Kingdom? The children have not suffered or lost touch with any family members whilst they have been in Spain. The children say they do not want to come back. The children have secure accommodation, and it does not make economic sense to move out of property that is owned to property that is rented. She did a comparison in her evidence of the cost of living on a monthly budget in both Spain and the United Kingdom, and the difference is significant, she says. In the United Kingdom it would be &#163;36,492 annually, in Spain it would be &#163;19,986, and therefore the difference and the saving by staying in Spain every year is &#163;16,505, a very significant amount. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The CAFCASS assessment notes that there was a forensic psychological report dated 26 February 2019, that was three years ago. Ms Baker points out that the children's negative views of Mr PT are essentially the same, and the damage to their relationship has thereby been seemingly cemented. The children's views were mostly devoid of balance, heavily mirroring their mother's characterisations of Mr PT and the fact that, in effect, he was redundant in their lives save for his financial contribution. Ms Baker continued:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.94in;text-indent:-0.02in">&#8220;Parts of the narrative mirrored mother's, particularly in terms of their father's very limited worth in their lives. Without  doubt the children have taken cues from their mother.&#8221;</p>

	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">And, therefore, the conclusion of the CAFCASS assessment is as follows: that Ms CW  has failed to protect the children from her negative feelings about Mr PT. She has failed to enable or support any relationship between the children and him, and she has failed to assist the children to hold a balanced view of their father. It is deeply concerning how uniformly negative the views of the children are about the father. There is no evidence of Ms CW working to provide the children with balance, or to support the children's relationship with Mr PT. Instead, the children are closely mirroring the very views that Ms CW expressed in her evidence to the court. This, I am bound to say, is likely to have a serious impact on the life of each child. As Ms Baker put it: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Therefore, it strikes me that what Ms Baker concludes is part of that institutional collective knowledge, that if the relationship remains on a poor, attenuated and impoverished basis that it currently rests on, this is likely to have serious implications and consequences for these children as they move through the rest of their minority and into adulthood. Thus I find that there has been previous emotional harm caused to child L and child Q by Ms CW's failures to support their relationship with Mr PT, and to give them balance, and to impress upon them the importance of having such a relationship. But, Ms CW was never going to do that because she simply does not believe it, and yet, as Ms Baker put it succinctly: </p>

Child Q went to Spain when she was that much younger, and she is more outgoing, so the impact linguistically on her may be less, but I find that there has been harm caused educationally to child L by being educated in a language that is not her first. There has also been an adverse impact on both children because they are not able to communicate with others outside the home in the way that they would want. This inhibits their ability to express themselves, and thus flourish educationally and to develop their social relationships as they would be able to otherwise if they could speak freely in their first language. Certainly, for child L it has left a feeling at times of being isolated and lonely. I find this to be an identifiable harm caused by the wrongful retention in Spain.</p>

Ms Baker is concerned if they do not return to this jurisdiction  that it is unlikely there is any realistic prospect of the children being able to develop a meaningful relationship with their father, or address negative feelings about him which, to the extent that they are not a true reflection of their true experience of him, need to be addressed. Therefore, the court finds that the impact of the return to the United Kingdom, should it happen, will be one that is manageable for the children. </p>

It is something they would certainly have to adapt to, and is something I am completely confident they could adjust to and then move on from quickly. Certainly, if there was the right messaging and support from both their parents. Further, it would be essential for the educational disruption to be minimised. The return, if it happens, should be after the conclusion of the school year so the children could start in new schools at the beginning of an academic year when there are many new pupils arriving at the school. </p>

This supports the longstanding concerns expressed by Mr PT about alienation. When they live in a different jurisdiction and the opportunities for direct contact are limited,  it would require substantial ongoing commitment from Ms CW to promote the relationship with their father. My inquiries to date do not give cause for optimism that she would be sufficiently willing or able to assist the children in re-evaluating their views of Mr PT. The physical distance between the children and their father is, itself, likely to increase the children's sense that he is redundant and irrelevant to their lives and limit the prospect of them regaining a balanced account of their parents. The children and their mother are isolated in Spain and returning to the UK would increase the available sources of support, primarily from their wider family, especially in the event of an emergency or heightened need. Each children's educational prospects in England may well be comparable to those  afforded to them in Spain. However, L's learning here is likely to be accelerated simply as a consequence of her being able to resume learning in her primary language and she is subsequently likely to have a greater prospect of catching up to her correct academic year group. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Therefore, it strikes me that the role of Ms CW in the harm that has been caused to the children is critical, but I sound a note of caution. Mr PT contends that this harm has been intentionally and deliberately inflicted by Ms CW in an underhand and systematic way. However, I am not persuaded that this has been deliberate, in the sense that it was directed at damaging the relationship between the children and their father. I think it is much more nuanced than that. It is likely that Ms CW has been deeply scarred by the previous relationship with Mr PT. She has found it impossible to conceal her views and attitude as a result of that scarring relationship from these children. She does not consider that Mr PT's absence from their lives has done them harm. She said to the court in terms: &#8220;Forgive me if I don't see any problems in regard to the children not having the applicant around. I don't believe it has done any harm.&#8221; She did not see a loss of the relationship between Mr PT and the children had any real consequence beyond areas which are completely trivial like the girls telling him what they were going to be doing next week, and maybe him being able to assist the girls occasionally with homework. That was the sum of it in her conception. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It transpired during her evidence that at least one of the children, and in all probability both, had read parts of the guardian's confidential report. When Ms CW was asked whether she had shared court papers with anyone aside from Mr PT's brother, her answer  was: &#8220;No, just the children.&#8221;  She then backtracked. At best it amounted to her admitting that her youngest child had had part of the report read to her, or she had read, and the full report was left out on the dining room table so the children could read it. Even on the best of Ms CW's case on this point, the children had that opportunity to read the report. It is also apparent that she shared private and embargoed confidential information in court proceedings with Mr PT's brother without the permission of the court. It was a stark and flagrant breach of the rules of this court. There was much private material about these proceedings and thus the life of these children. Once more I am compelled to observe that I found Ms CW's evidence on these topics deeply unsatisfactory and inconsistent. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I conclude that her conduct was part of the picture of her lack of insight into the wellbeing of the children. That stretched from her wrongfully retaining them in Spain in the first place, to her failure to prevent their relationship with their father degrading, to her not seeing any value in that relationship, to her not complying with court orders or remote video contact, to her not understanding that the showing of a confidential report about such a sensitive issue could be harmful to a developing child. This strongly indicates that Ms CW has insufficient understanding of how to create and enforce age-appropriate boundaries, and strengthens the court's concern that Ms CW's views about Mr PT have been inculcated into the children because Ms CW simply does not believe it is inappropriate to do so. What is particularly troubling is her lack of insight into the harm her daughters have suffered. This has not occurred, of course, in a vacuum. Ms CW had the reports on the Spanish proceedings and, in particular, she had the report of Ms Baker, the children's guardian, which emphasised unmistakably the harm the deteriorated relationship with Mr PT had caused the children. Ms CW either did not accept it or could not find it in herself to accept it as it was contrary to her entrenched self-narrative. I am satisfied that in her oral evidence she demonstrated a lack of acknowledgement of her role in causing the rift between Mr PT and the children, and evidenced a near complete lack of insight into the harm the children have been caused as a result of that lost relationship. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_82">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I find that Ms CW's stance towards foster greater contact between the children and Mr PT to be essentially strategic. It has been motivated by a desire to appear to the court to be reasonable, rather than any true desire for the children to have a better relationship with Mr PT. I reach that conclusion because in evidence Ms CW herself makes it clear that she sees little in value at all in the children's relationship with their father. She has no insight into the harm; she has minimised it or she does not accept it. I also find that, should the children stay in Spain, her relationship between the children and Mr PT will not be repaired. I have no confidence that the sudden change of heart at the door of the court about contact will continue once the spotlight of these proceedings has moved on. My unmistakable conclusion is that Ms CW does not believe that Mr PT's participation in the children's lives is important or valuable.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">There was some suggestion by Mr PT that Ms CW lived with the girls in inadequate accommodation, in a &#8220;cave&#8221;. However, a few further facts cast new light upon this. This is a farmhouse, part of which is built into the hills, that is the &#8220;cave&#8221; part. They are known as &#8220;cave houses&#8221;. The advantage of them is they stay warm in winter and cool in summer. It has six bedrooms. I find nothing adverse to the welfare of the children in their accommodation in Spain. However, Ms CW is living on a very tight budget. She is dependent on the maintenance contributions of Mr PT and his father, who lives in [the north of England]. His father is well into his 80s. Ms CW provided what, I am afraid, was very contradictory and unclear evidence about the income she received to supplement these maintenance payments. She has never worked in Spain. She has received some rental, but the evidence about this is sketchy, and what is clear is that it is no longer happening. She was in what was obviously a very distressing financial situation and there was a dispute over the property. She had to ask Mr PT for a very significant sum of money, &#8364;35,000. He says the children could have become homeless if he had not given it to her. He thus sent her funds. On another occasion, Ms CW accepts in her written submission that she did actually ask him to pay money for clothes for the children. What this illustrates is that far from being financially secure, Ms CW lives a financially precarious life, entirely dependent  on others, and therefore the children too, in terms of their financial security, are highly dependent on Mr PT and his father. Should the children be returned to England, there is no evidence to suggest that their physical needs would not be met, albeit the court must recognise that the cost of living in the United Kingdom is higher than in Spain. It may require a greater maintenance payment from Mr PT. To that end he has said that the matter should be referred to the Child Maintenance Service in the UK. I am bound to observe that his record of paying for the children's maintenance has been impeccable, notwithstanding the fact that he has had his access to them severely limited and, as he puts it, he has &#8220;not missed one payment&#8221;. That is not disputed. He has accommodation in the UK. He intends to get accommodation where he can have the girls over for staying contact in due course. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In terms of education needs, Ms CW raised concerns in her evidence about the impact on the children's education if they had to return to the UK. She asserts that the children have been flourishing educationally in Spain, and states that the school is one where the staff go out of their way to create and make a family atmosphere which is supportive and caring. The fact is that the children are having to speak a language which is not their first language. Indeed, child L started secondary school a year late because she was made to repeat a year in primary school because of her language deficit, and she is still getting daily assistance with her Spanish. Any return to the UK has been agreed to take place following the end of the Spanish academic year, thus the disruption will be reduced, but the question remains  whether they would flourish better educationally in  England or Spain. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear from what the children told Ms Baker that their lack of confidence and fluency in Spanish has, at least to some extent, restricted their ability to express themselves. They express relief if they are able to speak English freely rather than their English being confined to an English language class. This lack of confidence about the language they are habitually speaking is bound to have some impact on their educational attainment. It is hard to conceive how it would not. I accept the submission of the children's guardian that the children's educational needs will ultimately be better met in England, where they will be able to speak constantly in the language in which they are naturally fluent and have full confidence in. </p>

Ms CW told the court that return would be &#8220;highly disruptive&#8221; to the children. When pressed in cross-examination both Mr PT ultimately, and the children's guardian, conceded that return of the children would have a detrimental impact on the children. The guardian said that the change would be &#8220;somewhat challenging&#8221;. This must, in my judgment, undoubtedly be the case. The children have been in Spain, albeit wrongly retained,  for well over four years. They have substantially settled there &#8211; not, I emphasise, without problems as I have detailed in this judgment thus far. But, it strikes me there exist obvious mitigating measures if there were a return. They will be returning to a country they both know and have expressed a wish to visit. They will be returning to the  UK in the care of their mother who is familiar with the UK and did live here. They will be returning to a situation where they will be able to access better family support networks, and if there is a delay in implementing any order until after the school year ends that will mean there is time to plan both educationally and in terms of accommodation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Factor (d): age, sex, background and any characteristics which the court considers relevant. </span>Both children are nationals of the United Kingdom, not Spain. There is some evidence from Mr PT that they have been picked on and hit at school in Spain. There is a reference to their being singled out because of their &#8220;looks&#8221;, which may be a reference to their ethnicity. They are, of course, dual heritage, white Caribbean, and it is understandable how they would stand out, at least to some extent, in rural Spain. There is no evidence that the children have any characteristics that would make them particularly vulnerable to a return to the UK. Equally, the children were born in England and were brought up for the first formative part of their lives here. Although they have been in Spain since 2017, they have lived in England as follows: child L &#8211; approximately nine years; child Q &#8211; approximately six years. It is not surprising then that they are fluent in English and it is their mother tongue, and the tongue of their mother who has limited Spanish, and thus they must regularly speak English at home. Ms CW does not have the facility with the language to help them develop their Spanish &#8211; in reality, it is probably the other way around. The fact is they have grown up most of their lives in England, and that is highly significant. </p>

Relevant historical and future harms are the subject of the findings of fact that the court has made, therefore I merely list them for the sake of completeness. I evaluate them further shortly in the Discussion section that follows. The children have suffered emotional harm from the serious damaged relationship with their father. The children will continue to suffer emotional harm should they remain in Spain and the lack of a meaningful relationship with their father. If the children return to the UK they will suffer distress and disruption from being removed from their home in Spain for the last four years, but it will be manageable and not permanent. </p>

I have found that Ms CW has not been able to meet the children's need to have a meaningful and appropriate relationship with their father. Instead, the children held tremendously negative views about Mr PT and consider him to have no place in their life. If they did not see him again, they are at a place where they believe it would be no real detriment to their life and their future, and that is chilling evidence of just how serious the damage in this case is.</p>

The habitual residence of the children was England before they were wrongly retained by Ms CW in Spain. In the following years they have more or less settled in Spain, however, there have been problems with that process. They see, however, their lives as being in Spain. Nevertheless, they are isolated from the rest of both sides of their family. They have no familial support networks whatsoever in Spain. The children's connection to Spain is, therefore, somewhat artificial and contrived. They are isolated and cut off from the entirety of both sides of their kinship groups, save for social media and remote contact. I judge that such contact is a poor substitute for face-to-face contact and spending meaningful time together with their blood relations. Thus, I do not place as much weight on the degree of settling in Spain as I would if there were solid support systems in Spain; there are not. But I am prepared to accept that the children are more or less happy with their lives in that country. I qualified that because of the language difficulty, and especially those that child L has experienced. They do like Spain and the outdoor life, and this is in contrast to the home in Surrey that father proposes they move to. Surrey, I accept, is not the Sierra Nevada, but it has compensations of its own, not least ready access to London and the West End where the girls would like to go shopping, according to Ms CW. But the fact they have lived in Spain for more than four years is not, and cannot be, the end of the matter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">There are some cracks in the unrelentingly rosy picture that Ms CW paints about Spain. In particular, the ability of the children to speak Spanish is not as good as she suggests. They have made progress, as indicated by their school report, but they are not fluent. They are not able to express themselves as they wish, and that comes from the girls themselves, and that must restrict their ability to join in socially. Child Q makes the point that she does not really, as she put it &#8220;have friends in her school&#8221; and some pupils are very rude about the way that she looks, and also because she is English. The &#8220;looks&#8221; may be a reference to her ethnicity and, as indicated, in rural Spain there are likely to be far fewer children with their particular heritage being white English and Caribbean. If they were to move to London and its immediate surrounds, they are likely to have much richer experience of multi-culturalism. </p>

It strikes me that none of those factors should be underestimated and will affect everyday life for these children.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">I make it plain that I do just that. I have little doubt an order for return is contrary to the expressed views of the children. The strength of their views is clear in Ms Baker's report. I do take their views into account, but these views, I have no hesitation in concluding, have not been formed in a sanitised vacuum. The negative views of  Ms CW towards Mr PT and a return to the United Kingdom cannot, indeed, fail to affect these children, consequently their views mirror their mother's views very closely, and I have made findings of fact about this. They love their mother, and their loyalty towards her is touching and affecting. It is understandably very strong. The three of them, in effect, are a closely bonded unit, but they are on their own without another single relation close to them in Spain. They are wholly dependent upon their mother; their mother is entirely dependent, financially, on Mr PT and his father. Her influence on them is significant and unbroken. It cannot have done anything other than massively influence their thoughts about their father and also any return to England. This is a very important factor. It means that I am bound to place less weight on the views of the children because they have not been formed independently; they bear the stamp and hallmark of Ms CW.</p>

I must make it plain that I do not judge that Ms CW embarked upon a deliberate and malicious campaign of traducing Mr PT in the eyes of his children. What is more likely to have happened is that, as this court sees so often, the conflict in a relationship has left very deep scars that spill over. What was evident when Ms CW gave evidence was that she sees the world through the prism of the pain of those scars, therefore it is not a vituperative attack on Mr PT she is engaged in &#8211; it is not so much &#8220;deliberate&#8221; as was put in Mr PT's closing submissions. She has not, in my judgment, poured vitriol into the ears of the children with calculated deliberation. Instead, it is much more complex and also more serious on another level, because she cannot, in my judgment, help herself. She sees this as the reality of life, and this, with deep regret and in a most damaging way, has become the reality of the world view of these two bright and talented children. </p>

Should the children remain in Spain and separated from their father by distance and the intervening sea, I see no realistic prospect of any of this sorry state of affairs changing for the better. Ms CW fundamentally lacks insight, and she cannot acknowledge the harm the children have suffered. She lacks the tools to prevent its repetition and prolongation, nor has she the desire to do so. Once proceedings move on I have little doubt that her ideations will reassert themselves and then a chain of consequence will continue to shape and misshape the views of these two children harmfully. </p>

But there are also good schools in the United Kingdom, and there is not sufficient information before me in the summary proceedings about whether the schools in Spain are better or worse objectively than those in the United Kingdom, but there is a very significant difference. English is the children's first language &#8211; they are fluent in it, they are comfortable in it whilst their Spanish is developing, they do not have sufficient confidence in Spanish to express themselves as they wish, and that limits the quality of their social interaction and, indeed, must place a limit on their academic aspirations and attainment.

I do not regard this as a very significant factor. The house in Spain can be sold, if necessary, in due course, or it may be possible to rent it out, but I emphasise I have no evidence or analysis about any of this. Those possibilities though undoubtedly remain. The key point is that there will be several months before the return if the court orders it, so appropriate arrangements can be made. This return, if it is ordered is summary, but it is not instantaneous for the reasons of the necessity of careful planning.</p>

There is great respect in this country for the Spanish Courts and the principle of international comity applies. The Spanish Courts have ruled that it is the UK Courts that have jurisdiction. Furthermore, it is, in my judgment, better for the various conflicts between Ms CW and Mr PT about with whom the children should live, or what proportions of time they should spend with each of the parents, the level of contact, its nature, the need for supervision, should all be determined by a court in England and Wales where the children were habitually resident before wrongful removal, and which retains jurisdiction under Article 10 of the Council Regulation previously mentioned. </p>

I aggregate, as accurately as I can, all the factors in favour of remaining in Spain, and I weigh them carefully against the emotional harm I have found to be very likely to continue to be inflicted on these children from the continuing impairment of the relationship with their father. All this is likely to be replicated and reproduced because of the real isolation of the children, and the attitude of Ms  CW, with nothing to normalise Mr PT's relationship with his daughters, and nothing to counterbalance Ms CW's fiercely hostile attitude and views towards Mr PT, whom she deprecates, and relegates to a mere &#8220;biological father&#8221;, &#8220;a sperm donor&#8221;.

It will negatively impact their relationships with others throughout their lives, and it significantly outweighs the factors in favour of staying in Spain. I judge that once proceedings end, the situation is very likely to revert to how it was, and the children's relationship with Mr PT will continue to be  stifled. Ms CW has not facilitated contact adequately between Mr PT and his daughters, even though the court has ordered such contact. That bodes ill for the future. Here, Ms CW's own priorities have overridden a duty to the court and the welfare of her children. She lacks acknowledgement of harm and she lacks insight. She has a deeply entrenched harmful narrative. She lacks the ability to maintain age appropriate boundaries to protect the children, and has, in a completely unjustifiable way shared private court documents with another person, and that was a person who, in her own words, she &#8220;did not trust&#8221;. I have found her evidence unhelpful and unsatisfactory in places, and I have found at times that she has been evasive with the court.

This court has an opportunity to protect them from that harmful future; it should not turn away. It cannot ignore that reality. I judge this court must intervene for the welfare of these two children. Having their father in closer proximity to them in the same country will promote more regular and normalised contact between the girls and Mr PT. This cannot be done between the United Kingdom and the Iberian Peninsula. It is fanciful to imagine it could be, particularly with Ms CW's views. Mr PT must, once more, become a normal and consistent part of these children's life. That is for their benefit now and in their future. I have no doubt about that fundamental point. The fact that I conclude it simply will not happen at an international remove points very strongly to what the court must do to stop that recurring. </p>

All this is brought vividly into relief when one considers that by the end of the hearing Ms CW considered that she had no objections to the children, if returned, having substantial and even overnight staying contact with their father, and yet under her watch the relationship has all but withered and died. To this I add the fact that it would be, on balance, educationally better for the children to go to school in England, where they can speak their first language, and they will also have their families nearer to them.</p>

Indeed, the initial Spanish judgment that the children were habitually resident in Spain has been set aside by the highest Spanish Court. The children will be returning to a country and a culture they have been brought up in, and which is not alien to them at all.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">As part of the CAFCASS welfare inquiry, Ms Baker very imaginatively, but appropriately, invited the children to write a letter to the Judge. I have cited part of their missives. I t is right, as a matter of record, and in the interests of transparency, for the court to document its reply to the children. I hope Ms Baker will be good enough to pass it on to them. In part, it says:</p>

I must tell you that I have taken what you say and what you wish for very, very seriously. You are both intelligent girls with a tremendous future ahead of you.</p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.94in;text-indent:-0.02in">Whilst I have listened very carefully, it would be wrong for a court simply to follow what a child wants if it did not think that it was in the child's best interests. That is the position I reached in each of your cases. I have thought long and hard about what is best. That thinking has left me in no doubt that it is best that you both come back to England and for the English courts to make decisions about who you should live with and what contact you should have with each of your parents. </p>

English comes naturally to you and is your first language; you will be able to speak it all the time. I hope that will help. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.94in;text-indent:-0.02in">But the most important reason I decided you should come back to England is because of your father. What these courts know is that it is usually much, much better for children to have both their parents in their life. I felt that if you stayed in Spain that would prove to be too difficult. Your relationship with your father would not get any better. So one way to look at the return to England, which I know you did not want, is to see it as a fresh start. You will have other members of your family in the UK much nearer to you and I hope you will benefit having them all in the same country.</p>
