She understood why the application had been made, she would like C to experience some of the birth process but recognised the position needed to be kept constantly under review and, depending on C&#8217;s state of mind, could see that a caesarean section may be the only option.  Mr A&#8217;s views were relayed to the court through the applicant&#8217;s solicitor, he wanted to ensure that whatever steps are taken, both C and the unborn baby are safe and helped C recover. </span></p>

In her written and oral evidence CO explained the difficulties and risks to C in conducting any other less interventionist delivery due, in particular, to C&#8217;s inability to remain still and her unpredictable behaviour. In relation to each combination of delivery methods she was able to outline the difficulties and dangers in being able to do that with C as she currently is, recognising the need to keep the position under review.

They served the press in accordance with the practice direction. On 29 February 2016 I made a RRO which ensured orders were in place to prevent the identification of C. It became clear during the oral evidence on 1 March 2016, in particular from the consultant psychiatrist (&#8216;CP&#8217;) who is responsible for C&#8217;s clinical care, anonymisation may not sufficiently protect C. He said that due to the unusual circumstances of this application, the fact that C is probably one of a very limited number of people in her condition being detained in a mental health unit, the high risk that she would probably realise or easily learn that any report about this application, even in anonymised form, was about her would, in her current fragile mental state, risk causing her further psychological harm.</span></p>

Whilst recognising that this more restrictive RRO had not been served on the press in accordance with the practice direction, Mr Farmer, from the Press Association, was in court and given the opportunity to make any representations. In the light of the evidence the court had heard he did not oppose the revised RRO, providing there was a hearing to review the terms of the order. It was agreed a period of 14 days would give sufficient time for the birth to have taken place and the post birth position to be assessed.</span></p>

Although she was given several breaks, discussion of the possible procedures and examinations led to increased agitation and she was unable to engage with explanations of what was planned.

Mr Farmer, from the Press Association, attended the hearing on 29 February. He did not actively object to the order sought (which anonymised C, the applicants and the individuals involved in her care). He recognised in the circumstances of this case, where C was probably the only person detained in a mental health unit in that region in the advanced stages of pregnancy, if the applicants or clinicians were identified that could readily lead to C&#8217;s identification, which would further risk her mental health.</span></p>

By which time the court will be in a position to have updated assessments as to C&#8217;s mental health and enable there to be an inter parties hearing to consider any further extension of that order that may be applied for, and the evidential justification for that. It was the only proportionate course to be taken to secure the safety of C and the unborn child. The restriction on the press would be of short duration, a matter of days. In reaching this decision I recognised the press had not been served with the proposed order, but the circumstances were exceptional, needed to be dealt with urgently and the court had the benefit of the representations from Mr Farmer, who did not object to the order being made providing it was time limited.</span></p>
