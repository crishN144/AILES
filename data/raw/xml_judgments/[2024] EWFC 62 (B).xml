In the intervening period the forensic landscape has changed out of all recognition. Amongst the many advances is the advent of the smart phone and of social media in all its forms. Of particular relevance in this context is the almost universal use of email as a means of instant communication. Another development of relevance is that as a result of the withdrawal of legal aid in the majority of private law cases, a large proportion of parents are unrepresented and therefore do not have, as the judge described it in the present case, the &#8216;steadying influence&#8217; of legal advisors. </span></p>

Such behaviour may be the result of anxiety but in other cases, as in this case, it is part of a campaign of behaviour by one parent against the other which amounts to a deeply disturbing form of oppressive behaviour on their part.</span></p>

All too often such communications are ill-considered and ill-judged with the consequence that every minor dispute or misunderstanding is met with an application to the judge. More importantly, the distress and anxiety caused to the other parent and to the children at the centre of such a raging dispute cannot be overestimated, nor can the damaging consequences where the focus of the litigation veers away from what, on any objective view, would and should be regarded as the real issues going to the welfare of the children concerned. </span></p>

Neither the judge nor the court staff can, or should, be expected to field communications of this type. In my view judges must be entitled, as part of their general case management powers, to put in place, where they feel it to be appropriate, strict directions regulating communications with the court and litigants should understand that failure to comply with such directions will mean that communications that they choose to send, notwithstanding those directions, will be neither responded to nor acted upon.&#8221; </span></p>

The children have been the subject of private court proceedings brought by their father for 18 months in the first application and nearly four years in these proceedings. The children are very aware of the proceedings; they have been the subject of intervention by Cafcass, NYAS (as court appointed guardian) and the local authority (following a section 37 referral with interim care orders made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/38" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s38</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>).

Through their counsel I stated that the best outcome would be for the parents to be able to tell the children they had reached an agreement on all issues. I hoped that if this was possible it would go some way to restore the confidence in the children in their parents&#8217; ability to parent without having to be told what to do. The main sticking point in reaching an agreement was the father holding out that he wanted a shared care arrangement with one of the children. This was a wholly unreasonable position to maintain and one which the mother would (quite rightly) never agree to. The father even went so far as to submit in his closing submissions that in default of a shared care the child&#8217;s residence should be transferred to the father; a suggestion so far removed from reasonableness that it throws into question the father&#8217;s overall ability to judge how the welfare of his child should be served.</span></p>

Where a court makes an order of its own motion it is open to the court to rely upon its own experience of the parties to evaluate whether the relevant test is met and whether the making of such an order serves the welfare of the children. I make this observation because the father has submitted that the mother has failed to support her application with any or sufficient evidence. In so far as this may be accurate, in that the mother has relied on submissions made by her counsel, I make it clear that the order I will make is made both on the application of the mother and of the court&#8217;s own motion. It is for the latter reason that I am justified making judicial comment on the father&#8217;s conduct throughout this application and upon his involvement in other litigation which I have supported by reference to law reports which are in the public domain.</span></p>

This is a constancy throughout the proceedings. It is exemplified by the repeated reference to this during the father&#8217;s oral submissions. It is the father&#8217;s stated belief that because he is autistic, he is the better placed parent to help the children adjust to their neurodiversity. I have always accepted unreservedly the father&#8217;s professional diagnosis of autism. I am firmly of the view, and have stated this in a previous judgment that the mother is equally equipped to care for the welfare of the children at all levels and this includes their neurodiversity. I fear the father&#8217;s position may become stronger as time goes on and as the children grow older; he may use this to justify further applications.

The purpose of this order is primarily to avoid the children being put at further risk of harm.

The oldest child has moved to live with his father which he would probably have chosen to do without these proceedings. The children are receiving appropriate education provision; this is not a result of the proceedings. That the children have received medical assessments is not a result of these proceedings. In my judgement this application has achieved nothing to further the welfare of the children. It has only caused emotional harm to three vulnerable children who are totally reliant on their parents to provide them with stable and good enough parenting. </span></p>
