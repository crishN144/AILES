The case is listed both as a fact-finding hearing and for consideration of the welfare decisions that require to be made in respect of the children&#8217;s future. Both parents are 41 years of age. They are cousins. The father (F) has resided in the United Kingdom (UK) since September 1984, when his parents immigrated. The parents married in Kashmir in 1997. The mother (M) joined her husband in the UK in 2001. The following year, in 2002 Z was born. B was born in 2003 and J in 2005.  </p>

Though her language difficulties impede a clear assessment of her verbal reasoning, it is plain that she faces real challenges in this sphere. She has been assessed as having a learning disability.

On both occasions he gained weight but lost it again on his return home. No organic cause for the weight loss was identified. A&#8217;s weight fell below the 0.4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile, notwithstanding advice to the parents from dieticians.

Professor Mangham, Consultant Osteoarticular Pathologist, examined the rib fractures with radio graphs, naked eye inspection and with microscope. He considered, based on the microscopic findings, that after the rib fractures were sustained, A survived for a period of at least two hours or possibly longer.  </p>

He did not consider that her understanding of the process would be sufficient to enable her to provide coherent answers. It requires to be said that his views changed considerably. He explained this by identifying that his original report had been &#8220;entirely based&#8221; on his own clinical interview with M, alongside the psychometrically determined cognitive functioning tests. In his second clinical interview he noted M&#8217;s presentation &#8216;had changed&#8217;. He observes M was able to give longer answers, she was more spontaneous and she was able to read aloud in Urdu. It was this, he explained, which caused him to change his opinion. Ultimately, his evidence was that M&#8217;s competency was not static but amenable to change. It was necessary, therefore, for me to require him to attend prior to M giving her evidence to be sure that she was sufficiently competent on the day.

In his conversation with Ms Holt, the key social worker, F is recorded, by her, as saying that when he returned from the Mosque he saw blood on A&#8217;s face. To a social worker of Ms Holt&#8217;s obvious ability and experience that was plainly an important piece of information. Ms Holt made an immediate note of it in her notepad, which has been exhibited to her statement. F has now denied that he saw any blood that day. As I understand his evidence, he now suggests that he was mistaken and had confused A&#8217;s red face with a blood stain. I have endeavoured to set his account out as neutrally as I can, but it is, however carefully expressed, entirely implausible. F is an intelligent man and what is recorded by Ms Holt is an earlier account by him of his son in either a moribund condition or dead. Moreover, it is entirely inconsistent with the preponderant descriptions of A as &#8220;pale&#8221; and &#8220;yellow&#8221;. In the same note Ms Holt records F as telling her <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I thought my wife or [B] might have done something to the baby&#8221; </span>This strikes me as consistent with his report that A had &#8220;blood on his face&#8221;. I have no difficulty in accepting that F described blood on A&#8217;s face to Ms Holt (though he has been equivocal as to whether this was said) and this was precisely what he observed. His change of evidence on this point is, I find, significant. Logically, I find that F saw blood on A&#8217;s face that afternoon.  </p>

Z is a sixteen-year-old young person, estranged from her family, in foster care, giving evidence in the most difficult of circumstances. I agree with counsel that a clear picture can not be established. However, the central issue, as it has emerged, is whether I can be clear as to who was in the house at the time A was injured.  </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0in">On this theory Dr Lumb considered the following to be relevant: the rib fractures were un-displaced and had not caused any internal organ injury; and there was no significant haemorrhage associated with any of the internal injuries. He did, however, consider that sustained pressure to the chest, from front to back, could cause respiratory compromise. Further he considered that mechanical disruption to the chest by the rib fractures could also impair breathing. He emphasised that, whilst there were no asphyxial signs, this was not uncommon even in fatal cases. He considered that an association between the rib fractures and death could not be completely excluded.  </p>

In A&#8217;s case, given his age and the fact that he had teeth, Dr Lumb anticipated some injury to the lips had smothering taken place. He was pressed by Ms Delahunty on the absence of bleeding either to the mouth or on post-mortem examination of what was visible of the nasal mucosa. Dr Lumb readily accepted that the absence of these was a contra indicator to upper airway obstruction of the nose or mouth. However, he was very clear that if the court found as fact that there was blood on A&#8217;s face that would shift the differential diagnostic pointedly to this direction.  </p>

From a purely pathological perspective therefore, he could not exclude choking on a food bolus (i.e. a small rounded mass) as the cause of death.

They considered that this precluded the possibility of a compression causing fracture and leading to death two hours later. As Mr Rothery, on behalf of the Local Authority, summarises their view, both would have expected considerably more wide-spread hypoxic ischaemic injury if that were the case; neither could accept that death could follow two hours after the compression was released. Both agreed that if the interval between compression, deprivation of oxygen and death was very much shorter then compression of the chest might very well be associated with death. One aspect of the post-morbid anatomy which is potentially supportive of this explanation is the evidence of very early hypoxic changes in the brain.  </p>

F&#8217;s account is that on that afternoon he had attended at a particular Mosque in Rochdale, to listen to a seminar by a particular Cleric. He asserted that he had been directly involved in setting this event up and, as I understand his evidence, it was to have been one of a number that he had planned. The general theme, again as I understood it, was to raise awareness within the local Muslim community of some of the key issues of the day. I hope this captures the essence of what F told me on these points, but I must record that all his answers to virtually all questions asked were characterised by a torrent of rapid and not obviously relevant statements. He often became agitated and occasionally sought to present himself as a victim of some unspecified conspiracy by the professionals. Mr Spencer, in his written submissions, proffers the following summary of F&#8217;s evidence: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he appeared to demonstrate an exceptional focus on himself; he demonstrated little, if any, evidence of critical reflection on the circumstances surrounding A&#8217;s death; he dissembled and lied throughout his evidence.&#8221;</span> I agree.  </p>

Her entire account, properly analysed, points to F being present in the house for most of the afternoon. In particular Z states that her father was in the same room as her whilst B was being given a bath that afternoon. She was pressed by Ms Isaacs QC, on behalf of the father, to the effect that she was or could have been mistaken and that F was himself at the Mosque attending an event. Z, in common with her brothers, is polite, well-mannered and respectful. All the professionals have described the children in this way and properly, in my view, attribute it to an aspect of their care, by their parents, which was both good and nurturing. In her oral evidence Z was occasionally diffident and inclined to hide behind a self-effacing giggle. Ms Holt, in her own evidence, had foreshadowed this. Z accepted politely that there was a possibility that she was mistaken on this point but it was clear to me she was responding to a hypothesis. In response to Ms Isaacs last question she said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I do remember him</span> (i.e. F) <span style="font-style:italic">saying that he was going to collect J from the Mosque&#8221;.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Though I ultimately concluded that J should not give evidence and thus I am conscious that his ABE interview has not been challenged, I note that J describes his afternoon&#8217;s attendance at the Mosque that day in common place and mundane terms. He describes having visited Mosque for a study circle where the tutor <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;teaches basics, like basic stuff&#8221;</span>. None of this resonates with F&#8217;s description of the afternoon. In my judgement this accords more easily with Z&#8217;s account which, it must be emphasised, contains supportive detail. In particular, she talks of A falling asleep as J left. Though she is undoubtedly wrong in her timing, she also talks of F going to pick J up from Mosque (in the body of her interview). Perhaps most tellingly, set in the context of the above, F&#8217;s solicitors wrote to the Local Authority, by email, in December 2017 (i.e. five months after A&#8217;s death) stating in entirely unambiguous terms that F had attended the Mosque for &#8220;evening prayers and to collect J&#8221;. I conclude that as of December 2017 those were F&#8217;s instructions. Nobody has sought to persuade me otherwise. Plainly, F has changed his account on this as on other matters. Mr Rothery identifies the following inconsistencies in F&#8217;s evidence. These are largely, perhaps even entirely, accepted by F. He proffers no explanation for his changes of account:</p>

I must conclude that she is being less than candid with the Court. In this omission in her evidence, I am satisfied, Z is seeking to protect her parents. I also record that the Guardian told me in her evidence that Z had, in her opinion, developed a real capacity to disassociate herself from her circumstances. In the midst of chaos, she was able to focus in on her studies and with very great effect. As I listened to Z I formed a similar impression. She struck me as having defended herself very heavily from the grief of losing her brother. I include this as an observation which may assist those who work with her in the future but, I emphasise, it is not intended to be critical of her in any way. I am inclined to think that Z has managed to insulate her thoughts about what happened that afternoon and is to some extent unwilling to revisit the events of the day.

In my assessment she was simply doing her best, on this point, to describe what she saw. I do not think she perceived the point as evidentially significant. She told me that she had changed A&#8217;s upper and lower clothing because both were wet. She agreed that they had become wet during the course of A&#8217;s feeding. As the background history of this family shows they are not fastidious in matters of clothing and general presentation. For Z to have burdened herself with the responsibility of changing A it must have been obvious to her that he simply could not be left in that condition.

At 1852 hrs the phone records show that there was a telephone call from the main line phone in the home to F. It was only of three seconds duration. This was a signal for F to return the call on his mobile phone, in order to save money. F returned the telephone call. The account is that M rang asking F and J to come home as she had made chips for the children. I was told that she did not usually make such telephone calls. F told Dr Nawaz, the paediatrician at the hospital, that at around 7pm, while at the Mosque, M telephoned him asking him to come home as she made some chips. Dr Nawaz records that F was very clear that M did not say anything about A. Dr Nawaz goes on to note that F told him that it took five minutes to walk back to the house. He records that F enquired about A and reported that M said he was not breathing. F said he found A in the cot. He looked pale, not breathing and was cold to the touch. F reports calling the ambulance immediately and not initiating resuscitation. In evidence to me F told me that he thought A was already dead at that point. In his first interview (01.08.2017) F said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;as soon as I got home I saw the baby and like I said I had been called to a lot of community deaths and stuff like that so you know when I looked at the child I knew that he&#8217;s passed away, you know, his body was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">so</span><span style="font-weight:bold"/><span style="font-style:italic">cold, I touched his hand&#8230; his forehead, it was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">completely cold.</span><span style="font-style:italic">&#8221;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"/>(my emphasis)<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">.</span><span style="font-weight:bold"/>In his interview F said that when he got home M told him <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;look, you know the baby&#8217;s been unconscious for half an hour, can you ring the ambulance and find out what&#8217;s happening&#8230;.&#8221; </span>These two statements, much closer in time to A&#8217;s death, strike me as consistent.

The OS has taken cognisance of the fact that the mother, at no stage, whether to Dr Nawaz, the police, Dr Margison or Dr Parsons, has said that the father had any knowledge of the circumstances that led to A&#8217;s injury and demise and had specifically placed him as &#8216;out&#8217; of the house in the afternoon in the relevant window. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The OS cannot and does not advance a hypothetical case on a protected party&#8217;s behalf: there needs to be a factual foundation for the position advanced.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst Ms Delahunty is entirely right to say that it is not unusual for another party to advance a case which has the collateral effect of assisting a third party, that was not the case here. As I have stated, nobody has attempted to identify F as perpetrator of the injuries. Moreover, in an investigative (sui generis) legal framework, guided throughout by the paramountcy principle, an exploration of the facts predicated on records, documentary evidence, hearsay and legitimate inferences is both proper and necessary. As such, it is not strictly &#8216;hypothetical&#8217;. The predominant concern must always be to avoid injustice to the protected party. It is an uncomfortable experience to read a submission presented through the Official Solicitor that seeks, for example, to minimise the forensic significance of F&#8217;s observation of blood on A&#8217;s face whilst declining to explore the possibility both that it may have been there and that F may have been responsible for it. </p>

To assuage her concern it is, I hope, clear from my reasoning that I recognise that she and the Official Solicitor have taken a different view of the Official solicitor&#8217;s role in these circumstances. I am not suggesting that there has been any lack of attention to the detail of the case, the reverse is true.  I do wish to highlight my real concern that the Official Solicitor should formulate clearer guidance for the profession as to the scope and ambit of his role in these circumstances, which arise with sufficient regularity to require a clear and consistent approach.  </p>

As paragraph nine above makes clear, there were fundamental parenting failures: unsanitary home conditions; unsatisfactory personal hygiene; and failed medical appointments, including neglect of Z&#8217;s asthma. There is no doubt that F experienced Social Services as intrusive and belittling of his status within the community. As a man who perceived himself to be respected and who was called upon to help and advise others, the properly identified concerns of the Social Services undermined his status. It is clear from his frequent outbursts against the Social Workers that their presence in the life of his family was difficult for him to reconcile. In his evidence he took every opportunity to emphasise his intellectual ability. He repeatedly described himself as &#8220;a graduate&#8221;. It is manifest that F was under stress; </p>

It remains the case, however, that none of these points either collectively or individually amounts to evidence of sufficient cogency to permit me to identify the perpetrator of A&#8217;s injuries and death. None of those within the house on the afternoon A died who were in a position honestly to relate what occurred has chosen to do so. M understands what telling the truth means. For whatever reason she chose not to do so. Accordingly, I am left uncertain as to who the perpetrator was. Future planning for the children&#8217;s welfare and, in particular, their contact with their parents must be predicated on the premise that either might have been responsible for A&#8217;s death. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In considering the Local Authority&#8217;s plans for the children I have been exercised by the proposal that Z and J should be separated. Ms Humphries, the children&#8217;s Guardian, has properly gone to great lengths to review the Local Authority&#8217;s thinking on this point. She has met again with both children, during the course of the final hearing, to elicit their views as well as their feelings. A placement has been identified for Z, by Ms Holt, which she has been very enthusiastic about. It is a home which she, as a female teenage Muslim, plainly feels more comfortable about than her present foster placement. I know that in saying that she would wish me to be clear that that is not intended as any criticism of the family with whom she is now living. Unlike her brother J, Z has simply not settled. J told the Guardian that he was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;quite sad&#8221;</span> about his sister moving to a separate placement. Ms Humphries notes <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;his face portrayed a deeper sadness than he expressed&#8221;</span>. The foster carer reported that J had been quite down since learning about the plan.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The welfare of both Z and J is my paramount consideration. The best interest of one cannot be permitted to yield to the other. Z is absolutely clear that she wishes to move to this placement and her views are rooted in a calculation of what it offers to her. She is driven to succeed academically and sees this home as fertile ground for her intellectual development. It is also an entirely female household. I have no doubt that this latter point is important to her at this stage in her life.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Though J would like to be closer to his sister and his school, there is no doubt that he is doing well where he lives. His relationship with the foster father is secure and strengthening. For much of the time when Z was with her brother she retreated to her bedroom to study. J&#8217;s interests are much wider than academic and he has grown to enjoy a range of activities. Ultimately the professional consensus was that J&#8217;s interests are best met by his staying where he is and by Z being permitted to move. I agree. I should also record that I found Ms Holt&#8217;s and Ms Humphries&#8217; careful consideration of this plan to be extremely impressive. When Social Workers fall into error they are often condemned by the Court. It is right that where the Court sees, as it does here, practice of the highest standard, it should identify and record it. I am pleased to be able to do so. </p>
