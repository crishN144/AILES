This judgment carries on from the foot of that one and is based upon the factual and other findings I made in that first judgment.  This hearing has therefore been concerned to consider the significance of the findings I made and translate them into figures, and ultimately financial provision for the wife and the child,  now just 4. The child is living full time with his mother.  This second hearing has taken a further three and a half days of court time.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.31in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Let me start by stressing two matters.  Firstly, I said last time that I found this a peculiarly difficult case to decide.  I remain of that view now and especially so given the unusual factual findings which I have now made.  Secondly, I have neither read nor heard anything during the intermediate directions hearings or during this hearing which causes me any concern that my findings need reconsideration.  Indeed, on the contrary; such further evidence as I have read and heard rather confirms them in my mind.  In this respect, I am also confirmed in my findings about the parties' credibility and, finally, the overall impression the parties made on me this time is the same as during the last hearing.</span></p>

I refer to the opening passages in the first judgment in this respect.  Of course, there are many similarities, especially at this quantum stage, but the court is not, in the end, conducting the same exercise.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.31in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The wife seeks outright capital provision in the form of a lump sum of &#163;8 million, made up of the aggregate of &#163;4 million for housing and &#163;4 million for an income fund.  In addition, she seeks income provision of &#163;60,000 per annum for the child, which is the sum the husband already offers, but of course he offers that on the basis that there should be no income provision for the wife herself.  The wife also seeks an order for her costs.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.31in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The husband offers, in effect, provision on the basis that this is a quasi-claim under Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. So he offers a housing fund of &#163;2.5 million for the wife and child's benefit but only until the child has completed tertiary education - that is to say in about 20 years' time.  He also offers the &#163;60,000 per annum income provision for the child but nothing separately for the wife.</span></p>

I have also heard orally from the parties again, from the wife at some length, and from the husband much more briefly.  I had a statement, additionally from a Bahamian lawyer.  It was introduced seemingly to bolster my previous findings.  In the event, I think it was unnecessary and added nothing to what I had previously said or found.  Once again I have been treated to excellent notes, skeleton arguments and multi-coloured schedules.</span></p>

She has continued to live on her own resources, paid from her brother as dealt with in the first judgment and they are augmented by &#163;3,000 per month paid by the husband for the child.  The husband has continued his global peripatetic existence, moving from place to place and seemingly spending considerable time in hotels.</span></p>

At the moment it is non-existent.  That is not only sad but from the child's point of view, bad for his development.  It is also largely of the husband's choosing, as I find.  The mother is more than willing to reintroduce the child to father in a sensitive and child-focused way.  Unfortunately the husband sees the wife's attempts in this regard as part of a wider conspiracy by her to control him.</span></p>

Section 18 could have provided that, once England and Wales was to be regarded as the appropriate forum under section 16, then the case was to be treated as a purely English proceeding for financial relief. But it did not do so. Instead a more flexible approach was deliberately adopted. There will be some cases, with a strong English connection, where it will be appropriate to ask what provision would have been made had the divorce been granted in England. There will be other cases where the connection is not strong and a spouse has received adequate provision from the foreign court. Then it will not be appropriate for Part III to be used simply as a tool to "top-up" that provision to that which she would have received in an English divorce."</span></p>

The following general principles should be applied. First, primary consideration must be given to the welfare of any children of the marriage. This can cut both ways as the children may be being supported by the foreign spouse. Second, it will never be appropriate to make an order which gives the claimant more than she or he would have been awarded had all proceedings taken place within this jurisdiction. Third, where possible the order should have the result that provision is made for the reasonable needs of each spouse. Subject to these principles, the court has a broad discretion. The reasons why it was appropriate for an order to be made in England are among the circumstances to be taken into account in deciding what order should be made. Where the English connections of the case are very strong there may be no reason why the application should not be treated as if it were made in purely English proceedings."</span></p>

In the end I did not detect much dissent from Miss Stone about the adoption of this approach. She said, rather disarmingly in her note, "You look at all the factors; you weigh them up and you do what is right."  As an attempt to encapsulate the problems inherent in the exercise of judicial discretion in this highly discretionary field, I like and agree with that approach and have tried to adhere to it.  Anything more sophisticated risks falling back into the mire of judicial gloss again.  However, helpful to practitioners and first instance judges those glosses may have been, they are just that and tend to end up, in the end, on the scrapheap of outdated judicial pronouncement.  Of course, whether others would regard the outcome as right depends on one's perspective.</span></p>

I decline to do so both as a matter of principle in this case, for the reasons I have already said - I reject notions of sharing and also compensation - but also on the facts of this case.  There is no doubt that the wife was just beginning to make a name for herself in the design world, but she had made not a penny out of it;  on the contrary, it had cost her a considerable amount. Compensation is always a very tricky concept at the best of times.  It always runs the risk of double-counting; in this case the argument really does not get off first base, in my judgment.</span></p>

So far as the Country Y properties are concerned, the easiest way of the wife extracting money from them would be if she sold them to other members of the family.  That is not such a fanciful idea as she has regular dealings with them.  They are an attractively close-knit family who help each other out in times of need and, most importantly, they totally trust one another in matters of finance.  In this respect I think therefore &#163;7 million more nearly represents the wife's fortune, as she will be under no pressure to realise assets before they are available and has enough resources to avoid hasty sales.</span></p>

In this regard how should the remaining &#163;5 million of the wife's mainly Country Y assets be treated in this calculation? Complete amortisation over time is not fair when this is almost all old family money, but equally over time and with familial help they can be better deployed and better invested to provide her with a reasonable rate of return.  In my judgment, in this part of the calculation 3% net is fair to both sides.  That is to say &#163;150,000 per annum.</span></p>

On a Duxbury basis that would call for about a million pounds.  Is a Duxbury approach a proper way to calculate the wife's needs, given all the circumstances?   It could be considered very generous after a short marriage, but not so generous if one factors in that the wife is looking after the child throughout his minority.  A multiplier of 10 is sometimes arguable in this situation.  So it seems that the bracket for this part of the claim is between &#163;500,000 and &#163;1 million.</span></p>

I do require the sum for the child to be secured somehow as the husband's globe-trotting lifestyle would present too much of a moving target if, for any reason, the husband ceased to pay.  There is already a trust fund of a value in excess of $1 million set up to benefit the child, and by appropriate adjustments security is achievable without recourse to the provision of further funds.</span></p>

That the hearings have taken so much time and expense is due to the interplay between the unusual factual background and the recent high level case law, which significantly encourages rather than discourages lengthy debate.  That the parties have been able fully and fairly to have their cases aired and considered is beyond doubt.  Whether it is really a proper use of precious High Court time when the system is under such intense pressure from more run of the mill cases is, however, in my judgment, open to question.</span></p>
