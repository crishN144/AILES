The content of the messages convey P&#8217;s sadness at being separated from L, and her desire to live with L and the father, and also the mother&#8217;s anger upon reading the text messages. The mother is also said not to like it when P talks with the father. One message from P on 2 December 2023 stated that the mother gets really angry very frequently and it makes her cry; she does not want to live with the mother. Another message on 2 December 2023 states that P doesn&#8217;t feel safe around the mother any more. A further message records the mother having told P that she should not be talking to L five times a day and that when L goes to stay with the father and L the following year they will manipulate P to stay. Another message dated 9 December 2023 states that P is hungry but the mother did not leave her anything to eat. When questioned further by L, it emerged that the mother had in fact left her food to eat, but that it was &#8220;alot of stuff i dont like&#8221;.</p>

Whilst she did not seek to diminish P&#8217;s concerns about her mother&#8217;s behaviour towards her, there appeared to be some lack of congruence between the complete breakdown in her relationship with her mother, the depiction of more positive dynamics in the professional reports from Poland, and what P told her about her experiences in her mother&#8217;s care. For instance when exploring examples of what was &#8220;mean&#8221; behaviour, she described what might be viewed as universal tensions in expectations and relationships between a parent and a pre-adolescent child. Some of the phrases used by P, for instance working on her mental and physical health, appeared somewhat adult and atypical for an 11 year old; she could not rule out that P may have experienced some pressure that has contributed to her expressed wishes and feelings.</p>

However Ms. Huntington was struck by her emotional vulnerability, having made multiple references to feelings of unhappiness and difficulty regulating her emotions, and her body language was suggestive of stress, and she was tearful at times. Ms. Huntington considered that P felt very much at the centre of longstanding and intense parental conflict and division and separation within her family. She wanted the fighting to stop, but despite her wish for everyone to be together, she recognised that it was unfeasible. Her adverse experiences of parental hostility and repeated disruption to the family unit render her a vulnerable child whose emotional maturity and levels of resilience may be affected. </p>

Rather, the court should assume the risk of harm at its highest and then, if that risk meets the test in Art 13(b), go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm can be identified."</p>

In the father&#8217;s statement dated 11 October 2024 the allegations are made as follows &#8220;[P] has also disclosed that her mother has been physically abusive towards her and that she has on a number of occasions pushed her and been physically aggressive towards her by tugging her, grabbing her neck and &#8216;choking&#8217; her&#8221;. There are no particulars of on how many occasions this is said to have occurred, over what time period, and what happened each time, whether P required any medical treatment afterwards, and whether she told anyone other than the father, particularly at the time.  It is also surprising, given the potential gravity of the allegations of physical assault, that they come after two sentences containing allegations that the mother shouts at P and calls her names, rather than at the beginning of the paragraph, or possibly even as part of their own paragraph. It is unclear whether allegations concerning physical assault were made orally only to the father, or to L too. </p>

However these allegations are not supported by any contemporaneous evidence. The allegation was not repeated to Ms. Huntington, nor is it corroborated by any other evidence, such as the text messages. There is no evidence that such an allegation has been made by the father or P to the Polish court, and the expert report in the Polish proceedings dated 4 April 2023, in identifying a positive attitude by P towards the mother, is inconsistent with that allegation. </p>

Again, there is no indication of the frequency or duration of the adverse comments or of P being left alone, and I find that the allegations are not of sufficient detail and substance that they could constitute a grave risk. Further, as to the nature of the allegations, I agree with Ms. Huntington&#8217;s that the nature of P&#8217;s complaints as contained in her comments to her father and to her sister on text message are generally reflective of the typical frictions between a parent and an adolescent, rather than being of a more concerning nature. I find that they do not satisfy the onerous standard required under this Article. Further, they were mostly sent a year ago with there being no subsequent texts provided.  The allegations as to leaving P unsupervised are also insufficient to satisfy the high standard under this Article. Complaints as to discomfort as to men staying with her mother are of a less serious nature than the other allegations made.</p>

In December 2023 when exchanging text messages with L, she expressed a wish to live with her father and L, but it could not be inferred from that exchange that the feeling was strong. During summer 2024 she told Ms. Huntington that she enjoyed a holiday with her mother to Turkey. From 17 July 2024 onwards, having spent just over a week in the company of her father and L, she has been objecting to returning to Poland, which by 29 October was of the strength of 8 &#8211; 9/10. The reason for this dramatic change in attitude was the influence of her father and L. She candidly described to Ms. Huntington that speaking with her sister and her father led to a change in her previously negative view of her father, and Ms. Huntington concluded that she could not exclude that P may have experienced some pressure or influence that have contributed to her expressed wishes and feelings. It is relevant that there was virtually no contact with the mother during that period. I acknowledge Ms. Huntington&#8217;s assessment of the cause of the change in P&#8217;s attitude to returning to Poland, but would go further, in considering that the influence of the father and L is the primary reason for the fact that P is now objecting to returning to Poland.</p>

P had a settled and happy life in Poland before summer 2024, and although she had complaints about her relationship with her mother, those complaints were of the nature of the ordinary frictions between parents and pre-adolescent children. Although she complained to her sister of not feeling &#8220;safe&#8221; around her mother in a text on 2 December 2023, instead of that description being literally accurate, it referred to her worry that her mother would want to talk about the proceedings and where she should live.  She was generally doing well at school, except in Maths, and she had friends, although they sometimes ignored her. She spent her leisure time with her mother, doing activities such as swimming and going to the cinema. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Further deterioration and/or loss of relationship with mother. If P remains in the United Kingdom, given her current refusal to have even electronic contact with the mother, and the father and L&#8217;s ongoing supply of adverse information about the mother to P, there is a real risk that P&#8217;s relationship with the mother will be seriously prejudiced or even lost. If P is returned to Poland, it seems likely that her contact with her father and with L will continue as before.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fourth, general Convention considerations. General Convention considerations would point towards return to the state of habitual residence, and returns only being blocked in the clearest cases, otherwise it would incentivise child abductions. In this case this is the second instance of wrongful retention of a child. The father had said that he would never do it again, and would do things different[ly] in respect to his daughter P if this was required: Parenting Assessment of L dated 10 March 2022. Yet the father has nevertheless wrongfully retained his second child, relying (as he did before) on the child&#8217;s objections. This repeated conduct on the part of the father is a reason to give general Convention considerations greater weight than in the average case. The mother alleges that the father never intended to return P, but I find that the evidence does not establish that intention.</p>
