	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although this case has already generated considerable publicity, and has already been the subject of (as yet uncompleted) defamation proceedings in the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
		  <p class="FootnoteText"><span/>In 2014 the father issued libel proceedings against the publishers of the Evening Standard, the Independent and the Huffington Post. In addition, the mother has issued privacy proceedings against the father. The defamation proceedings have generated a great deal of preliminary litigation &#8211; there are no fewer than five judgments on Bailii &#8211;  but resolution of those cases seems a long way off.<span/>The principal judgments are, first, that of Sir David Eady dated 11 March 2015 (<span style="font-style:italic">Lachaux v Independent Print Ltd </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/qb/2015/620" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 620 (QB)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 620 (QB)</ref>) on the meaning of the words used in the Independent and Evening Standard reports; second, that of Mr Justice Warby dated 30 July 2015 (<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/qb/2015/2242" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 2242 (QB)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 2242 (QB)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] QB 402" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] QB 402</ref>) on whether the published words caused the father serious harm to his reputation; and third that of Sir Michael Tugendhat dated 18 December 2015 (<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/qb/2015/3677" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 3677 (QB)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 3677 (QB)</ref>) on whether an injunction should be made prohibiting the use of confidential, privileged, material belonging to the father that the mother had given to the media defendants. The judgment of Mr Justice Warby has become a test case and has been the subject of an appeal to the Court of Appeal (as has the judgment of Sir Michael Tugendhat), from where judgment is awaited.</p>
		</authorialNote> it must not be forgotten that as its very centre is a small child whose well-being is my first concern. The mother has not had direct face-to-face contact with her son since 29 October 2013 (when he was lawfully removed from her after he was located following his disappearance with her for 19 months). Until I made an order last year for twice weekly indirect contact by electronic means she had had no contact with him at all.  Since the early part of this year the indirect contact has taken place without hitches (there were problems in setting it up) and it has been very beneficial and satisfactory for both mother and son. During the hearing the father has agreed that not only will the twice weekly indirect contact continue but also that he will bring Louis from Dubai to this country next month so that he can see his mother in a supported setting. He also agrees that thereafter he will bring Louis here for him to see his mother in a supported setting at least twice a year. Further, he will make Louis available for contact to his mother in Dubai, or, if the mother prefers, in Oman, whenever she reasonably seeks it. The mother however says that she will not contemplate under any circumstances returning to Dubai or, for that matter, to any other country in Arabia or the Middle East.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the reasons set out below I will dismiss the mother&#8217;s application and grant the father&#8217;s applications. However, I do not want the father to misunderstand the seriousness of the promises which he has made to me. I find myself powerless to make final orders for contact in the mother&#8217;s favour for legal reasons. However, the father has made his proposals for contact to me directly and I have had to treat him as acting with sincerity. The father may not recognise any qualities in the mother as mother (or indeed at all) and has not promoted Louis&#8217;s relationship with his mother for years; and the mother certainly does not recognise any qualities in the father as father (or indeed at all). However, they are each parents of this small boy and, as we all know, the child is the father of the man. The man that he develops into depends on him having a relationship with each of his parents. This means that while he will grow up in the primary care of his father, for the foreseeable future in Dubai, he must have a reasonable relationship with his mother. It would be psychologically damaging for him, in my opinion, were he to grow up without meaningful maternal influence. </p>

He should understand that while I may not have any power to entertain an application for contact I do have a residual inherent power, to be exercised only in exceptional circumstances, to protect the welfare of a British citizen abroad who is a minor. That power includes making an order that such a child be brought to this jurisdiction. If the father breaks his promises to me then I will have to give serious consideration on a later date to making such an order.</p>

She is a British citizen of Bangladeshi origin who was then married to her second husband. She was unemployed at the time, but had been a senior civil servant in this country. Between December 2008 and September 2009 the two went on a series of vacations together in Paris, USA, Turkey, Qatar, Dubai, and Cuba. From about February 2009 they were in a relationship, and from about March/April 2009 discussed getting married. In September of 2009 the claimant learned that the mother was pregnant with their son. She accepted his proposal in January 2010, and on 26 February 2010 they were married at The Old Marylebone Town Hall, London. There was a wedding lunch afterwards at a restaurant, attended by a dozen people. The couple then made their way to Dubai separately after that. Louis was born in Dubai on 4 April 2010.</p>

The reception went ahead, however, with some 40 guests. In due course the marital relationship deteriorated to such an extent that in April 2011 the claimant petitioned for divorce in Dubai.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The United Arab Emirates constitute a foreign jurisdiction with which this country has a particularly close historical connection. Orders issued by courts of the Emirates are entitled to the regard which we would expect the courts of the Emirates to have for our orders. In my opinion the courts of this jurisdiction should be very slow to make orders that directly conflict with pre-existing orders in any friendly foreign state. The principle of comity requires no less. Particularly is this so where the order, as in this case, is unenforceable and thus empty. The temptation to make conflicting orders arises from a contemplation of the gulf between legal systems based on a Judaeo-Christian model and legal systems applying the Sharia law. But if there is to be progress in the development of understanding and collaboration in international family law it is vital that we should attempt to build bridges over the divide rather than to issue empty challenges. Of course no court in this jurisdiction would have ordered a transfer of residence from the mother to the father on the application of the paramount welfare test. The fact that that was the outcome in Dubai, even the fact that that would have probably been the outcome in Dubai without compromise, does not mean that the welfare of the child is not the first consideration for the judge of the Sharia court. Both systems are child centred. It is the interpretation of child welfare, governed as it is by different religions, cultures and traditions, that produces such starkly different outcomes. In the years ahead it is to be hoped that there will be more frequent and profounder exchanges between diplomats, policy makers and judges to ensure that these differences of interpretation are not magnified by ignorance and misunderstanding.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Kolkiewicz, consultant psychiatrist, with my permission provided a detailed report concerning the mother&#8217;s mental health. She had examined the mother for three hours and had been given sight of her medical records. She was cross-examined on behalf of each parent for some hours.  Her opinion is that the mother has suffered from recurrent depressive disorder since 1992 and that the current episode has been ongoing since her post-natal period in 2010. In addition, she is of the opinion that the mother is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in relation to the removal of Louis from her on 29 October 2013. Dr Kolkiewicz accepted that without corroborative history and on the basis of the mother&#8217;s self-report it is difficult to comment on how her depressive disorder may have affected her functioning between 2010 and 2014. In my judgment the same reasoning must equally apply to the post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis. Dr Kolkiewicz accepted that the mother&#8217;s condition could not act to absolve her from responsibility for her conduct. Further, she accepted that the mother was not incapacitated within the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.</p>

Initially, she included not only the father as defendant but also his solicitors in the libel proceedings, Taylor Hampton. Later, she discontinued the action against Taylor Hampton and was ordered to pay their costs in the sum of &#163;16,000, which she has not paid. In paragraph 1 of her particulars of claim she stated &#8220;the claimant was previously married to the first defendant until a divorce was granted in August 2012&#8221;. The divorce there referred to is, of course, the Dubai divorce which the mother was then asserting had effectively dissolved the marriage. In paragraph 2 of the particulars she stated:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are two distinct legal questions. The first concerns the status of the Dubai Divorce. If this is entitled to be recognised, then it follows that the later decrees nisi and absolute obtained by the mother in the Family Court at Bury St Edmunds are nullities and must be set aside. The restriction on appealing a decree absolute set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/18" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref> has nothing to do with setting aside a decree which is null and void. That section (which in fact is now redundant as no appeal from a divorce decree has its destination in the Court of Appeal) is talking about an appeal on the merits. Where there was no question as to the court&#8217;s power to entertain the divorce suit a party cannot appeal a decree absolute to the Court of Appeal if he or she had time and opportunity to appeal against the preceding decree nisi. The idea plainly is to stop opportunistic late appeals or second bites from the cherry. It has nothing to do with the situation where it is said that the court had no power to grant the decree nisi or absolute in the first place because there was no subsisting marriage to dissolve, it having been validly dissolved earlier elsewhere.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Kendall v Kendall</span>, the wife was deceived by the husband's lawyers into applying for a divorce which she did not want in a language which she did not understand. It was held that recognition would be refused in England on the ground of public policy. The only other case in which a foreign divorce has been refused recognition solely on this ground seems to be <span style="font-style:italic">B v B (Divorce: Northern Cyprus)</span>, which concerned a divorce granted in the &#8220;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&#8221;, which is not recognised by the United Kingdom. However, this was not followed (after submissions on behalf of the Attorney-General and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs) in <span style="font-style:italic">Emin v Yeldag</span>, where it was held that a divorce granted in Northern Cyprus would be recognised in England if it was obtained in accordance with the relevant conditions applicable to that part of Cyprus. The word &#8220;manifestly&#8221; is probably redundant. It appears in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/51/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.51(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> because it appears in Art.10 of the Convention, where it was inserted to discourage the excessive reliance by the courts of some countries on alleged grounds of public policy. On the other hand, English judges have claimed a &#8220;residual discretion&#8221; to refuse recognition to divorces which offended their sense of justice, and have occasionally exercised it. This discretion appears to have been abolished by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, and such divorce could now be refused recognition only on the statutory ground of public policy. If an English judge concludes that recognition would be manifestly contrary to public policy, refusal of recognition must follow; there is no further discretion. The fact that a foreign decree was obtained in breach of a <span style="font-style:italic">Hemain</span> injunction issued by the English court will not in itself justify refusal of recognition. So, a Russian decree obtained in such circumstances was recognised, given that the Russian court was made aware of the injunction and there were no procedural defects in that court.</p>

The jurisprudence under the recast Brussels I Regulation (No 1215/2012) and its predecessors (No 44/2001, and the Brussels Convention of 1968) highlight just how exceptionally difficult it is to mount a challenge under this head.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The first ground is that recognition of the foreign judgment would be manifestly contrary to public policy in the State where its recognition or enforcement is sought. The public policy exception is to operate only in exceptional circumstances, a fact which is reinforced by the incorporation of the word &#8220;manifestly&#8221; into Art.34(1). The European Court, in interpreting the corresponding provision in Art.27(1) of the Brussels Convention, provided a definition of when recognition may be said to be contrary to public policy: whereas the content of English public policy is a matter of English law alone, the role of that public policy within the framework of the Regulation and the Convention is a matter for the European Court. Before it may find recognition contrary to public policy, the court addressed must conclude that recognition would conflict, to an unacceptable degree, with the legal order in the State of recognition because it would infringe a fundamental principle, or would involve a manifest breach of a rule of law which is regarded as fundamental within that legal order. Accordingly, where the adjudicating court had refused to hear a defendant who had placed himself in contempt of court, the recognising court was entitled to consider this to be a violation of Art.6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and to refuse to recognise the judgment. By contrast, where the adjudicating court had misapplied European competition law, the effect could not be regarded as the manifest breach of a fundamental right, serious enough to raise issues of public policy, especially as the adjudicating court had a proper procedure for the correction of errors by appeal or review.&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">While everyone knows that memory is fallible, I do not believe that the legal system has sufficiently absorbed the lessons of a century of psychological research into the nature of memory and the unreliability of eyewitness testimony. One of the most important lessons of such research is that in everyday life we are not aware of the extent to which our own and other people's memories are unreliable and believe our memories to be more faithful than they are. Two common (and related) errors are to suppose: (1) that the stronger and more vivid is our feeling or experience of recollection, the more likely the recollection is to be accurate; and (2) that the more confident another person is in their recollection, the more likely their recollection is to be accurate.</p>

		  </level>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Underlying both these errors is a faulty model of memory as a mental record which is fixed at the time of experience of an event and then fades (more or less slowly) over time. In fact, psychological research has demonstrated that memories are fluid and malleable, being constantly rewritten whenever they are retrieved. This is true even of so-called 'flashbulb' memories, that is memories of experiencing or learning of a particularly shocking or traumatic event. (The very description 'flashbulb' memory is in fact misleading, reflecting as it does the misconception that memory operates like a camera or other device that makes a fixed record of an experience.) External information can intrude into a witness's memory, as can his or her own thoughts and beliefs, and both can cause dramatic changes in recollection. Events can come to be recalled as memories which did not happen at all or which happened to someone else (referred to in the literature as a failure of source memory).</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The process of civil litigation itself subjects the memories of witnesses to powerful biases. The nature of litigation is such that witnesses often have a stake in a particular version of events. This is obvious where the witness is a party or has a tie of loyalty (such as an employment relationship) to a party to the proceedings. Other, more subtle influences include allegiances created by the process of preparing a witness statement and of coming to court to give evidence for one side in the dispute. A desire to assist, or at least not to prejudice, the party who has called the witness or that party's lawyers, as well as a natural desire to give a good impression in a public forum, can be significant motivating forces.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Considerable interference with memory is also introduced in civil litigation by the procedure of preparing for trial. A witness is asked to make a statement, often (as in the present case) when a long time has already elapsed since the relevant events. The statement is usually drafted for the witness by a lawyer who is inevitably conscious of the significance for the issues in the case of what the witness does nor does not say. The statement is made after the witness's memory has been "refreshed" by reading documents. The documents considered often include statements of case and other argumentative material as well as documents which the witness did not see at the time or which came into existence after the events which he or she is being asked to recall. The statement may go through several iterations before it is finalised. Then, usually months later, the witness will be asked to re-read his or her statement and review documents again before giving evidence in court. The effect of this process is to establish in the mind of the witness the matters recorded in his or her own statement and other written material, whether they be true or false, and to cause the witness's memory of events to be based increasingly on this material and later interpretations of it rather than on the original experience of the events.</p>

Such questions are misguided in at least two ways. First, they erroneously presuppose that there is a clear distinction between recollection and reconstruction, when all remembering of distant events involves reconstructive processes. Second, such questions disregard the fact that such processes are largely unconscious and that the strength, vividness and apparent authenticity of memories is not a reliable measure of their truth.&#8221;</p>

Credibility covers the following problems. First, is the witness a truthful or untruthful person? Secondly, is he, though a truthful person, telling something less than the truth on this issue, or, though an untruthful person, telling the truth on this issue? Thirdly, though he is a truthful person telling the truth as he sees it, did he register the intentions of the conversation correctly and, if so, has his memory correctly retained them? Also, has his recollection been subsequently altered by unconscious bias or wishful thinking or by over-much discussion of it with others? Witnesses, especially those who are emotional, who think that they are morally in the right, tend very easily and unconsciously to conjure up a legal right that did not exist. It is a truism, often used in accident cases, that with every day that passes the memory becomes fainter and the imagination becomes more active. For that reason, a witness, however honest, rarely persuades a Judge that his present recollection is preferable to that which was taken down in writing immediately after the accident occurred. Therefore, contemporary documents are always of the utmost importance. And lastly, although the honest witness believes he heard or saw this or that, it is so improbable that it is on balance more likely that he was mistaken? On this point it is essential that the balance of probability is put correctly into the scales in weighing the credibility of a witness. And motive is one aspect of probability. All these problems compendiously are entailed when a Judge assesses the credibility of a witness; they are all part of one judicial process. And in the process contemporary documents and admitted or incontrovertible facts and probabilities must play their proper part.&#8221;</p>

It is frequently very difficult to tell whether a witness is telling the truth or not; and where there is a conflict of evidence such as there was in the present case, reference to the objective facts and documents, references to the witness' motives and to the overall probabilities can be of very great assistance to a Judge in ascertaining the truth.&#8221;</p>

It is certainly often difficult to tell whether a witness is telling the truth and I agree with the view of Mr Justice Bingham that the demeanour of a witness is not a reliable pointer to his or her honesty<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">

For me, that is a secondary source of evidence for determining what actually happened at that time. In my judgment, I should first rely on the contemporary documents. The mother plainly recognises that, as her response to some difficult contemporary documents was to say that the father had forged them. I have reached the conclusion that both parties have told me lies from the witness box, although the mother&#8217;s lies have been more extensive than those of the father. I have not reached this conclusion in reliance on the demeanour of the parents.</p>

The father produced an email from the mother to the British Consulate dated 10 February 2010 about the registration of the forthcoming birth in which she described herself as an &#8220;Indian Christian&#8221;, when in fact she was neither. The father relies on this as showing that right from the start the mother was prone to telling lies. The mother claimed that the email was a forgery. She said to me &#8220;I don&#8217;t recognise this&#8221;.  I am completely satisfied that it is genuine.  </p>

There is little point in sending recriminations or throwing accusatory insults at each other. It is the end of the road for us and I have no more energy to disagree, fight or argue with you anymore. It is clear that our relationship is poisoned and irrevocably damaged. I agree that we should not speak or see each other. I did not have a chance to tell you this morning. But ironically you will get your wish not to see me as I have my final interview next week, so I will not be able to fly back to the UAE anyway. I have sought advice from a family lawyer friend and I should be able to get an annulment as we had married at the beginning of the year.&#8230; I will go and see the lawyer on Monday morning to kick things off&#8230; I do not want to drag this out any longer than I have to.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This email to my mind accurately describes the state of the marriage at that time. The parties were mutually engaged in the throwing of accusatory insults, as the mother frankly put it. The mother had already obtained legal advice. Her conduct, described in her own words, is not very consistent with someone disabled by depression or under the coercive control of her husband. Significantly, the email reveals that at that time the mother was being interviewed for employment in the UK. Again, that is not consistent with her case that the father prevented her from seeking employment. The employment in question is described in an email sent by the mother to a friend a few days earlier on 4 October 2010 (she accepts it is genuine). In that email she describes how she was arriving at Heathrow on 6 October 2010 and had an interview for an &#8220;international role&#8221; with a business at its headquarters in Watford the following day.</p>

The father produced an email sent by the mother to a participant who was more than just a close friend on 27 October 2010 together with photographs taken by him (I assume with his mobile phone) of texts on the mother&#8217;s Blackberry between her and this man between 26 October and 9 December 2010. In order to obtain these photographs of the mother&#8217;s Blackberry the father must have found out her password. The mother said that this email and these &#8220;screen grabs&#8221; were all forgeries, but it is quite obvious that they are genuine. Quite apart from the technical challenges in re-creating on a Blackberry this sequence of texts the fact is that they are all written in the mother&#8217;s distinctive language and describe events that actually happened (e.g. staying in a hotel sharing a room with her friend Nadia). It is noteworthy that the first time that the mother has ever alleged that these documents are forgeries was in the proceedings before me. She has not said in either the libel or privacy proceedings that these documents were forgeries. Rather, her position must be taken to have been that they were authentic but obtained illegitimately.</p>

Again, this shows to my mind not only the poverty of the marriage but that the mother was a free spirit doing exactly what she wanted, where she wanted, with whom she wanted. It is a far cry from the case of grinding depression and coercive control painted in her carefully prepared witness statements.</p>

The note states &#8220;she is now concerned and is asking what her options are of getting a British passport for her baby&#8221;. The official told her that in the UAE the father had more rights than the mother (the note does not explain why or how) and encouraged her to sort things out with her husband.

I have seen a sharia lawyer in Dubai who has advised me that our marriage is illegal under sharia law and that any child of the marriage (given that Louis was born two months after our marriage) born to a Muslim parent will be awarded to that parent. Court action has serious consequences for both of us which will ultimately result in jail and deportation for us both. The law is very clear on this matter.</p>

He had intended also to apply for custody of Louis but he says his lawyer failed to include that claim and that it was not rectified until April 2012. This is surprising, but the father was not challenged on this. A reconciliation session was fixed before a mediator (known as a Mutawa) for 26 April 2011. As with many other countries (such as France) you cannot commence divorce proceedings in the UAE until you have been through a reconciliation session.</p>

The father had arranged for his parents to care for Louis during this period. On 17 April 2011 the mother recovered the care and control of Louis with the assistance of the police. The police temporarily took the mother&#8217;s passport as a condition for having custody of Louis; it was returned to her on about 2 May 2011. On about 17 April 2011 the father applied without notice for an order preventing Louis&#8217;s removal from the jurisdiction of Dubai. This was granted on 19 April 2011. Such an order would likely have been made here in the same circumstances. The mother learned about this order at an early stage and instructed lawyers to contest it. </p>

The mother did not attend the reconciliation session &#8211; she may well not have known of it. Following that session, the father was permitted to commence divorce proceedings which he did in the Non-Muslim Status Court relying on Article 117 of the Code. He did not seek a religious Islamic divorce. The mother says that the divorce application was not served on her but that is not a tenable complaint since, as I shall show, she attended one hearing in the proceedings and was legally represented at seven out of 18 hearings.  She also filed an extensive defence and counter-claim.</p>

First, the father discovered that a fake Facebook page had been set up in his name. The pages stated that the father was seeking an &#8220;inter-racial relationship&#8221;; that he was &#8220;anti-Islamic&#8221; and &#8220;anti-sharia law&#8221; and that he was prepared to &#8220;slander&#8221; Dubai. This was obviously very dangerous for the father, and he immediately made a complaint to the police about it. On 12 June 2011 the father was summoned to attend a meeting with his superiors at Panasonic. His superior referred to the Facebook page and also to emails which he had received from the mother which contained &#8220;very strong allegations&#8221; against the father and which further stated that she (the mother) was able to &#8220;see everything&#8221; the father did on his computer. The father sought to explain the true situation to his superiors. Notwithstanding this he was dismissed on 14 June 2011. The father later won an unfair dismissal case against Panasonic in the courts of Dubai. He has since obtained alternative employment.</p>

On 12 June 2011 the mother again did not attend the hearing and the order records the father&#8217;s lawyer stating that her whereabouts were unknown. The lawyer asked (a) for an adjournment so that the mother&#8217;s whereabouts could be investigated, and (b) for an order for temporary contact. The court adjourned the case to 30 June 2011 and awarded interim contact for two hours on a Friday from 17:00 to 19:00 at a contact centre. In the circumstances this was a very modest order, and favourable to the mother. It is noteworthy that the order did not disturb the primary day-to-day care of the child by the mother notwithstanding that they were both missing. In contrast, in this jurisdiction one could well see in similar circumstances a collection order being made requiring the Tipstaff to find and collect the child and to hand him to the father.</p>

The mother alleges that she was there assaulted by a female police officer and that she and Louis were kept in a cell without food and water for six hours. For reasons which now perhaps have become obvious, I am not prepared to accept the uncorroborated evidence of the mother. The mother was allowed to call the British Consulate from the police station and their note timed at 12:19 does confirm that the mother stated that she was being held without food and water, although the note does not record her saying that this had gone on for six hours. There is no reference in that note to her having been assaulted by a police officer. It would appear that on that occasion the police re-seized the mother&#8217;s passport, which is hardly surprising. The father attended at the police station. The mother says that he threatened her there with &#8220;consequences&#8221; if she did not allow him to see their son. I would not be surprised if the father had said that there would be consequences if the mother did not comply with the court order for contact.</p>

An identical notice in Arabic had been published on 21 July 2011 in the Al Khaleej newspaper. I am satisfied that through her own lawyers the mother must have been well aware of these hearings.</p>

First, it was untrue for the mother to say that the father had a recorded history of sexual offences. It is true that in 2004 an American court made a restraining order against him at the suit of his then girlfriend. But there was no allegation of sexual misconduct, let alone a conviction. Second, given that the mother had engineered the dismissal of the father from Panasonic, and with it his right of residence, it was brave of her, to say the least, to rely on his apparent illegal presence in Dubai.</p>

It is inconceivable that her lawyer would not have known of these hearings (if only by reading the newspapers) and would not have told the mother about them. The real reason that the mother did not engage was, in my judgment, because she was determined not to allow the father to see his son, even for the limited two hour supervised sessions provided for in the order of 12 June 2011. Apart from glimpsing Louis at the police station on 13 June 2011 the father had not laid eyes on his son since 15 April 2011 &#8211; for more than six months.</p>

This was the first event in the proceedings attended by the mother. It was agreed that Louis would remain in the mother&#8217;s care. The father would have contact, every Friday from 5 PM to 7 PM in Al-Safa park. The father agreed that the &#8216;arraignment order&#8217; (which I take to be the order for the mother&#8217;s arrest for not attending hearings) would be cancelled.</p>

It makes a number of factual assertions which, as I say, could only have derived from the mother&#8217;s instructions. For example, it asserts that the father had a &#8220;huge salary of AED 21,700 monthly&#8221;. It asserts that the mother &#8220;left her country of origin and [went] to USA looking for [a] job to be able to pay necessary expenses for her and their child after [the father] declined and refused to pay the necessary expenses&#8221;. These factual assertions can only have been made if the mother had instructed Mrs Makki to make them. In my judgment it is not true for the mother to suggest that all this was invented by her own lawyer.</p>

The mother produces a witness statement of a friend who accompanied her during the contact visit which states that during the handover the father pushed the mother to the ground. The father denies this and says that the mother had tried to grab Louis from him before his time was up and in so doing fell to the ground. In this he is supported by the evidence of a woman, unknown to either party, who observed the incident and gave a statement to the police. I am unable to determine who is telling the truth about this. However, I note that the matter was carefully investigated by the public prosecutor, the mother having made a complaint, but he (the public prosecutor) concluded that there was no case for the father to answer.</p>

In her chronology it is stated that she attended that hearing &#8220;after being informed about it by the refuge&#8221;, but I cannot accept that. She attended because she knew about it through her attorney who had submitted the extensive defence and counterclaim on her behalf. Because Louis was crying in court she was asked by the judge to take him outside so that the proceedings would not be disrupted. However, she was fully represented by Mrs Makki throughout. The mother alleges that the court heard evidence in secret from the father&#8217;s witnesses, implying that the exercise was akin to the procedure in the Star Chamber, but the reality is much more banal that. The mother was not present simply because she was asked to take Louis out so that the proceedings would not be disrupted. The father had brought four witnesses but the court only allowed him to call two. These were police officers. I remind myself that at that stage the father&#8217;s claim was confined to divorce and access &#8211; he was not claiming custody. His witnesses were giving evidence about &#8220;prejudice&#8221; for the purposes of proving a case under Article 117. However, it is true that one of witness did give the opinion that in view of the disappearance of the mother with the child and her refusal to allow the father access she should be deprived of custody.</p>

The judge did not even want to listen to me. &#8230; I have to prepare my witnesses. She [the caseworker] was very critical of my lawyers and told me that I should complain to them as they have a duty to explain and translate everything to me. I told her I had bitter experiences with all the sharia lawyers I have had. All of them have operated in the same unscrupulous way. &#8230; There is no point in me pleading to go home. I will never get out of this nightmare. His threats, the police persecution, proof positive now that I know he has these corrupt officers on his side, they will stop at nothing. I told the embassy and everyone all along that he bribes the police and they stitch me up. They never took any of my complaints seriously and when I was assaulted I had to argue to have a case opened. Now I know why the officers at Bur Dubai police station treated me so badly. Their attendance at court is proof of the lengths they will go to. The public prosecutor is also victimising me. I am not safe here and fear that they will do more things against me. So many times he threatened he would use the police and courts against me. And now he is succeeding. It is grossly unjust and persecution&#8221;</p>

Her principal ground for seeking the change of custody from that which had previously been ordered on 12 August 2012 was that the earlier order was invalid, because it had incorrectly determined that she was a Christian. This was contrary to the truth, she claimed.  She sought a declaration that her marriage, in fact, was invalid because she was a Muslim and because a mixed marriage in Dubai is not possible.  In those circumstances, she sought to argue that the father had no rights in relation to the child and that she should be awarded custody.</p>

In the final hearing, which was held on 30 April 2014, her attorney submitted a final memorandum repeating her previous statement.  On that day, 30 April 2014, the mother was not, in fact, present in Dubai. She had left some 28 days earlier, on 2 April 2014, in circumstances where she said that she was in peril of persecution or incarceration or both. It is significant that, notwithstanding that she was absent from Dubai, she was still maintaining to the court in Dubai, exactly four weeks later, her argument that custody should be transferred to her on the legal ground which I have mentioned, and, in the alternative, that she should be awarded supervised contact twice a week in Dubai.</p>

As will by now be apparent I reject the majority of the mother&#8217;s case.  I do not accept that she was a victim of abuse, threats and violence from the father, although I do accept that the relationship was stormy and that in the course of frequent arguments each hurled accusatory insults at the other. I do not accept that she was fearful of him. I do not accept that her complaints were not investigated or taken seriously by the police and the court. I do not accept that she was mistreated by the police. I emphatically do not accept that she lived in hiding as she was fearful of the father and the authorities. She went underground to prevent the father seeing his child and because she feared she would lose the case brought by him. I do not accept that she was trapped in Dubai as a result of travel bans or confiscation of her passport. After she was found she was able to leave without let or hindrance. I do not accept that she did not have notice of the divorce proceedings or the opportunity to participate in them. She did participate in them and filed an extensive defence and counterclaim. I do not accept that she did not have adequate representation and did not have the means to secure adequate representation. I do not accept that the proceedings were unfair. The ground for divorce used in this case is virtually identical to our most commonly used one (unreasonable behaviour), and the custody laws are best interests based. The mother was not divorced on traditional Islamic grounds and sharia judges did not steal her son. </p>

However neither of these conditions affect her capacity or absolve her from responsibility for her conduct. I do accept that until I intervened the father had failed to promote the relationship between mother and Louis.

The application was heard on 16 September 2015 and judgment was given on 14 October 2015 by Judge Kurz. In his judgment Judge Kurz curiously describes the Dubai divorce as a &#8216;talaq&#8217;, when it was, as I have explained, nothing of the sort. However, Judge Kurz was satisfied that the judgment should nonetheless be recognised under the bilateral treaty. Judge Kurz was plainly troubled by the reference in the Dubai judgment to the &#8220;defendant&#8217;s refusal to obey her husband&#8221; but concluded that whilst that could not be expressed in a French ruling it could nonetheless not be grounds for a refusal of recognition since that finding was not crucial amongst those issued by the Dubai judge.</p>

Even though the mother had been hiding for several months she had not demonstrated that she was deprived of any contact with her attorney or that it was impossible for her to defend herself through him (sic).

Given that the father intends to appeal it is as well that I keep my observations to a minimum. I can well see that a reference to a wife not obeying her husband is objectionable, as Judge Kurz noted. However, it is clear that article 117 of the Federal Law No. 28 of 2005 on Personal Status is indeed reciprocal. I can accept that it would probably be unlikely that in Dubai a wife would ever achieve a finding that her husband had refused to obey her; but the law itself is gender neutral. It does not say that a complaint about going to nightclubs can only be made by men. The finding in question was not a &#8220;provision&#8221; of the law. It is no more than a finding of prejudice which is all that the law requires. I have stated above that the finding could equally have been expressed as a refusal by the wife to comply with the reasonable requests of the husband. Had that been the case then it is hard to see what objection could have been taken to it.</p>

It was issued on 5 October 2015 at 14:28 and given the case number BV15D12659. It pleaded that the marriage was formed on 26 February 2010, and that it was still subsisting. She alleged that the marriage had broken down irretrievably and in support of that she stated that the respondent had behaved in such a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him. In part 6 of her petition, where she sets out details of the father&#8217;s behaviour she said that Louis was &#8220;currently resident with the [father] under a sharia custody order&#8221;. She prayed that the court should dissolve her marriage; that the father should pay costs; that she should be granted the full range of ancillary relief; and that orders should be made for financial provision for Louis. The addresses for service for the father she gave as: (1) c/o his solicitors in the libel proceedings, Taylor Hampton, and (2) at the former matrimonial home in Dubai.</p>

If there is revealed in the petition the existence of an overseas divorce which may be entitled to recognition under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/45" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 45</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref>, then the court has a duty to investigate that pursuant to its obligation under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>. This may require the matter to be listed for a hearing.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am wholly satisfied for the reasons I have set out at length above that the mother had knowledge of the proceedings in Dubai and a full opportunity to participate in them. Indeed, she did participate in them. I am satisfied that the proceedings were fair, and that the Dubai court gave the mother much latitude. The mother does not even begin to scratch the surface of demonstrating that this UAE divorce is contrary to English and Welsh public policy. On the contrary, I am satisfied that the divorce ground under Article 117 is entirely consistent with our public policy as it is virtually the same as the ground for divorce that is principally used here. I do not agree that the language used by the Dubai court renders its decision contrary to the public policy of this country.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The consequence of this decision is that all of the proceedings issued by the mother must be discharged. With the revocation of the English divorce proceedings the mother has no jurisdictional basis left under the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> to pursue relief under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am wholly satisfied that the decision of Mr Justice Bodey in <span style="font-style:italic">J v U (Child Arrangements Order: Jurisdiction) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2017] 2 WLR 760" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] 2 WLR 760</ref> is correct. I take the view that the residual jurisdiction provided for in 2(1)(b)(i) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> (&#8220;the question of making the order arises in or in connection with matrimonial proceedings&#8221;) has become redundant with the repeal of both <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/41" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 41</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>. Like Mr Justice Bodey I struggle to envision a child case that arises &#8220;in connection with&#8221; the divorce now that the processes have been completely delinked. I am not sure I agree that if the allegations made in the child case happened to correspond to allegations of unreasonable behaviour in the divorce petition then the necessary connection would be made. It seems to me that while <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/41" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 41</ref> and 42 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref> were in force then the idea of a child related application &#8220;in&#8221; (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42</ref>) or &#8220;in connection with&#8221; (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/41" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 41</ref>) the divorce is very apt. But with the repeal of those sections the platforms fall away. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I think it is time to recognise that there are now no imaginable circumstances where it can be said that a child issue arises &#8220;in connection with&#8221; matrimonial proceedings. In any event I consider that this provision now has very strange discriminatory aspects to it and that a purposive view of its utility should conclude that it is now redundant. The provision can only apply if neither Council Regulation No. 2201/2003 nor the 1996 Hague Convention applies. So it is not available if the country of habitual residence is Morocco (a 1996 country) but it might be if it is the UAE (which is not a 1996 country). It is not available if it is Australia (a 1996 country) but it might be if it is New Zealand (not a 1996 country). It is available if the parents were married (or civilly partnered) and their union was dissolved here. It is not available if the parents were unmarried. It is impossible to justify rationally. In paragraph 16 of his decision Mr Justice Bodey states that because the words are alive in a statute they must be applied. I am of the view that it is possible for an un-repealed statutory provision to become redundant or obsolete (see, for an example, para 22 above).</p>

They should act as a form of closure between them. It is now time for them to move on and to put the past behind them and to work together as parents in the upbringing of their son. I reiterate that Louis&#8217;s well-being will be seriously compromised if he does not have a meaningful relationship with each of his parents.</p>
