	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">It can immediately be seen by the case number of this matter that it has been ongoing for nearly 5 years. I do not need in this judgment to recite the history of the case, but in very brief summary the parents separated almost 8 years ago, and the children remained living with the mother.  An order was made for the children to spend substantial time with the father after a contested hearing in December 2016.  Further proceedings were taken which concluded with the order of December 2016 being varied in March 2019.  A consent order was made which slightly reduced the time the children spent with their father.  </span></p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">These proceedings started in November 2019, when the father started enforcement proceedings. The court made the children parties at a hearing on 5 June 2020.  Various allegations were made by each parent against each other, a psychological report was prepared, and I heard the case over a number of days in 2021, handing down the written judgment on 24 March 2021.  The finding of fact hearing was my first involvement with the case.  The evidence that I considered was set out within a bundle of 2800 pages, and there was in addition a &#8216;communication bundle&#8217; of 1200 pages, which at times included hundreds of pages of emails between the parents. </span></p>

That is a very substantial judgment.  It is 84 pages long, with 359 paragraphs.  It commences with a history of the proceedings, and the events of that hearing.  It sets out the law that needed to be applied. I heard evidence from both parents, the expert witness, the father&#8217;s partner, and 3 further witnesses one for the father and two for the mother.  The allegations were set out in Scott schedules, and both parents made allegations against each other.  I considered the evidence for each allegation and made findings with my reasons for those findings. </span></p>

Whilst (the father) has not always behaved appropriately, nothing that he has done explains the difficulties in the children&#8217;s relationship with him. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The position in relation to the children is that following that finding of fact judgment both parents agreed and committed to a substantial programme of therapy and work, with a view to increasing the time that the children spent with their father, and improving relationships between the parents.  Given the amount of work needed, and the significant history of this matter, I allowed the case to continue for some time in the hope that progress would be made. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The case has however been substantially delayed over the last year due to the significant illness of the guardian, which has been recurring and caused a number of hearings to be vacated.  At the final hearing of this matter listed on 18 January 2024 the father sought permission of the court to withdraw his enforcement application, and that was granted.  There is still an order in force for time that the children spend with him  There is no need in this judgment to set out in detail the reasons for that, but there are still very substantial difficulties with the children spending time with their father, and indeed their willingness to spend time with him appears to have become worse since the issue of the 2021 judgment being published has been raised with them.  </span></p>

Directions were therefore made at that hearing for that issue to be properly argued as I was told the mother and the guardian opposed that.   That has taken some time to occur due to the unfortunate illness of the guardian.</span></p>

In summary, he is extremely critical of delays in the proceedings leading up to the finding of fact hearing in March 2021.   He is critical of the involvement of many professionals.  He sets out his concern that arrangements for the children to spend time with him by mid 2023 had deteriorated, and links that with the Guardian having discussions with the children about the judgment being published.</span></p>

He and the mother have very different views as to the actions each other and the professionals had taken in these proceedings since the finding of fact hearing, and the reasons why we are currently in this position.  Given that, the Court could not hand down another judgment relating to that without there being another wholesale finding of fact hearing, which everyone accepted would serve no purpose for the welfare of the children concerned.</span></p>

The father argues that this case gives clear evidence that such behaviour does happen, and is damaging for the children, and that would then create more discussion around solutions to provide better outcomes for children.  He also argues that the reality of his case is that there was not a better outcome for all of the children, notwithstanding the findings made, but that conclusion is also an important one that should be in the public interest and domain.</span></p>

The father submits that judgments such as the finding of fact judgment of March 2021 are helpful to the broader public in terms of increased knowledge of the workings of the family justice system. He points out that the judgment covers such matters as how the contested hearing was conducted, the legal principles applied in reaching a determination of the facts, the way in which the court considers any expert evidence, and the detailed consideration afforded to each allegation, which sets out the evidence, and an analysis of the evidence to reach an overall conclusion.

He suggested it offers examples where the parent with care could have intervened or responded differently to the behaviours exhibited by the children to prevent the hostility from becoming so entrenched. He suggests it also highlights how children may be affected and influenced by negative thoughts and feelings held by parents towards each other, or towards future blended families. He suggests that could aid separated parents in being more mindful of exposing their children to those aspects.</span></p>

I asked her to elaborate upon that, suggesting to her that given the findings I had made it did appear to me that this fell within that description.  She accepted that could be the court&#8217;s conclusion, but that the guardian considered that aspect was still possibly not clear. </span></p>

She suggested that for A simply knowing that they may come across this judgment, created an anxiety which may follow A through their studies, and the guardian was very concerned in relation to A&#8217;s emotional health.  I asked Ms Taylor given it would be fully anonymized, why that could have such an impact upon A, as I wanted to understand that aspect.  Ms Taylor told me that the anonymization does not change the reality that it is &#8216;out there&#8217;, and that for A simply the fact that it is the decision of a circuit judge and not of any authority did not assist.  The guardian&#8217;s view was that the views of the children should be given real weight by the court, and their strong position amounted to a compelling reason, particularly given the ages of the children.  </span></p>

For present purposes the decision of the House on the facts of Campbell and the differences between the majority and the minority are not material.  What does, however, emerge clearly from the opinions are four propositions.  First, neither article has as such precedence over the other.    Secondly, where  the  values  under  the  two  articles  are  in  conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific  rights  being  claimed  in  the  individual  case  is  necessary.    Thirdly, the  justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken  into account.  Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each.   For convenience I will call this the ultimate balancing test.  This is how I will approach the present case.</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">  (Lord Steyn)</span></p>

She suggests that the publication of the judgment would operate to be a permanent record hanging over the children&#8217;s heads.  I reject that as a valid factor. The judgment already exists and both parents have a copy of it.  The reason the judgment is critical of the mother is due to her behaviour and actions. In any event the children are fully aware that the judgment is negative of the mother&#8217;s actions.</span></p>

The parents made cross allegations against each other and I found that the mother&#8217;s actions were the substantial cause of the children&#8217;s difficulties in this case. In that situation the father is inevitably going to have some negative views of the mother.  Her actions set out in that judgment however were now mainly 3 or more years ago, and publication does not address both parents&#8217; views of each other now and the more recent events. I cannot see how publication would be permission to &#8216;hold onto&#8217; his feelings which in relation to those actions was justified. I am quite satisfied that nothing published now will change his views. </span></p>

In any event, these points do not go to the issue of publication, but rather to the children&#8217;s reaction to the judgment itself. </span></p>

I am told by the mother that A is an extremely private child, and it is asserted A would be horrified at any publication, they would view it as a betrayal of trust (by the father) and it would cause great emotional distress.  The mother asserts that A suffers with difficulties with anxiety and self confidence.  The mother may not be particularly objective in her views, however the guardian agrees, and also states that she is concerned about the distress and emotional impact.  I remind myself as I have set out above, of the strong words from the guardian that in her professional judgement, in relation to any publication, the emotional impact upon the children would be too great, and expresses concerns about the long and short term impact on the children&#8217;s emotional health.</span></p>

There are a variety of ways in which the children express some negative views of their father, and within this judgment I do not need to set them out in detail.  One of their complaints to the guardian however is that the father does not prioritise them, a view that the mother shares, and the father denies.  I have no doubt however that this is a genuine view of the children, and for them to know that the father, against their wishes, has supported the judgment being published, will certainly be damaging to their relationship. </span></p>

Neither of these rights has precedence over the other.

It is important in that judges do not just say they support transparency, but actually act upon that.  There is significant merit to the argument that only by a genuine cohort of judgments being published does a proper picture emerge of what takes place in the family courts.  I am very mindful of the importance of avoiding any suggestion that I or judges as a group simply give &#8216;lip service&#8217; to supporting and creating transparency, but do not actually publish judgments. As I have said above, I accept the fathers&#8217; arguments as being essentially valid and appropriate, and I must be careful to properly weigh that whilst considering the circumstances of this particular case. I also note the father&#8217;s right to &#8216;tell his story&#8217;, as set out in the Court of Appeal in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Tickle.</span></p>

Even with the judgment anonymised, the impact on the children has been clearly spelt out by the guardian.  The finding of fact judgment does of give a lengthy description of the life of the family, the history and actions of both the mother, the father and the children.  It must be true that anyone who knew details of this family, if they were shown that judgment, however carefully it was anonymised, would know and recognise the family. These children have endured years of court proceedings, as can be seen by the brief history I gave at the beginning.   I must scrutinise the views of the guardian carefully as to whether the impact on these children is any different than the impact upon many other families of anonymised publication. Given the history, I am sure it would have a far more significant impact than in the general run of cases.  </span></p>

However, in carrying out the Article 8/10 balance, the fact that publication will not merely harm the children&#8217;s emotional well being, but also harm their relationship with the other parent, is necessarily a very weighty consideration. </span></p>

It falls within para 16 of the guidance, and as I have decided not to publish the finding of fact hearing it is in the public interest this judgment is published which sets out the reasons for that. For the avoidance of doubt, the father has not made any application for this judgment to be published and in my view given there are no details within it that could identify the family.  Everything set out in this is known to the children and I have attempted to ensure it is focussed on the essential facts of the case sufficiently to allow it to be understood.  </span></p>
