In the alternative, if RYJ is determined to have capacity, LBL seeks to invoke the inherent jurisdiction of the court, initially seeking those orders commonly following decisions as to "best interests" of an incapacitated person and amounting to empowering the local authority to direct where she should reside, be educated and with whom she had contact and appointing the local authority to receive benefits payable to her.</span></p>

Apparently they now seek to preserve RYJ's position by way of recitals and preambles to an order ensuring that her decisions are facilitated and articulated with appropriate support.   No argument has been advanced by LBL asserting my jurisdiction to dismiss the mother as "appointee" for the purpose of receipt and management of benefits and appoint the local authority in her place in the face of the written arguments made by the OS and on behalf of VJ denying the same. I accept the latter arguments. The appointment of an "appointee" in this regard is in the discretion of the Secretary of State for Works and Pensions. (See below)</span></p>

VJ is well educated, obviously intelligent and articulate.   RYJ had medical problems from birth but a formal diagnosis of epilepsy and investigation of the extent of brain damage was delayed until at least 2001.  In January 2002 VJ suffered a mental breakdown.  RYJ was enrolled at the National Centre for Young People with Epilepsy (NCYPE) in Lingfield, Surrey as a boarder from 2003.   VJ withdrew RYJ from school in July 2008 concerned as to RYJ's physical welfare, the possibility that she had been victim of sexual abuse and her under achievement in basic literacy skills.  RYJ was then home educated for a year.  It is clear that the mother organised numerous extracurricular activities throughout.</span></p>

Difficulties became apparent in the relationship between mother and daughter.  RYJ was obviously resistant to weekend home leave and by the age of 15 is said by VJ to have become angry and physically aggressive towards her.   The police have been called to numerous incidents of domestic violence.   The mother has had recourse to a 'panic room' and button.   In addition VJ's pastor made known her concerns for the wellbeing of RYJ as a result of the difficult relationship between mother and daughter.   That relationship would, in my view, undoubtedly have suffered in consequence of their being in close and continuous proximity in the school year 2008/09.</span></p>

By his order on 30th July Moylan J declared in the interim that RYJ lacked capacity to litigate and make decisions regarding care, contact, residence, property and financial affairs and it was in her best interests to be accommodated in the summer holidays in accommodation provided by LBL and for the local authority to determine arrangements for care and contact taking into account RYJ's wishes and feelings.   The mother was prohibited from attending RYJ's vacation placement save for the purpose of supervised contact and a hearing listed for a review of contact between mother and daughter on 27th August.</span></p>

In this case the first test is undoubtedly met.   The second is in dispute.  Significantly, as I indicate below, I read the phrase "to a matter if at the material time he is unable to make a decision for himself in relation to the matter" in section 2 to mean that capacity is to be assessed in relation to the particular type of decision at the time the decision needs to be made and not the person's ability to make decisions generally or in abstract.   This, it appears to me, is an important distinction lost in the case of VJ and, to some extent, LBL.</span></p>

He is widely published and a Director of the British Neuropsychiatry Association. He is eminently qualified and experienced to be treated as an expert witness in the proceedings.  He visited RYJ at St. Mary's School on 1st July 2010 in the company of Stuart Sinclair, social worker.   At that time he also interviewed JB, lead nurse, and V O, speech and language therapist. The latter, in particular, he felt to have developed a particularly close knowledge of RYJ since her entry into the school.</span></p>

He has worked as a social worker since 1978 (as 'forensic social work manager' between 1988 and 1998 in a secure unit) and has a good knowledge of the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act.    He has practical experience of working with personality disordered patients and clients and is well informed on national resources and developments.    He has organised several national conferences on The Management of Personality Disorder as well as teaching and publishing of several articles in this subject.    He is regularly instructed to work on behalf of the Official Solicitor and practises as an independent social worker. He has acted in cases concerning children where 'adolescent issues' are the subject of investigation.</span></p>

For example, I was struck by the fact that Ms. Stevenson approached RYJ's 'inconsistency' as to contact with VJ in a particular and somewhat blinkered way.  It is clear that RYJ's answer "maybe" in response to a question  whether she wished to see VJ was interpreted to mean that, at worse &#8211; in terms of capacity-  she was unable to reach a decision on the matter or else, at best, frightened that her decision would not be given effect, not that she was at that stage undecided.   I accept the evidence of Mr Sinclair that it is necessary for those who deal with RYJ  not to underestimate her ability to attempt to manipulate a situation as with many other teenagers in similar stage of maturity and chronology age. At the time of this response RYJ was 'away' from her family living in somewhat isolated conditions.</span></p>

He considers that in such matters it was not unusual, given her chronological age, to anticipate that support would be needed to make such decisions and, as he commented, it is the rare and exceptional case when there can be said to be total knowledge as to future events.</span></p>

He makes the point that her present situation means that she is not being required to choose an education; rather, to choose whether she wants to move from her present establishment in which she receives an adequate education to another with a different emphasis.   I have no doubt  that RYJ would be unable to grapple with the more complex issues identified by the Statement of Educational Needs: for example, in the comparison of the merits of one to one teaching in another establishment and one to five teaching in her present establishment.    However, Dr Rickards and Mr. Sinclair agree that RYJ is obviously able to prioritise her happiness at her present state of affairs and, therefore, the emotional security which is provided to her by St. Mary's and thereby give credence to her decision to remain.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">There is one outstanding matter which I deal with which concerns the VJ's application to the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal concerning RYJ's future educational provision.    The consensus of Dr. Rickards, Mr. Sinclair and Ms. Stevenson (on behalf of LBL) is that RYJ's placement at St. Mary's is unequivocally benefiting her and is RYJ's clear and consistent choice of educational facility.   I question the ability of the Tribunal to make an order which deprives RYJ of that choice given my determination that she has capacity to determine whether or not she should remain in that establishment.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Looked at from the perspective of her 'best interests' it seems clear that the removal of RYJ against her will from that establishment would be entirely detrimental to her welfare, emotional and physical.   If the Tribunal maintains its jurisdiction to determine RYJ's placement regardless of her majority and capacity, then it seems to me appropriate that a copy of my approved judgment, transcribed at public expense, should be made available for its consideration.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Therefore, so far as this hearing is concerned, I determine that at this time R has capacity to make decisions about her care, contact and residence including the provision of education within the residential setting of St. Mary's, Bexhill-on-Sea.   I determine that the inherent jurisdiction is not invoked in the circumstances of this case and is not available to displace RYJ's autonomy in decisions relating to care, contact and residence including education.   The appointment of VJ to receive her benefits is reasonable and I do not seek by any means in this judgment to support her dismissal and substitution by another.  I merely reflect that any attempt to constrain RYJ's decisions reached appropriately should be regarded as good reason to replace VJ as appointee.</span></p>
