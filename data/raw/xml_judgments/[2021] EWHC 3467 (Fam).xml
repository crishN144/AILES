	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">This application concerns A who is nearly 3 years of age. On the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June 2020 her father (F) took her to Switzerland from the United Kingdom, without seeking her mother&#8217;s permission or informing her of his plans. It was an abduction and one which had been cynically and meticulously planned. F purported to be taking A for a walk, but he had in fact chartered a private flight to Switzerland with the contrivance of his own father who lives there. At that point in her life (aged 20 months) A&#8217;s mother (M) had been her primary carer. At the time she was abducted A was partly breast fed. The parents had recognised that their relationship had terminated and in June 2020, M believed that F was preparing to leave her home. She had been assisting him in locating alternative accommodation. </p>

It had a time estimate of 5 days. Unfortunately, the case had to be adjourned part-heard and resumed on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2021.

In my judgement that was calculated to maximise distress to M. It also signals controlling, manipulative behaviour. M immediately reported A&#8217;s abduction to the police. She contacted ICACU (International Child Abduction and Contact Unit) and commenced proceedings for A&#8217;s return pursuant to the 1980 Hague Convention. On 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2020 M&#8217;s 1980 Hague Convention application was dismissed by the Swiss court which found the Article 13b defence to be established. M launched an appeal, but this was ultimately unsuccessful. F had also commenced separate proceedings in the Swiss courts in which he sought urgent protective measures in respect of A, that application has since been dismissed. </p>

This is the third occasion in the last 6 months when I have received statements from parties in excess of 200 pages in international abduction cases. This is bad practice, it is counterproductive forensically, it is an entirely disproportionate exercise and where it is undertaken on behalf of a publicly funded client it is unlikely to be a proper charge on the legal aid certificate.</p>

I found Dr Black to be rather discursive in her analysis of the parent&#8217;s presentation. To the extent that Dr Black felt able to rely on either parent as an honest or accurate witness, I would not share her confidence. Dr Black&#8217;s report contains a great deal of self-report, from both parents. I consider both the parents to be, in different ways, unreliable and dishonest. Accordingly, self-report which is ultimately unchallenged is of little evidential benefit. However, much of what Dr Black says, resonates with my own impression of the parents as they gave evidence. </p>

I was struck by F&#8217;s lack of insight into his daughter&#8217;s needs and I saw no evidence at all of any real understanding of the impact of the abduction on A, both at the time and subsequently. I struggle to see how any adult who callously constructed an abduction of a child, in these circumstances, could have empathy for the child. This abduction requires to be identified for what it is, an act of cruelty to both the mother and the child. It is inconsistent with any healthy paternal instinct, knowingly to come between the baby and the breast in the way that F did.</p>

It is also important to be clear that whilst Dr Black did not consider that either parent had a personality disorder or major mental illness both, on objective psychometric assessment, revealed <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a degree of personality pathology in their functioning&#8221;.</span> Each parent, in Dr Black&#8217;s view, finds it <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;difficult to reflect upon their role&#8221;.</span> Both <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;appeared to significantly struggle to reflect upon the impact of their behaviour on both each other and their child&#8221;</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">TD filed a statement in these proceedings. In contrast to M&#8217;s account of the relationship, TD described it as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;very difficult&#8221;</span>. He told me how M travelled widely and was insufficiently attuned to her children&#8217;s physical and emotional needs. TD initially joined the family as an employed au pair to look after the children. He told me that he moved into the home in October 2010 and started a relationship with M in 2011. He described M as bullying and controlling in their relationship. In a manner which I consider to be diffident and embarrassed he told me how M had systematically isolated him from his family and friends. In contrast to the evidence of both M and F, I found TD&#8217;s evidence to be clear, consistent and compelling. It was littered with the hallmark of detail and delivered without any obvious rancour or malice. In my assessment TD is motivated by concern for the children, including the four older boys. TD described being financially exploited by M. He also recounts that when A was six months old, he seriously burnt his hand on the mesh of a gas heater that was left on beside the couple&#8217;s bed. This happened, he said, because M was on her phone and not supervising A properly. He described, in his statement, filed within these proceedings, that when she was in sole charge of the children M would leave S and A <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;in dirty nappies all day with a pile of soiled nappies in their bedroom&#8221;</span>.</p>

It also has the effect of signalling the integrity of TD&#8217;s concerns about the welfare of the children.</p>

TD contends that M still travelled abroad frequently at this stage. TD makes no suggestion that M deliberately hurt any of the children. He reasons that her preoccupation with her own life and interests caused her to fail <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;to give them sufficient attention&#8221;. </span>TD states that this is why <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;accidents would happen&#8221;</span>. In addition to the accident with the fire, TD describes a situation in June 2018 when A was locked in a room and got hold of a pair of scissors and cut his hair.

This order provided for contact with the mother on alternate weekends and some holidays. There were a number of alarming incidents in the years that followed, reinforcing TD&#8217;s concerns in respect of M&#8217;s inability consistently to give the children the attention they required, to promote their welfare and protect their safety. He recounts an occasion when S reported to him that he had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;almost drowned&#8221;</span> in a swimming pool in Spain, whilst in M&#8217;s care. M did not appear to dispute this, she told TD she was on her telephone when this happened, and he was saved by a stranger. Again, the episode reflects distraction and preoccupation with her own concerns on M&#8217;s behalf. </p>

A was permitted to sit in the front seat before he was old enough to do so. Even though TD pointed these matters out to M she did not attend to them. I reiterate, what is notable in TD&#8217;s account is that there is a level of detail in each of the allegations, which I find reinforces both their reliability and accuracy. I have already observed that the allegations each highlight a lack of attentive care by a distracted mother. If these were malicious allegations, as M suggests, they are advanced in language that is conspicuously free from malice. The language of TD&#8217;s complaints is, if anything, understated. I note that the allegations also resonate with Dr Black&#8217;s view of M&#8217;s tendency to develop <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;unending enthusiasms&#8221;</span> or preoccupations which preclude her from putting the children&#8217;s needs first.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">One of the central disputes in this case has been M&#8217;s developing &#8220;enthusiasm&#8221; for Judaism. Though she is not Jewish she dresses in a broadly orthodox style, is attentive to the Levitical rigours of diet and observes significant holy days. Her developing preoccupation had been registered by TD and, correctly in my judgement, perceived by him as placing an unhealthy burden on the children. Following weekends with their mother the boys would tell TD that M had told them that they should undergo circumcision. The boys had been led to understand that this was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;what a good Christian would do&#8221;</span>. TD said the boys talked about it constantly. They told him that M had said that if they didn&#8217;t agree to the circumcision, she would not see them. They also told their father that they had been told that they would <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;burn in the eternal flames of hell&#8221;</span>. TD confronted M with this, he was plainly disturbed that M was frightening the boys and behaving completely inappropriately. He told me it had no impact. I formed a clear impression that he was afforded very little respect by M. In the witness box I sensed that TD was struggling to understand how it was that he had become so victimised in this relationship. I had a very clear impression of a man who had struggled and was still struggling to assert his own autonomy. What is entirely clear is that he was totally opposed to the boys being circumcised and objected to it in language that left no room at all for any doubt about his position. </p>

On that day she took the children to a Dr Spitzer<span style="color:#FF0000"/>to be circumcised. She did this in a deliberately clandestine manner. TD only found out later from the children themselves. He described the boys as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;having had a hugely traumatic experience&#8221;</span>. This was picked up through the social services and psychological assessment. The headteacher proposed play therapy and counselling for S. As TD said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;not only did [M] fail to show any insight into the effect of her actions on to the children, she refused to consent to the therapy to take place&#8221;.</span> Fortunately, social services intervened to ensure the therapy went ahead. TD told me he considered that M has never felt any regret for her actions. Again, I accept TD&#8217;s evidence, moreover, I agree with his assessment. In simple terms, in M&#8217;s eyes, the boys being circumcised makes them more acceptably Jewish. The distortion implicit of such thinking requires no further analysis. </p>

That evening TD told me that M texted him asking <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;did you like the surprise?&#8221;.</span> I accept the text was sent and that it referred to the circumcision. F had already discovered the boys were circumcised. S was in pain at school that day and had quickly told his father about it. There is, to my mind, a symmetry here between F&#8217;s careful contrived cruelty to M and her own cruelty to TD. The propensity for this couple i.e. M and F to behave in similarly distorted ways was, I consider, astutely identified by Dr Black. </p>

As will be clear from the above, I have no hesitation in making that finding but it is a tepid and unsatisfactory reflection of the finding that requires to be made. This mother violated the personal and bodily integrity of her two boys. She did so in a planned way, deliberately concealing her actions from the boy&#8217;s father and following a period of coercion where she knowingly frightened the boys with fear of the &#8216;flames of hell&#8217; and the withdrawal of her own affection. With no apology for the repetition, it requires to be said that calculated parental behaviour of this kind is of comparable magnitude to the abduction of <span style="color:#000000">A</span> by F.</p>

Mr Gration invites me to say that M was credible and believable. With respect to him, I do not consider that to be a sustainable submission. As I have said where the evidence of TD conflicts with M and for the reasons I have analysed, I have little difficulty in preferring the evidence of TD. His honesty as a witness cast in to sharp focus the inherent unreliability of both M and F. The extensive contact M now has with the boys will in part be due to the efforts of extensive social work input but it is a great tribute to TD that he has been able to foster and revive the &#8216;boys&#8217; relationship with their mother after what she has done. I am afraid I disagree with Mr Edwards submission that M is genuinely <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;reflective and able to accept what she had done was wrong&#8221;</span>.

It was obvious to me that he loves his mother. He had a smiling and a happy disposition. He aligned himself with his mother&#8217;s views. He told me that he had his kippah in his brief case with him at court. He identifies as Jewish, though he is not. He too was circumcised in his teenage years, but he believes this to have been his own choice. He told me that he prays regularly and is fond of a local Rabbi. I noticed in the course of his evidence that Z appeared malleable, yielding easily to counsel&#8217;s suggestions and perplexed when they confronted his perception of the world. I also observed that M was very proud of him and, within the constraints of the court room situation, they appeared happy and relaxed in each other&#8217;s company. Z spoke movingly of his sister. He feels a real grief in the separation. I feel sure that reflects the view of the whole family and it signals to me that whilst there are undoubtedly very troubling facets to M&#8217;s parenting, she nonetheless generates an atmosphere in which there is much love and fun. The significant harm she caused S and A has also to be measured against this more positive side of her personality. It strikes me that this is the balance that TD struck when he was able, ultimately, to promote unsupervised contact. </p>

Mr Gration submits that TD and F have <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;teamed up&#8221;</span> as I understand it, falsely to traduce M. In my judgement it is far more subtle than that. I consider that F, who I find to be highly manipulative, has approached TD and taken from him what I find to be his true account of his relationship with M. F has purloined this account and adopted it. I find the dynamic of M and F&#8217;s relationship to have been entirely different.

He cannot or will not acknowledge the harm that he has done to her. He has no plan as to how to remedy that harm in the future, including by way of facilitating proper contact between [A], her mother and her siblings. There is nothing to suggest that the father has sufficient insight into his actions to ameliorate the harm that he has caused. For so long as [A] remains in his care, she is extremely unlikely to have any direct relationship with her mother.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Again, I agree. Indeed, I would go further, I consider F to be entirely ill equipped to ameliorate the harm that he has caused to his daughter. He lacks both the insight and the motivation to do so. I consider that this abduction, unlike most of such cases that the court hears, was not solely motivated by a desperate desire to care for a child but also by an intention deliberately to hurt the other parent. Mr Gration observed that given what F has said about his future intentions, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;it is perhaps surprising that he has engaged in these proceedings at all&#8221;</span>. Though I draw back from any firm conclusion I have, on a number of occasions, found myself wondering whether F has participated in these proceedings, merely or at least in part deliberately to cause further pain to M.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">As will be plain from the above analysis, I reject F&#8217;s account of himself as a victim of bullying behaviour by M and, accordingly, his assertion that he abducted A as a last resort to protect both himself and her. This was a cold and meticulously contrived abduction which required a great deal of careful planning. It not only separated A from her mother but from her siblings too. I am told that she is brought up to speak French which her mother does not speak. She is entirely deracinated from her maternal family with no recognition by F of the extent to which that will cause her lifelong harm and, ultimately, come to corrode her relationship with him too. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I have already indicated that I consider Ms Odze failed to give sufficient weight to some of M&#8217;s behaviour in the way that I have emphasised above. However, the balance of harm she identifies is not, in my judgement, ultimately displaced by this significant omission. Ms Odze considers that though she becomes distracted by her various preoccupations, M loves her children deeply and instinctively. This is not an instinct she sees in F. Further, the separation of A from her mother and siblings is, she correctly emphasises, to be interpreted as significant ongoing harm, entirely inimical to A&#8217;s best interests. In the present situation it is impossible to identify, on a true analysis, any amelioration of this ongoing harm. In contrast M&#8217;s identified failings are capable of being tempered by ongoing support. This has already been established by the reintroduction of her relationship with S and Z and her ongoing relationship with the older boys. Additionally, it requires to be noted, as Ms Odze emphasises, that M has been able, historically, to engage in therapy and remains committed to do so.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The harm that Ms Odze identifies to A is, manifestly, significant. It strikes to the core of her identity and, as she says, is likely to impact on her psychologically, especially in her adolescence and young adult hood. I agree with this analysis and I also agree with Mr Gration&#8217;s submission that this identified harm can only be addressed by A&#8217;s return to the UK. F is either unwilling or potentially unable (in the sense that he does not recognise it) to address it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr McWatters, on behalf of F, submits that the court should resist the temptation to punish F for the abduction and focus, unwaveringly, on A&#8217;s best interests. That is an important point to make and I have borne it in mind throughout, as is clear from my analysis above. However, for all the reasons I have set out, I consider that the circumstances of A&#8217;s abduction, F&#8217;s identified psychological functioning, his inability to understand the impact on A of both the abduction and ongoing separation, all point to a very significant deficit in his ability to comprehend where his daughter&#8217;s best interests lie. F&#8217;s account of himself as a victim of M&#8217;s controlling or coercive behaviour I have found to be entirely false. Whilst this relationship is essentially toxic and in which both parties have, I am sure, behaved reprehensibly to each other, I am clear that F is not a victim. Accordingly, the account to the Swiss Authorities is entirely fallacious and as they have been unable to assess its reliability will inevitably have impeded their capacity to survey the wider canvas illuminating A&#8217;s best welfare interests. The most obvious consequence of F&#8217;s false account was to require M&#8217;s contact with A to be supervised to a degree which has proved to be unworkable and effectively made contact impossible for her. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Mr McWatters further submits that F would not be able to return to the UK if I ordered A&#8217;s return. It is contended that F would likely be arrested and charged with criminal offences, in respect of which a significant custodial sentence would almost certainly be imposed, upon conviction. This may well be true, but it nonetheless leaves a degree of choice with F as to how he chooses to respond. M, by contrast, and even against the backdrop of this disturbing history, remains, I find, genuinely and instinctively aware of the importance to A of some knowledge of and relationship with her father. F, in so far as he is able to articulate these principles at all, does so entirely unconvincingly. This is notwithstanding that he is otherwise an articulate man. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Ms Odze suggested, in her oral evidence, that M might wish to give an undertaking not to cooperate with any prosecution of F. In international abduction cases such undertakings are quite regularly given. However, in this case M has shown no inclination to do so and, as I intimated during the course of her evidence, I did not think that here, it was appropriate for Ms Odze, as the child&#8217;s Guardian, to raise it. Though I am certain Ms Odze would not have intended it, it might nonetheless have had a coercive impact. Ultimately, I went further and indicated that I was not prepared to accept such an undertaking. I do not consider that the High Court should effectively obstruct the administration of the criminal justice system, particularly in the face of such callous and clear criminality. Moreover, I would regard such an undertaking as unenforceable and for that reason alone, inappropriate. </p>

In principle, the approach in private family proceedings between parents should be the same as the approach in care proceedings. However, there are specific risks to which the court must be alive. Allegations of abuse are not being made by a neutral and expert local authority which has nothing to gain by making them, but by a parent who is seeking to gain an advantage in the battle against the other parent. This does not mean that they are false but it does increase the risk of misinterpretation, exaggeration or downright fabrication. On the other hand, the child will not routinely have the protection and support of a Cafcass guardian. There are also many more litigants in person in private proceedings. So if the court does reach the conclusion that justice cannot be done unless the child gives evidence, it will have to take very careful precautions to ensure that the child is not harmed by this.&#8221;</span></p>

F is simply not committed to promoting these crucial facets of A&#8217;s fundamental rights.

It is also clear that the involvement of Social Services, in the past, has been generally beneficial to her practical parenting and that she remains receptive to working openly with them in the future.
