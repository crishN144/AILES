	    <p style="margin-left:0.81in;margin-right:0.28in">The factual background upon which the judicial review and family proceedings are established can be shortly stated.  TT&#8217;s registered gender at birth was &#8220;female&#8221;.  TT has been diagnosed as gender dysphoric and for many years he has lived as a transgender male.  TT&#8217;s transition was assisted and supported by regular hormone treatment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.81in;margin-right:0.28in">For some years it has been TT&#8217;s hope that he would become the biological parent of a child.  In 2016 TT took professional advice and, thereafter, he engaged treatment at a fertility clinic registered to provide &#8220;treatment services&#8221; under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 [&#8216;HFEA 2008&#8217;].  His hormone treatment was suspended, his menstrual cycle recommenced and in due course, in 2017 he was artificially inseminated by inter-uterine insemination (&#8216;IUI&#8217;) using donor sperm.  Conception was achieved, and, in due time, TT gave birth to a child, YY. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.81in;margin-right:0.28in">Under the guidance of an endocrinologist, TT had paused his hormone treatment.  Thereafter, and before attending the fertility clinic for IUI treatment, TT had applied for a Gender Recognition certificate which, when granted, would confirm for all purposes, his acquired gender as male under the Gender Recognition Act 2004 [&#8216;GRA 2004&#8217;].  In support of his application to the Gender Recognition Panel TT made a declaration, as required by GRA 2004, s 3 that it was his intention to live in the gender of male for the rest of his life.  The application was also supported by medical evidence confirming the diagnosis of gender dysphoria.   </p>

The Claimant did not disclose to the GR Panel the fact that he had paused therapy or that he was actively seeking IUI treatment with a view to becoming pregnant. Such information was not specifically requested as part of the GR certificate application. Instead, the Claimant was required to prove that he had been living for two years as a male.  In this respect the Claimant relied upon the fact that he had transitioned to male, and had also changed all of his identification documents, a number of years earlier. </p>

Having explained the factual background to the Registrar, TT insisted that he should be registered as YY&#8217;s &#8220;father&#8221;.  The Registrar declined his request and advised that TT could only be registered as YY&#8217;s &#8220;mother&#8221;. </p>

His primary claim is for a declaration that, as a matter of domestic law, he is indeed to be regarded as the &#8220;father&#8221;.  His secondary position is that, if not &#8220;father&#8221;, his child&#8217;s birth certificate should simply record his status in gender neutral terms as &#8220;parent&#8221;.  TT&#8217;s alternative case is that, in the event that the court concludes that domestic law requires that he be registered as &#8220;mother&#8221;, that outcome would be a breach of both TT&#8217;s and YY&#8217;s rights under European Convention on Human Rights, Article 8 so as to justify the court making a declaration of incompatibility under Human Rights Act 1998, s 4. </p>

Having been told that the film was due to receive its world premiere at a film festival in New York in the coming weeks, and that that date would coincide with the publication in the UK of an article in a national newspaper describing TT as a transgender male who had given birth, TT&#8217;s lawyers quite properly informed the court and the other parties of this new information. </p>

There is legitimate public interest, as TT plainly accepts by his participation in the film and the article, in his journey through pregnancy to parenthood.  Equally, it is contended, there is public interest in the question of how the state and the law should recognise TT&#8217;s parenthood as &#8220;mother&#8221; or &#8220;father&#8221; or &#8220;parent&#8221; as demonstrated by the media reports of the current proceedings.

The test which has been applied in answering it is whether the public interest served by publishing the facts extended to publishing the name. In practice, where the court is satisfied that there is a real public interest in publication, that interest has generally extended to publication of the name. This is because the anonymised reporting of issues of legitimate public concern are less likely to interest the public and therefore to provoke discussion.

And this is why, of course, even when reporting major disasters, journalists usually look for a story about how particular individuals are affected. Writing stories which capture the attention of readers is a matter of reporting technique, and the European court holds that article 10 protects not only the substance of ideas and information but also the form in which they are conveyed: <span style="font-style:italic">News Verlags GmbH &amp; Co KG v Austria</span><span> </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">(2001) 31 EHRR 8</span>, 256, para 39 </p>

This is not just a matter of deference to editorial independence. The judges are recognising that editors know best how to present material in a way that will interest the readers of their particular publication and so help them to absorb the information. A requirement to report it in some austere, abstract form, devoid of much of its human interest, could well mean that the report would not be read and the information would not be passed on. Ultimately, such an approach could threaten the viability of newspapers and magazines, which can only inform the public if they attract enough readers and make enough money to survive.&#8221; </p>

First, not only are the children&#8217;s interests likely to be affected by a breach of the privacy interests of their parents, but the children have independent privacy interests of their own. They also have a right to respect for their family life with their parents. Secondly, by [HRA 1997] s 12(4)(b), any court considering whether to grant either an interim or a permanent injunction has to have &#8220;particular regard&#8221; to &#8220;any relevant privacy code&#8221;. It is not disputed that the Independent Press Standards Organisation Editors&#8217; Code of Practice, which came into force in January, is a relevant Code for this purpose. This, as Lord Mance JSC has explained, at para 36, provides that &#8220;editors must demonstrate an exceptional public interest to over-ride the normally paramount interests of children under 16&#8221;. </p>

At present, there is no evidence about this. It is possible that, at trial, the evidence will not support any risk of harm to the children&#8217;s interests from publication of the story in the English print and broadcasting media. It is possible that the evidence will indicate that the children can be protected from any such risk, by a combination of the efforts of their parents, teachers and others who look after them and some voluntary restraint on the part of the media. </p>

There is all the difference in the world between the sort of wall to wall publicity and intrusion which is likely to meet the lifting of this injunction and their learning this information in due course, which the Court of Appeal thought inevitable. For one thing, the least harmful way for these children to learn of these events is from their parents. Their parents have the resources to take wise professional advice about how to reveal and explain matters to their children in an age-appropriate way and at the age-appropriate time. No doubt their parents are already giving careful thought to whether this might be the best way of protecting their children, especially from the spike of interest which is bound to result from this judgment let alone from any future judgment. The particular features which are relevant to the balancing exercise in this case are contained in three short paragraphs in the unredacted version of this judgment. These unfortunately have to be redacted because it would be comparatively easy to surmise the identity of the children and their parents from them. There are particular reasons why care should be taken about how, when and why these children should learn the truth.&#8217; </p>

It is there to reassure the public and the parties that our courts are indeed doing justice according to law. In fact, there are two aspects to this principle. The first is that justice should be done in open court, so that the people interested in the case, the wider public and the media can know what is going on. The court should not hear and take into account evidence and arguments that they have not heard or seen. The second is that the names of the people whose cases are being decided, and others involved in the hearing, should be public knowledge. The rationale for the second rule is not quite the same as the rationale for the first, as we shall see. This case is about the second rule. There is a long-standing practice that certain classes of people, principally children and mental patients, should not be named in proceedings about their care, treatment and property. The first issue before us is whether there should be a presumption of anonymity in civil proceedings, or certain kinds of civil proceedings, in the High Court relating to a patient detained in a psychiatric hospital, or otherwise subject to compulsory powers, under the Mental Health Act 1983 (&#8220;the 1983 Act&#8221;). The second issue is whether there should be an anonymity order on the facts of this particular case. </p>

The quotation is taken from para 20 of the speech of Baroness Hale of Richmond JSC, with whom Lord Brown of Eaton-underHeywood and Lord Mance JJSC agreed, in <span style="font-style:italic">ZG (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2011] 2 WLR 148, which was a case concerned with the weight to be given to the best interests of children who are affected by the decision of the Home Secretary to remove or deport one or both of their parents from this country, more specifically with the question: in what circumstances is it permissible to remove or deport a non-citizen parent (here the mother whose immigration history was described as &#8220;appalling&#8221;) where the effect will be that a child who is a citizen of the United Kingdom will also have to leave?  I appreciate that the issue is far removed from that with which this Court is concerned but since the interests of the appellant&#8217;s children are undoubtedly engaged, the universal principles cannot be ignored. The proper approach is, therefore, neatly summarised by Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore JSC, at para 46 of that decision, namely: </p>

This is not, it is agreed, a factor of limitless importance in the sense that it will prevail over all considerations. It is a factor, however, that must rank higher than any other. It is not merely one consideration that weighs in the balance alongside other competing factors. Where the best interests of the child clearly favour a certain course, that course should be followed, unless countervailing reasons of considerable force displace them. It is not necessary to express this in terms of a presumption but the primacy of this consideration needs to be made clear in emphatic terms. What is determined to be in a child&#8217;s best interests should customarily dictate the outcome of cases such as the present, therefore, and it will require considerations of substantial moment to permit a different result.&#8221; </p>

It is clear that the interests of children do not automatically take precedence over the Convention rights of others. It is clear also that, when in a case such as this the court is deciding where the balance lies between the article 10 rights of the media and the Article 8 rights of those whose privacy would be invaded by publication, it should accord particular weight to the Article 8 rights of any children likely to be affected by the publication, if that would be likely to harm their interests. Where a tangible and objective public interest tends to favour publication, the balance may be difficult to strike. The force of the public interest will be highly material, and the interests of affected children cannot be treated as a trump card.&#8217; </p>

If PJS&#8217;s case was simply based on confidentiality (or secrecy), then, while I would not characterise his claim for a permanent injunction as hopeless, it would have substantial difficulties. The publication of the story in newspapers in the United States, Canada, and even in Scotland would not, I think, be sufficient of itself to undermine the claim for a permanent injunction on the ground of privacy. However, the consequential publication of the story on websites, in tweets and other forms of social network, coupled with consequential oral communications, has clearly resulted in many people in England and Wales knowing at least some details of the story, including the identity of PJS, and many others knowing how to get access to the story. There are claims that between 20% and 25% of the population know who PJS is, which, it is fair to say, suggests that at least 75% of the population do not know the identity of PJS, and presumably more than 75% do not know much if anything about the details of the story. However, there comes a point where it is simply unrealistic for a court to stop a story being published in a national newspaper on the ground of confidentiality, and, on the current state of the evidence, I would, I think, accept that, if one was solely concerned with confidentiality, that point had indeed been passed in this case. </p>

If in all other respects the media case is made out with respect to greater openness in the judicial review proceedings, there is no separate justification of any weight to hold that the existence of the family proceedings should prevent the court from granting the Media Groups&#8217; application. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Returning to the case as a whole, Mr de Wilde submitted that the publication of the film and the article has radically changed the nature of the information that has hitherto been protected by the anonymity injunction.  This is partly because this degree of publicity, which has been self-generated by TT, now falls to be considered within the Article 8 evaluation that the court must undertake within the judicial review proceedings.  More widely, the only information that is now protected by the injunction simply relates to the fact that TT is the Claimant before the court.  Whilst the situation might have been different had there been no subsequent publicity, an argument in favour of privacy can no longer be sustained.  In the ordinary course of judicial review proceedings, a person&#8217;s identity as a party to those proceedings does not attract a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Where that individual has put the very information that might otherwise be said to be private directly into the public domain, then that information should no longer be treated as private. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Insofar as TT seeks to maintain a distinction between the film and, separately, publicity about these proceedings, by identifying the high degree of editorial control that he maintained over the production of the documentary and the article, Mr de Wilde submits that that distinction falls away once the film is broadcast.  Thereafter the film, in just the same way as the court proceedings, will fall to be the subject of legitimate comment, which may or may not be favourable, but which will certainly be outside TT&#8217;s control. </p>

If matters were to escalate, then Mr de Wilde points to various means of protection under the law and via the Editors&#8217; Code of Practice that could be deployed to protect TT&#8217;s interests. </p>

With the advantage of the perspective of being the judge in the proceedings, I am clear that there can be no basis for holding that TT acted deliberately to mislead the court.

Knowledge of the content of the film is relatively transient, whereas being the first transgender man to seek to establish his status as &#8220;father&#8221; is a state of affairs, once it is in the public domain, that will endure.  The degree of adverse comment generated by the anonymous account of the judicial review proceedings thus far is striking.  It was, it is submitted, in part generated by a sarcastic and insensitive tone of the article that appeared in The MailOnline site.  We live in a time when some members of society are strongly antagonistic against transgender individuals.  On the day of the hearing of this application the police had announced that the number of reported transgender hate crimes had risen by 86% in the past four years.  It is, submitted Ms Evans, the business of the Press to sensationalise stories.  The potential for greater sensationalism than will result simply from broadcast of the film is plain as it would be tied to the result of these proceedings, whatever that is, coupled with the broadcast of the film; the result will therefore be cumulative. </p>

But that distinction does not compare like with like.  Whilst the fact that there was a film, or its contents might fade, the information at the core of the film, namely that TT is a transgender male who has given birth, will not and that information is very much of the same order as the fact that TT is the Claimant in this case.  In terms of the durability of the information in the public memory, or the memory of those who know or may encounter TT, if there is a distinction to be drawn between that which is currently public and that which is not, it is, in my view, a distinction without a significant difference, or, to use Mr de Wilde&#8217;s word, artificial.  </p>

It was TT who decided to seek IUI treatment whilst living as a man.  It was he who decided to apply, during the same time-period, for a Gender Recognition Certificate. It was he who was involved in the commissioning and production of the documentary which was filmed, with his full cooperation, over the three years culminating in YY&#8217;s birth. It was he who sought to be registered as YY&#8217;s &#8216;father&#8217; and, when that was refused, it was he who issued judicial review proceedings.  Subsequently, it has been TT who consented to, and cooperated with the publication of the newspaper article naming him and carrying a portrait photograph of him.  The documentary film has already been shown at bespoke venues abroad and in the UK and there is no indication that TT intends to take any step to prevent the broadcast of the film on national television. </p>

The paradigm case on intrusion is one where information which would otherwise be confidential, has come into the hands of others and, by some means, has entered the public domain and is at risk of further publicity. TT&#8217;s actions have established firstly a situation where it is public knowledge, that TT is a transgender man who has given birth to a child, and secondly a situation where the public know that an anonymous claimant, in exactly the same, very rare, set of circumstances, has applied to be afforded the status of &#8216;father&#8217; under the law with respect to that child. </p>

As a matter of both fact and law, the circumstances of TT&#8217;s claim are novel.  The issue raised in the proceedings has not apparently been determined by any court either in this jurisdiction or elsewhere in the Western world.  The issue has not been directly addressed by Parliament.  As the comments from the online commentariat have demonstrated, not all citizens share the same view as TT on how the law should record his status with respect to his child.  This is therefore a case, to echo Lord Sumption&#8217;s words, in which there is a real public interest in publication and, as a result, this should normally extend to the publication of the Claimant&#8217;s name. </p>

Whilst his identity as the Claimant in this case is not currently public, the fact that he is the Claimant is, in reality, all part of a piece with that which is already known and with the fact that he has made a film about his experience and has sought to publicise that film.  The degree to which his privacy will be compromised by revealing this additional information, whilst not at the &#8216;most minimal&#8217; level argued for by the Media Groups, is not great.  If, which has not been established, TT experiences direct harassment or media behaviour which contravenes the law or the Editors&#8217; Code, as a result of identifying him as the Claimant, steps are available to provide him with a measure of protection.  </p>

Indeed, in the present case, having seen the film, which is an impressive and wholly sympathetic documentation of TT&#8217;s experience in the very process that has led to this application, I consider that the public interest will genuinely be enhanced by directly linking his identity as the subject of the film with his role as the Claimant in this case which seeks to establish the consequence, in terms of law and status, of that which the film records. </p>

YY&#8217;s best interests are a primary, but not determinative, consideration.  At the main hearing the court had advice from the retired CAFCASS guardian who is acting as YY&#8217;s litigation friend to the effect that it was not in the child&#8217;s best interests for knowledge that he was born to a transgender male to be disclosed publicly. </p>

The baseline that existed when YY&#8217;s litigation friend proffered her advice to the court has therefore shifted and, for better or for worse, the prospect of YY growing up in circumstances where those who know him do not know that the parent who gave birth to him is a transgender male is now probably remote. </p>

In this regard, YY&#8217;s age is plainly relevant. He will not, therefore have any direct knowledge of any publicity, let alone its content, that may be generated by these proceedings when judgment is handed down in the coming month or months.  If there is an appeal process, and even if that process runs up through the domestic courts and on to Strasbourg, he is still likely to be very young when it concludes. The potential for immediate and direct harm to YY from any publicity and comment arising from publishing material around the court proceedings that identifies TT is currently effectively zero and even allowing for an appeal process is low.  This is in contrast, for example, to the position of the children in <span style="font-style:italic">PJS</span>, as described by Baroness Hale at paragraph 74, who would learn distressing information directly from wall to wall publicity and intrusion of the sort that would have followed lifting the injunction in that case. </p>

The playground is, as Ward LJ rightly observed, a cruel place and, if he is known to be a child born to a transgender male, it is most unlikely that this information will not be used to YY&#8217;s detriment at some time.  The question that is at the heart of this part of the case is whether such unwelcome attention or bullying will arise because of the identification of YY as being the subject of this claim by TT to be registered as his &#8216;father&#8217;, or whether it would arise in any event because of knowledge of his circumstances that are known and will become better known through the film.  In this regard, and with respect to YY&#8217;s circumstances, I do not accept that the fact that he was the subject of a legal dispute as to the status of his parent significantly elevates the potential or level of harm above that which may follow the more general knowledge of the circumstances of his conception and birth. </p>

Throughout the film, TT candidly and bravely describes his feelings and the experience of undertaking the treatment process.  This material is in the public domain and will be more generally seen when the film is broadcast.  From the perspective of YY, filming of the moment and process of his conception, and filming of his birth, is filming of material that is of a high order of intimacy and privacy, yet the film has been shown to the public and is to be broadcast on national television. It is, therefore, difficult to understand how being known as the child who was also the subject of these judicial review proceedings is likely to increase any detriment to YY&#8217;s Art 8 rights given the quality of the material which is already in the public domain. </p>

Those who know TT, and learn that he is the Claimant in this case, are also likely to know YY and thus, indirectly, he will be identified as the child who is the subject of this claim. For reasons that I have already given, I regard this degree of intrusion as at a low level so far as YY is concerned. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Despite affording priority to YY&#8217;s best interests, I consider that the additional intrusion into his right to privacy and family life, over and above that which will follow from the existing publicity, is not so significant as to justify maintaining anonymity.  In reaching that conclusion as to significance I have, as I have explained, paid particular regard to two factors: firstly, YY&#8217;s age and the fact that any direct impact on him is likely to be felt some years hence when the detail of the court case, as opposed to knowledge of the underlying biological facts, will have faded, and, secondly, that knowledge that he was the subject of this legal challenge is unlikely to add significantly to that which is, or will be, already known about him as a result of </p>
