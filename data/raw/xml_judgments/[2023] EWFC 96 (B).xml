The mother moved to the UK in 2005 and then moved London in 2013. The parents met in April 2014 and very quickly decided to get married. It seems that neither of their wider families were supportive of this relationship. The parties nevertheless married Islamically in August 2014 and lived together. The marriage was legalised in October 2015 at a registry office. In the summer of 2016, the father&#8217;s immigration visa was amended to a visa as a family member of an EU national. The mother discovered that she was pregnant with A in October 2016. The pregnancy and labour were difficult, with A born by emergency caesarean section. The mother reports that the accommodation that the family were living in at that time was poor and unhygienic. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In September 2017, the mother took A to Poland for the first time and while there, sought medical attention due to some concerns about her veins following her pregnancy, which required surgery The mother returned in October 2017 but then returned to Poland again where she planned to have the surgery. She says that the father was not supportive of her during this time and did not want her to use their money to pay for surgery.  The mother says that due to A then becoming unwell and being hospitalised, the surgery did not actually take place as planned in any event. A then underwent some medical examinations, which concluded that she had low muscle tone, linked to problems with her muscular and skeletal systems. She would require physiotherapy and paediatric care when the family returned to the UK. The father then visited Poland in December 2017 before returning to the UK, with the mother and A returning later on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2017. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In October 2018, the Local Authority became involved following concerns raised by the mother that A may have been sexually assaulted by a member of the paternal family, while also reporting that she felt emotionally abused, financially controlled and generally undermined by the father. The father denied that A had been sexually abused and denied the allegations made by the mother against him. The Local Authority commenced an assessment in respect of A, and she was the subject of a Child Protection medical. The outcome of this was that there was no evidence of A having been sexually assaulted and the Local Authority&#8217;s involvement was brought to an end. Although no further action was taken, the mother did remain concerned about A&#8217;s presentation. For the avoidance of doubt, A has no contact with the member of the paternal family who was accused of assaulting her. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems that, following the separation, the father&#8217;s time with A was not consistent, although the parents each give differing explanations for this. It does however seem clear that the father spent some extended periods of time away from the UK between the end of the parent&#8217;s relationship and March 2022, although there seems to be some disagreement between the parties as to how often and for how long the father was away for. It is also right to note that the mother and A have continued to travel to Poland regularly since A&#8217;s birth, including a long stay around the time of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and for shorter periods at other times. A is clearly very much familiar with visiting her maternal family in Poland. </p>

The mother says that A will have the opportunity to further develop her relationship with her extended maternal family and they will be able to support the mother in caring for A, which is something she says that she lacks in the UK, where she often feels isolated, particularly when the father has travelled abroad. The mother has no family in the UK and says that she has a limited network of friends, with her closest friends living around five hours away. The mother says that she has found a good school for A, which has a vacancy in September 2023, and where there is a focus on teaching English, which will enable A to retain and improve her English language skills.&#160;The mother says that there will be very many opportunities for A to visit new places and to participate in a wide range of different activities in Poland, which she feels A will very much enjoy and benefit from. </span></p>

She accepts that contact has been taking place at least twice a week since June 2022, on Fridays and Sundays for at least three hours on each occasion, with additional contact being agreed between the parties. There have also been regular video calls, mostly initiated by A. The mother fully accepts that contact is a positive experience for A. She said that she really looks forward to and enjoys the time she spends with her father, and it is clear that the mother regards it as important for A to maintain this relationship. She told me how she encourages A to celebrate important dates in the father's culture and religion, such as when all three of them went out for dinner together to celebrate Eid. The mother, however, does that feel that a move to Poland is necessarily a barrier to this relationship continuing. She says that she has offered generous contact by travelling to the UK with A on alternate months, so six times a year, for A to see her father. This will be at weekends but with additional time in the school holidays and on Polish bank holidays. The mother has also suggested that the father travels to Poland at least three times a year to see A, and the mother has offered to pay half of his reasonable travel costs for such trips. Additionally, the mother has offered her agreement to the father reducing his monthly maintenance payments from &#163;200 to &#163;100 a month to assist him in funding these trips. While to mother accepts that the frequency of contact will inevitably reduce, she was of the view that the quality may improve under her proposals. If the father secures more suitable accommodation, the mother fully supports contact taking place overnight, which may mean that the total number of hours that A spends with her father in a year would not actually reduce very much from what it is now, although the frequency of the contact clearly will. </span></p>

The mother is however still concerned that the father might relocate outside of the jurisdiction permanently, either to Pakistan, where his family are building a house, or to Canada, where the father has previously told the mother that he might relocate to. In the mother&#8217;s view, any such relocation would make contact very difficult between the father and A, as well as leaving the mother and A isolated in the UK again.

She has a job offer there and accommodation that will be arranged and funded by the maternal grandparents. The accommodation is suitable and appropriate for the mother and A to live in and is likely to be of a better standard to the accommodation than they currently live it. It is likely that A will benefit from her mother being in a stronger financial position and may mean that A can experience activities and trips that she cannot experience in the UK. Having said that, it should not be suggested that A has a poor quality of life in the UK. Her father works and contributes &#163;200 a month towards her care, and I have heard in evidence from both parents that A enjoys many activities such as going to the cinema, to the park, swimming, visiting play centres and going out for dinner. While I accept that the mother is not in a strong financial position, she is clearly providing for A, with some support from the father, to a good standard. </p>

The mother says, and I accept, that she has a limited support network in the UK. She has some friends, although it appears they live many miles and hours away. She has no family here. The mother has made the point that when the father has previously been abroad, she has been left with no support network. There is no doubt that the mother would have a greater support network in Poland to assist her in caring for A and I accept that A would benefit from spending increased time with her maternal family members, particularly her grandparents who she is clearly already close to, while there are many other family members and friends that she will develop her relationships with further. If A remains in the UK, there is an expectation on the father that he will remain a consistent figure in A&#8217;s life and will be able to support the mother, both financially and practically, in looking after A as he has done for the past twelve months. </p>

She is doing well there and she has friends. She also goes to Polish school on a Saturday, which would clearly be advantageous to her if she was to move to Poland but is also important for her now in understanding her background and identity. The mother has identified a school in Poland for A that appears to very much promote the use of English and which has a place for her in September 2023. It therefore does not appear that A&#8217;s education would suffer if she was to relocate to Poland. It seems to me that the school identified by the mother would ensure that A continues to receive a good education and will be able to maintain her use of English. Likewise, there is nothing to suggest that A will not reach her educational potential if she continues to attend school in the UK. A has of course completed all of her primary education to date in the UK. </p>

In my view, this was an issue previously when the father would travel out of the jurisdiction for extended periods of time. It seems that during these periods, his contact with A was limited. For at least the last year however, the father has undoubtedly shown clear commitment to A. He has attended for regular contact on a Friday and a Sunday, and for additional time as agreed between the parties. Telephone contact has also taken place at A&#8217;s request. In my view, the father&#8217;s commitment has perhaps been questionable in the past but that has not been the case for over a year now and having heard his oral evidence, I am satisfied that he is committed and will continue to be committed to the very important role that he plays in A&#8217;s life. </p>

He says this was for medical reasons, although this was not mentioned in the statements he has filed in the proceedings. In my view, while the father may have had some medical treatment in Pakistan, this was not the only or primary reason for him spending time there. This would have mentioned in his statements if that was the case. The father has family in Pakistan and gave evidence that his family are building a house there, which the whole family can use as a holiday home. He maintains that he has no plans to relocate to Pakistan. The father accepts that he has also previously discussed the possibility of relocating to Canada because he has family there. During his evidence, he suggested that he had not made a decision on this but then later said that he had no plans to move there. On balance, I accept that there are no plans on the part of the father to move to Canada or to Pakistan. It seems to me that while, in theory, the father could explore the possibility of moving to Canada, there is very little chance of him doing so at present and no steps have been taken by him in respect of such a move. The father told me that A is his priority, and he wants to continue playing a big part in her life. I accept that evidence. </p>

Likewise, over the last 12 months, A&#8217;s relationship with her father has flourished because of the consistent spending-time with arrangements that are in place. It is agreed by all parties that A very much enjoys and looks forward to spending time with her father at least twice a week, and sometimes more frequently.

A&#8217;s school attendance was previously a concern due to some reported health issues and there was some concern that her educational development was delayed but she does not meet the criteria for special educational needs support. As A is of mixed heritage, it is important that she is supported to understand and embrace that by both of her parents. A attends primary school and also Polish school on a Saturday where she learns about Polish language and culture. A is encouraged to celebrate Eid and did so this year by going out for a meal with both of her parents. It is agreed between the parents that A should continue to be encouraged to understand and embrace her Pakistani heritage and her Polish heritage. </p>

The evidence shows that the mother is attuned to A&#8217;s needs, and I am confident that if I was to grant the mother&#8217;s application, she would do everything she could to ensure a smooth transition for A.</span></p>

At present, the father lives locally to A and sees her at least twice a week on a Friday for three hours and a Sunday for three hours. It is common ground that additional contact also takes place some weeks as agreed between the parties and that, from time to time, contact takes place with both parents and A all in attendance. It is agreed by all parties that the current frequency of contact would inevitably reduce if A relocates to Poland, although the mother does propose contact every two months with her bringing A to the UK, and on another three occasions each year with the father travelling to Poland. There would also be additional contact during the Polish school holidays and on Polish bank holidays. Whilst these are generous proposals, it is, in my judgment, nothing like the same as what A experiences now and what she is now familiar with. At present, A sees her father very regularly. It is an arrangement that she has become familiar with over the past 12 months and all of the evidence suggests that this something she benefits hugely from. If the mother&#8217;s proposals were adopted, there would still be a significant reduction in the frequency of contact and, on balance, the number of hours overall that A and her father would spend together. In my view, this will be a significant loss for A. She has spent the last year establishing and developing her relationship with her father, which has flourished. I accept the evidence of Ms M that, on balance, this relationship will be diminished by a significant reduction in the frequency of contact, and this will be a very significant loss for A. </span></p>

The mother&#8217;s proposals, while generous and carefully thought through, simply cannot replicate or replace the relationship that A already has with her father, which has clearly flourished over the past year. As I have already acknowledged, there are benefits to A of moving to Poland but when balancing all of the relevant factors, the harm to A that will be caused by the inevitable change in her relationship with her father outweighs the benefits to her of relocating.
