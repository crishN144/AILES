By doing nothing such a parent may of course be at risk of the acquiescence exception in Article 13 (a) being satisfied but that is a separate issue.

This was because it was accepted that M&#8217;s application to the Family Court at Barnet dated 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> January 2024 - in which her witness statement said at paragraph [10] that if aware the application had been made F </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;would make an urgent application to the Court in Israel&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> and that once jurisdiction had been established in England she did </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;not oppose [F] being informed of the proceedings&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:11pt">. I agree with Ms Guha that this showed that M was not in fact asserting acquiescence on F&#8217;s part.

Rather, the court should assume the risk of harm at its highest on the evidence available to the court and then, if that risk meets the test in Art 13(b), go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm are identified. It follows that if, having considered the risk of harm at its highest on the available evidence, the court considers that it does not meet the imperatives of Art 13(b), the court is not obliged to go on to consider the question of protective measures.</span></p>

F accepts that M is a good mother, who loves her children to whom she is committed. He is right to do so. She has only ever left the two elder children in F&#8217;s sole care for one week in March 2023 and the parties&#8217; daughter has never been left in his sole care. This was not a point raised by M until relatively late. Whether or not this was (as Mr. Hames submits) a tactical move on her part, at the last moment (an attempt to bolster her case, to hold the court to ransom to what she says she would do, in forcing the children, notably C, to be separated from her if she does not get her way), I consider that M will in fact return with the children and would not choose to be separated from them for any sustained period. I simply do not accept that M, who is clearly a loving and devoted mother, would separate herself from children that she loves and for whom she has been their primary carer throughout their young lives. In my view the protective measures offered are also likely to lead to M returning to Israel.</span></p>

This will be an issue for the Israeli courts to consider. It does not downplay the serious nature of the allegations (and I emphasise that they are no more than allegations at this stage) that I am satisfied that the combination of F&#8217;s undertakings and the protective measures that are to be put in place prior to the children&#8217;s return mean that the parties will not come into contact with each other on their return to Israel (assuming M does return with the children) and that this will provide M with sufficient short-term (again a word that I emphasise) protection from the allegations of domestic abuse. </span></p>

One of the consequences of filing this lengthy material was that the lawyers acting for M sought to counter it by seeking to instruct an expert who could advise on the realities of day-to-day life there. The agreed instructions, which I will return to below, went wider than that. To achieve parity between the parties and because I perceived there to be some potential utility in this line of enquiry, I granted leave for Dr Yedeliev to be instructed. I have explained how the expert came to be instructed in this case because I wish to signal, in the clearest possible terms, that such instructions should, in my judgement, be regarded as exceptional and rarely necessary. The key elements of the evidence and those upon which I have relied, were largely available directly from the parties and could, to my mind, have been presented, succinctly, in their own statements. &#8230; All this, however, simply indicates that the issue we are concerned with is, of itself, likely to be unreceptive to expert assessment.</span></p>
