It is a sad and potentially relevant fact that there has been virtually continuous litigation since the Second Respondent, the London Borough of Croydon (&#8220;the Local Authority&#8221;) issued care proceedings in January 2009.  On any view, the litigation needs to be brought to a final conclusion.     </p>

Fortunately, the tracheotomy has subsequently been removed although she still has a stoma.  It is hoped that it may be possible to close this later in the year.  </p>

She has therefore resided with them for almost exactly five years.  It is the only home she has known.  She is a delightful child.  She is very loving and affectionate.  She is extremely well attached to the Applicants and clearly views them for all purposes as her parents, even though she describes the Father as her &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">other Daddy</span>&#8221; when in the Applicants&#8217; home.  The Applicants are devoted to her and have given her an extraordinarily good level of care.  They are extremely committed to her and her welfare.  She also has a very strong bond with their fifteen year old son.  It is clear that it is mutual.  She is described as having &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">high energy</span>.&#8221;  Her behaviour can be challenging at times.   She finds change very difficult.  She needs consistent vigilant care and firm boundaries.  There can be no dispute that she gets this and more from the Applicants.  They are very strong advocates for her.  </p>

I make no criticism of them in this regard at all.  It is, though, a fact that they have been ruled out as potential carers for N.  Whilst I will return to the issue in due course, there is agreement from everybody that, whatever order I make, N should continue to have contact with the Father and Paternal Grandmother as this is in her best interests in the long term.   The Applicants are completely signed up to this.  Indeed, the most recent contact on 8th April 2014 took place in the community at Kidspace, a children&#8217;s indoor play area, at the instigation of the Applicants.  They were both present.  Afterwards, everyone went to McDonalds.  The Applicants recognise the importance for N of her paternal Nigerian heritage.  Indeed, they go further.  They have also instituted contact for N with her four half-siblings, recognising the importance of this to N and the Jamaican heritage she has through her Mother.   </p>

They want her to become a full member of their family for the rest of her life.  They see this as particularly important in view of her disabilities and the likelihood that she will be dependent on them long after she has attained her majority.  They want to be able to change her name to theirs and for her to become legally their daughter.  They make it clear, however, that they are fully committed to her whatever the outcome of this application.  They say they recognise the importance of contact and will commit to this, in writing if necessary.  They envisage contact four times per annum as long as it meet&#8217;s N&#8217;s best interests.  They oppose, however, a formal contact order on the basis that it is unnecessary and inappropriate.</p>

They say that it is inappropriate both on the law and the facts.  They urge me to make a special guardianship order in favour of the Applicants.   Whatever I decide, they also urge me to make a contact order.  I am asked to do so on the basis that the minimum level of contact remains as it is now, namely once per month for four hours.  It is clear, however, from the Father&#8217;s statement that he seeks in due course to increase this significantly.  He says that, in the future, he would like N to have unsupervised contact at his home.  It seems tolerably clear that he would like this to start as soon as he has moved from his current one room property which he shares with his mother to a three bedroom property that he suggests is close to fruition.  He adds that he would like this to progress to staying contact one weekend per month and that, in the future, he would love to be able to take N to Nigeria so she can meet her extended family, including her great grandmother.  </p>

When determining what is in the welfare of the child, the court must have regard to the checklist set out in section 1(4).   Section 1(6) provides that the court must always consider the whole range of powers available to it (whether under the 2002 Act or the Children Act 1989) but must not make any order under the 2002 Act unless it considers that making the order would be better for the child than not doing so.</p>

A child&#8217;s circumstances may &#8220;require&#8221; statutory intervention, perhaps may even &#8220;require&#8221; the indefinite or long-term removal of the child from  the family and his or her placement with strangers but that is not to say that the same circumstances will necessarily &#8220;require&#8221; that the child be adopted.  They may or they may not. The question, at the end of the day, is whether what is &#8220;required&#8221; is adoption.&#8221;</span></p>

It is what is demanded rather than what is merely optional or reasonable or desirable.  It is a stringent and demanding test.  The court should begin with a preference for the less interventionist rather than the more interventionist approach.  This should be considered to be in the better interests of children unless there are cogent reasons to the contrary (<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re O (Care or Supervision Order)</span> [1996] 2 FLR 755 at 760.</p>

In short, nothing else will do (per Lady Hale at paragraph [198]).  I entirely accept that this is because the interests of the child self-evidently require her relationship with her natural parents to be maintained unless no other course is possible in the child&#8217;s interest (Lord Neuberger at Paragraphs [76] to [77]).  Cutting off all contact and the relationship between the child and her family is only justified by the overriding necessity of the interests of the child (Lady Hale at Paragraph [198]).</p>

He said it was time to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">call a halt</span>&#8221;.  The evidence placed before the court must address all the options which are realistically possible and must contain an analysis of the arguments for and against each option and, in particular, the nature and extent of the risk of harm involved in each of the options (Paragraph [34]).  The need for analysis of the pros and cons and a full reasoned recommendation was essential if the exacting test set out in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> and the requirements of Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention are to be met (Paragraph [36]).  There must be adequately reasoned judgments (Paragraph [43]).  The court rejected a linear approach whereby each option other than the most draconian is considered and rejected in isolation.  Instead, a balancing exercise is required in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weigh its own internal positives and negatives.  Each option should then be compared, side by side, against the competing option or options (Paragraphs [49] &#8211; [50]).  </p>

If the court so found, Mr Southey advised that the Father would then have reasonably strong arguments that his removal would be unlawful as contrary to Article 8.

An application can be made for such variation or revocation by a parent of the child concerned (section 14D) although the parent requires leave to do so and the threshold for obtaining a variation or revocation is clearly higher than for a section 8 order.  Second, however, the order only lasts until the child&#8217;s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday.

The carer is given clear responsibility for all aspects of caring for the child and for making decisions to do with their upbringing, whilst retaining the legal link between the child and their birth family.  Paragraph [11] quotes from the White Paper entitled &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Adoption: A New Approach&#8221;.  </span>It says that children who cannot be adopted for whatever reason require an order (special guardianship) that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">provide(s) a firm foundation on which to build a lifelong permanent relationship between the carer and the child or young person.&#8221;</span>  I can only interpret this to apply in a non-legal sense because special guardianship certainly does not create such a lifelong permanent legal relationship.  Indeed, it seems clear to me that on N&#8217;s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday she would retain no legal connection with the Applicants were such an order to be made.

I am satisfied that, regardless of the excellent progress that she has made, she will still be dependent on the Applicants, probably indefinitely and certainly well into her adult life.  Many of her disabilities (such as her autism and development delay) have not altered and will not alter notwithstanding her progress in other areas.  I am not going to consider in detail the jurisdiction of the Court of Protection after her 18th birthday.  The simple fact of the matter is that she needs to have as her legal parents at that point the people who will by then have cared for her exclusively for over 17 years of her life.  This is what makes this case so exceptional.  Special guardianship simply does not fit the bill in this regard at all.  Adoption does.  It is necessary and required.</p>

She is embedded emotionally into their family but she needs to be embedded legally there as well.  This is as important for her as it is for the Applicants and their son.  I accept that she does not and probably never will understand the legal concept of adoption but she does understand the concept of being a full member of a family.  It is overwhelmingly in her interests that she is a full member of this family as a matter of law.  In short, she must have permanence and total security there.  Adoption is the only order that will give her that permanence and security.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel5" style="margin-left:1.12in;border:none">Whilst I look at this entirely from the perspective of N, the position of the Applicants is a very relevant consideration.  They have invested an enormous commitment into N.  They need to know that her presence with them is complete and not susceptible to challenge.  If that were not the case, I consider there is a real possibility that it might have an adverse impact on the welfare of N.  This would not be because the Applicants would not remain fully committed to her but the uncertainty and potential concerns as to what might be around the corner and what problems they may encounter when she attains her majority have a real potential to cause difficulties for N herself.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel5" style="margin-left:1.12in;border:none">I am very concerned about the litigation that has taken place in this case.  Litigation is a real concern for carers at the best of times.  This litigation has been going on for over five years at an intense level. I have not heard oral evidence from the Father and Paternal Grandmother but I do have a real concern that a special guardianship order would not be the end of the battle.  The Father&#8217;s statement talks about unsupervised contact, staying contact and even contact in Nigeria.  In one sense it is understandable why he makes such comments.  I am, however, concerned that he has not fully come to terms with being ruled out as a carer.  Mr Macdonald&#8217;s submissions reinforce that concern in so far as they repeatedly refer to there being no threshold findings having been made against him.  The risk of ongoing continuing litigation with no understanding of the effect of that on N&#8217;s carers is something that this court must consider in deciding on the appropriate order.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel5" style="margin-left:1.12in;border:none">N has never lived with her Father or her Paternal Grandmother.  There is no family member available to care for her.  The Father and Paternal Grandmother have been ruled out and their appeal in that regard was dismissed.  N has only ever had supervised contact to them.  This is not to downplay their importance.  It is merely a fact.  It is accepted by the Applicants that the Father and the Paternal Grandmother are a vital part of N&#8217;s heritage.  They are committed to contact.  I accept the evidence that this is a genuine commitment that will not be reconsidered once they have adopted N.  They have shown their attitude clearly by setting up contact with N&#8217;s mother&#8217;s other children.  It follows that adoption in this particular case will not stop contact from continuing with the parental birth family.  This is important.</p>

I have already indicated that it is accepted by the Applicants unreservedly that N needs to continue to see her Father and Paternal Grandmother.  They propose four times per annum which I accept is a high level of contact in the context of an adoption.  Even this is not agreed.  The Father seeks a continuation of the order for monthly contact.  </p>

Judge Atkins rejected that and approved a care plan that provided for quarterly contact.  The Applicants have now come to that conclusion as well.  This not a cause for criticism of them.  They are immensely committed parents who will do what is in N&#8217;s best interests.  If they come to the conclusion that the contact should increase, I am sure they will increase it in the same way that they told the court they intended to set aside the whole day so that it can be extended beyond two hours if it is going well.</p>

She knows who her other Daddy is but, unlike most children, she does not have the concept of time to know that she sees him in any form of particular frequency.</p>

I am giving the Applicants sole parental responsibility for N by the adoption order.  They become her parents and are to be trusted to do what is right for her as any parent would do for their child.  Applying section 1(6) of the 2002 Act, I am quite satisfied that it is not better for N to make such an order.  Apart from anything else, there must be finality to this litigation.  The ability to apply to vary a contact order would be very deleterious to N&#8217;s welfare.</p>

I have already found that the Applicants are to be trusted in this regard but, in any event, I remind myself that there is still the ability of the court to grant the Father permission to make an application for contact.  In this particular case, if the contact was to stop, I have no doubt that a judge would, at the very least, want an explanation from the Applicants.  The safety valve of being able to make that application is fatal to Mr Macdonald&#8217;s submission that there needs to be a contact order.</p>
