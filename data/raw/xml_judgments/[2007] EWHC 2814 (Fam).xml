	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This judgment is being handed down following the conclusion of proceedings relating to the parentage and future upbringing of a baby girl, M, who was born on the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2006. M was conceived as a result of a surrogacy arrangement made between a married couple, Mr and Mrs G, and the surrogate mother, Mrs J. Such noncommercial surrogacy arrangements are not illegal and, whilst not frequent, form an accepted means whereby a child may be brought into being for the benefit of married couples who have encountered difficulties in conceiving a child without intervention. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Since 1994 the law has provided for the commissioning parents to achieve the status of full parents of a child born following such a surrogacy arrangement by obtaining a &#8216;parental order&#8217; under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilization and Embryology Act 1990</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/30" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 30</ref> [<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 1990</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/30" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 30</ref>]. A parental order, if granted, is of like effect to an adoption order with the consequence that the child is for all purposes treated in law as a child of the marriage and not a child of any other person. Since 1994 the granting of parental orders in appropriate cases has become an accepted and unremarkable aspect of the work of the family court. </p>

What renders the case of young M remarkable, and justifies this detailed judgment, is that Mr and Mrs G, the commissioning parents, are Turkish nationals who are domiciled in Turkey. As a result, it is not legally possible for them to achieve the status of M&#8217;s parents by means of a parental order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The procedural history of this case, to which I am about to turn, is a cautionary tale which highlights the legal, emotional, and not least the financial consequences of surrogacy arrangements which are undertaken in this jurisdiction involving commissioning parents who are not domiciled in the UK. The law relating to the removal of children from the UK for adoption overseas is both complex and strict. This case has therefore involved some seven court hearings in the High Court in order to pick a way through the legal maze to achieve the most effective legal arrangement under which the commissioning parents can remove M to their home in Turkey in the hope of adopting her under Turkish law. The process has required, as a matter of law, a full social-work assessment by the relevant local authority and by a children&#8217;s guardian appointed by CAFCASS. Expert legal opinion has been required as to the current state of Turkish law. I am advised that the total cost of the social work and legal input in unravelling the consequences of the arrangement that led to M&#8217;s birth is just short of &#163;35,000.00. That sum falls to be paid entirely by the British tax payer, the court being satisfied, in the circumstances of this case, that it would not be appropriate to seek to re-coup any of those costs from Mr and Mrs G, Mrs J or COTS, the surrogacy agency who assisted Mr and Mrs G in establishing the arrangement.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In emotional terms, the nine months that it has taken to resolve matters before the English Court will have undoubtedly caused stress and instability for Mr and Mrs G and consequently, M, at the very time when they should have been free to settle down to their new family life and devote all their emotional energies to the task of nurturing a young baby.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The court has been told, and accepts, that, hitherto, from time to time couples who are domiciled abroad have participated in successful surrogacy arrangements with UK surrogate mothers and have achieved a parental order with respect to the resulting child under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 1990</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/30" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 30</ref>. If that is indeed the case, then such orders must have been made outside the jurisdiction of the court, which, as I have indicated, is confined to applicant parents where one or both is domiciled in the UK, Channel Islands, or Isle of Man. It is to be hoped that the publication of this judgment will see an end to such unlawful parental orders being made.  </p>

As a result of that contact they were introduced to Mrs J and ultimately signed a Memorandum of Agreement with her on the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2005 under which she agreed to act as a surrogate mother for them. </p>

Some short time after the separation Mr PJ left England and took up residence in Spain.

M was born on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2006. Shortly before the birth Mr and Mrs G came to England and rented a flat in the locality. M was a healthy baby and when ready for discharge from the maternity hospital was given over by Mrs J to Mr and Mrs G. Since that time M has remained in the full time care of Mr and Mrs G either in England or, with the court&#8217;s agreement, back in their home state of Turkey.  </p>

A CAFCASS officer, Mrs HC, was initially appointed as the &#8216;parental order reporter&#8217; but was subsequently appointed as M&#8217;s guardian ad litem in the proceedings under FPR 1991, rule 9.5. A solicitor was appointed to act on M&#8217;s behalf on the instructions of Mrs HC. It is, at this stage, appropriate to record that the court has been very greatly assisted by the work of that solicitor and counsel in achieving an appropriate resolution of these proceedings.  </p>

COTS say that, for there to be valid consent, Mr PJ would have had to be present at the &#8216;COTS Information Meeting&#8217; and would have had to indicate that he consented to the treatment with full knowledge of the status that he would thereby have as the legal father of the child under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 1990</ref>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The court has not heard argument on the point and has not been expressly referred to the relevant HFEA guidelines. The submissions made by COTS on this issue, which were made at a hearing following my earlier declaration that Mr PJ did not consent, do not require determination in this case. It is however right to record that this court does not necessarily agree with the analysis suggested by COTS. Whilst the processes used at the COTS Information Meeting and at the IVF clinic may produce a situation where there is clear evidence of consent being given (where that is the case), the absence of such clear evidence does not, in my view, mean that &#8216;it is shown that he did not consent&#8217; [<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 1990</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/28/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 28(2)</ref>].

Furthermore, in the present case the actual conception was not achieved at the IVF clinic, but as a result of a process in Mrs J&#8217;s home. The wording of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/28/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 28(2)</ref> requires the court to be satisfied (&#8216;it is shown&#8217;) that the husband &#8216;did not consent&#8217;. It is therefore, in my view, necessary for the court to look more widely than simply ascertaining whether or not the husband signed a form at the clinic. </p>
