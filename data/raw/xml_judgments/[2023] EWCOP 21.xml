The application seeks a declaration that Joanna lacks the capacity to make decisions regarding her obstetric care and to litigate, and that it is in Joanna&#8217;s best interests and, therefore lawful, for the necessary obstetric care to be provided to her, including restraint if necessary. The proposal is for a planned caesarean section to take place on 18 May 2023. </p>

I set out my reasons in a written judgment for two reasons. First and most important, it will stand as a full and fair record for the benefit of Joanna so that she can be reassured that these proceedings were conducted totally fairly and justly. My second reason is that it is in the interests of transparency for the judgment to be made available publicly, so that the wider public can see that these cases in the Court of Protection are conducted openly and not clandestinely behind closed doors. </p>

I therefore made an RRO on that day to restrict the publication of any information which may lead to the identification of Joanna, her family or the clinicians providing her with care, to last until 15 May 2025 unless varied in the meantime </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Joanna was recently diagnosed with first episode psychosis. At the hearing on 15 May 2023, Dr M explained to me that this is the first presentation of psychosis which is further assessed over time to explore whether it may become a formal diagnosis of, for example, schizophrenia. The symptoms are both positive and negative. Examples of positive symptoms include hearing voices and experiencing hallucinations along with fixed and firmly held delusional beliefs. Dr M opined that Joanna historically and currently experiences such symptoms. Negative symptoms include poverty of thoughts, lack of speech, a markedly reduced range of emotional expression and a lack of functioning including neglecting one&#8217;s self-care, all of which Dr M told me she has clearly observed in Joanna. Dr M further explained that these negative symptoms tend to present after a long episode of untreated psychosis and opined that Joanna&#8217;s psychosis has gone undetected for at least a year, indicating a poorer prognosis in terms of recovery.</p>

She is therefore genetically inclined to the illness, which is further compounded by her traumatic upbringing. Dr M explained that as Joanna was in care as a child, this level of trauma also left her vulnerable to developing psychosis.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Throughout Joanna&#8217;s admission to hospital, she has experienced a great fear that normal actions and movement will harm her unborn child and lead to miscarriage. Due to her presentation and recent diagnosis of first episode psychosis, there is a medical concern that she may not cooperate during a vaginal delivery, which may then result in having to undergo an emergency caesarean section. There is a higher risk of complications associated with such. </p>

The most recent reassessment took place on 9 May 2023, when Dr M and Dr A visited Joanna at hospital. They observed that Joanna was unable to name any risks associated with a caesarean section. In her evidence at the hearing, Dr M explained to me:</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I address first the starting point that it is in a person&#8217;s best interests to live, save in those rare cases where it is objectively demonstrable that it is not in a person&#8217;s best interests to receive life sustaining treatment. This starting point is applicable here given the potential consequences of non-compliance or aggression during a vaginal delivery and the required antenatal care. Without appropriate management of the situation this has the potential to be life-threatening to both Joanna and her child. Dr A considers it very unlikely that Joanna will be able to comply with the care and interventions that may be needed. This could lead to an emergency caesarean section which carries a greater risk to Joanna and her child than a planned caesarean section. </p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221;</p>

It is my judgment that her wishes have nonetheless been expressed clearly and that they should be afforded due respect. </p>

Furthermore, if a vaginal birth were attempted against her wishes, I accept that this would only increase the risk of non-compliance and therefore pose risk of harm to Joanna and her child.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I would have concerns that if [Joanna] went into spontaneous vaginal delivery as this would trigger her anxiety and exacerbate her already fragile mental state. [Joanna] has shown a profound fear around perceived risks to her baby and I think there is a real likelihood that she may misinterpret physical sensations that can naturally occur during a vaginal delivery as harm being caused to her baby. This may prevent her from engaging with the obstetric team due to fear that movement may cause harm to her baby. </p>

This is despite [Joanna&#8217;s] account that she is happy to be pregnant and wishes to keep her baby safe.&#8221;</p>

Joanna&#8217;s mother, Tina (not her actual name), has expressed support for Joanna&#8217;s preference to give birth via a caesarean section. Dr R made telephone contact with Joanna&#8217;s mother on 25 April 2023 to explore her views. The conversation is recorded as follows:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[Tina] highlighted that [Joanna] had always been scared about giving birth and that it had taken her a long time to become pregnant. [Tina] was supportive of this as she shared that it had always been her daughter's preference for a c-section. Indeed she added that all her children had been via c-section and that neither her nor [Joanna] could every countenance a vaginal birth. Overall [Tina] feels that the c-section is what [Joanna] always wanted &#8211; and that [Joanna] had expressed this on multiple occasions whenever thinking about having children. [Tina] reported that [Joanna] had been so terrified of vaginal birth that she had talked to [Tina] about adopting instead. [Tina] stated that she wasn&#8217;t sure that restraint will be needed or resistance to the procedure will be encountered by us.&#8221;</p>

I have already referred to the opinion of Dr M that Joanna&#8217;s psychosis has gone undetected for at least a year and that therefore she has a relatively poor prognosis. Joanna&#8217;s treating clinicians are of the categorical view that it is in her best interests to proceed with the planned caesarean section, as the safest plan to ensure the healthy delivery of her child. </p>
