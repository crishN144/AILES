The ADB is represented by Mr Stewart Leech, Queen&#8217;s Counsel.

The court heard oral evidence from the wife, from the husband and from Mr Albert Wildgen, the current President of the Second Respondent ADB.  The court also read the respective Skeleton Arguments of the parties and heard comprehensive and eloquent closing submissions from Mr Leech, Mr Ewins and the wife, for which written and oral submissions the court is grateful. </p>

On this issue the court has had the benefit of a jointly instructed expert report prepared by Professor Kinch dated 10 November 2017 and setting out and explaining the relevant legal provisions.  Professor Kinsch is a partner in the firm of Wurth Kinch Olinger in Luxembourg and a &#8216;Professeur Honoraire&#8217; at the University of Luxembourg specialising in constitutional and private international law.  The evidence of Professor Kinch was not the subject of challenge by way of cross-examination.  All of the matters set out in the following paragraphs are matters that are in the public domain. </p>

The constitutional basis of the Restated Family Pact is set out in Art 3 of the Luxembourg Constitution of 17 October 1868, as construed in the Declaration of the Luxembourgish Prime Minister dated 25 July 2011.

These elements are, broadly, analogous to the Crown Estate in the United Kingdom.  Second, those elements of the fortune comprised of monies received by the Grand Duke from the State of Luxembourg.

As noted above, the Family Pact has been modified during the ensuing 235 years, but it remains the case that under the Restated Family Pact the ADB is a structure that holds and manages, on behalf of a reigning Grand Duke, both the GroBherzogliches Fideicommiss / fid&#233;icommis grandducal<span style="font-style:italic"/>and the assets comprising those monies received by the reigning Grand Duke from the State of Luxembourg in accordance with the provisions I have outlined above.  During the course of his oral evidence, Mr Wildgen, the current President of the ADB, confirmed that he also manages what he termed the &#8216;personal&#8217; or &#8216;private&#8217; monies of the Grand Duke.

Accordingly, Mr Wildgen explained, where it is necessary to purchase real property outside Luxembourg such property is purchased in the name of one or more members of the Royal Family on the clear understanding they hold the property in question as nominees of the ADB.  Within this context, Mr Wildgen stated as follows as to the manner in which the purchase of such foreign assets was funded:  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.43in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;In such cases the funds for the purchase (and all costs of purchase) are typically provided by the ADB (from assets belonging to the [GroBherzogliches Fideicommiss / fid&#233;icommis grand-ducal]) or from the private funds of HRH the Grand Duke.  They are transferred directly to the vendor, and the property is then acquired in the name of the member(s) of the Royal Family.  The property might be used by any member of the family.  The individuals hold the legal title as nominees and enter into a declaration which generally takes the form of a document known as a &#8216;compromis de vente&#8217; (i.e. sales contract) with the ADB, or unilateral declaration signed by the nominees, in which they confirm that they hold the asset on behalf of the ADB and/or that, on request, they will surrender the asset to the ADB.&#8221; </p>

In line with the evidence of Professor Kinch, Mr Wildgen confirmed during his oral evidence that the ultimate authority for such transactions involving the GroBherzogliches Fideicommiss / fid&#233;icommis lie with HRH the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, but that the Grand Duke is subject to stringent regulations requiring him to ensure that the monies are used in the interest of the family.   With respect to the elements of the reigning Grand Duke&#8217;s fortune comprised of those monies received by the Grand Duke from the State of Luxembourg, Mr Wildgen concurred that somewhat lesser restrictions apply, the Grand Duke being free to transfer assets to third parties pursuant to Art 5 of the Restated Family Pact. </p>

Professor Kinch details that the Council of State opinion provides that there is a principle of &#8220;separate legal personality of [a sovereign&#8217;s] private fortune, which allows it to be represented by an agent with the power to act in court.&#8221;  Professor Kinch concludes that, if that view is accepted, then the GroBherzogliches Fideicommiss / fid&#233;icommis grand ducal<span style="font-style:italic"/>must be considered analogous to a private foundation endowed with legal personality, with the ADB in charge of its management.

Within this context, as will be seen below, the wife concentrated her submissions on seeking to persuade the court that the purchase monies used by the ADB to buy the former matrimonial home belonged not to the ADB but to the Grand Duke, the wife pointing out in particular that the statement of Mr Wildgen described the ADB as implementing the decisions taken by the Grand Duke and Mr Wildgen&#8217;s oral evidence that it was the Grand Duke who decided which property in London would be purchased. </p>

When questioned by Mr Leech, the wife stated the Grand Duchess had said she would be happy to contribute personally to the purchase of the property.

Mr Wildgen stated that the ADB funded the purchase of the property with monies from the GroBherzogliches Fideicommiss / fid&#233;icommis<span style="font-style:italic"/>as distinct from the Grand Duke&#8217;s private funds (in contradistinction, I again note, to the manner in which the US property was funded).  Exhibited to Mr Wildgen&#8217;s statement is a statement of monies due on the purchase of the former matrimonial home, including stamp duty and purchase costs.  Also exhibited to Mr Wildgen&#8217;s statement are two <span style="font-style:italic">Avis de D&#233;bit </span>dated 8 July 2011 and 16 June 2011 showing payment by the ADB to the solicitors dealing with the conveyance of the former matrimonial home of the purchase price of that property.  Documents exhibited to Mr Wildgen&#8217;s statement also show payment by the ADB of insurance on the property. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Again, in contradistinction to the US property, the exhibits to Mr Wildgen&#8217;s statement also contain a copy of a <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente</span> in respect of the former matrimonial home in London, together with a translation of that document.  The <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente</span> states that the sellers are the husband and the Grand Duke, and the buyers are the ADB.  Mr Wildgen told the court that he prepared the <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente</span> personally and had it signed by the Grand Duke.   The <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente</span> is not signed by the husband and is not dated.   By way of explanation, Mr Wildgen stated in cross-examination by the wife that he suspected that the absence of the husband&#8217;s signature was an accidental omission and that, because it was awaiting the signature of the husband, which was not obtained, the <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente</span> did not come to be dated.  Mr Wildgen stated that he had not dated it when it was drafted as he did not know on what date it would be signed.  Mr Wilgden further confirmed that the <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente </span>was not registered in Luxembourg and nor was a Notarial Deed prepared, Mr Wildgen contending in his oral evidence that it was not possible to make a Notarial Deed in Luxembourg for a property located abroad.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">During his evidence, Mr Wildgen contended that these matters made no material difference as the intention regarding the ownership of the beneficial interest of the property was and is plain from the manner in which the purchase was effected by the ADB using funds from the GroBherzogliches Fideicommiss / fid&#233;icommis grand ducal, the manner in which the <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente </span>was drawn up and the terms of the same and the statements of the husband and the Grand Duke confirming they own no beneficial interest in the former matrimonial home.    Within this context, Mr Wildgen stated that the <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente </span>simply confirmed a clear existing agreement that the beneficial interest in the property would be owned by the ADB.  In his statement the husband points out that he provided a copy of the <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente</span> with his Form E dated 7 April 2017 and that the ADB wrote to the wife&#8217;s former solicitors as early as 2 June 2017 setting out its case as to the effect of the <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente</span> and the ownership of the beneficial interest in former matrimonial home generally.   </p>

Further, Mr Wildgen contended that no legal advice was given to the ADB, or to the husband or the Grand Duke, at any stage regarding the difference in English law between legal and beneficial ownership or between tenancies in common and joint tenancies.  Mr Wildgen asserted that the purchase of the former matrimonial home was the first time the ADB had bought real property in England.   </p>

In cross examination, the wife told the court that the property &#8220;was for us to keep and grow with our children&#8221;.  However, when pressed by Mr Ewins, she also stated that she and the husband had thought they would stay in London for at least two years to finish their degrees but would then &#8220;see what we would do&#8221;, stating that &#8220;we just took it one day at a time&#8221;.  In his statement, the husband contends that the property was occupied as the family&#8217;s home but that he never signed any formal documentation in relation to that occupation. During the course of his oral evidence, the husband told the court that when they arrived in London, the husband and the wife believed that they would stay for the duration of their studies but had not excluded the possibility that they might remain in the property longer.  As I have noted, on behalf of the ADB, in his statement Mr Wildgen stated that the property was purchased by the ADB using funds from the GroBherzogliches Fideicommiss / fid&#233;icommis grand ducal for the husband and wife to live in whilst they were based in London for their continuing studies.   </p>

The husband moved to Paris where he currently resides with his sister in a family property.  The husband expressed an intention to the court to move out of this property and into rented accommodation funded by himself as soon as he is able to afford to do so.  The children spend time with each parent but at present reside with the wife in the former matrimonial home in London.  <span style="font-style:italic">Decree nisi</span> was granted on 17 February 2017.

The wife continues to owe some &#163;66,000 to her former solicitors.  The upshot of this extremely unfortunate situation is that the options available to the court to meet the respective needs of the parties arising out of their marriage are now far more constrained than they might otherwise have been.  It is one more example, of the far too many similar examples seen by these courts, of couples engaging in expensive and protracted internecine financial warfare, the only result of which is to place them, and their children, in a materially worse position than they would have been had they been able to engage constructively in seeking a consensual solution. </p>

The husband however, contends that his prospects for any further inheritance remain uncertain.  In his answers to the wife&#8217;s questionnaire, the husband conceded that at the time the early payment was made there was discussion of the further inheritance monies, possibly in the region of &#8364;1M, being paid to him and his siblings were this to be affordable.  The husband asserts however, that this was stated as no more than a possibility and certainly not a firm expectation, with no timescale being discussed. The husband repeated this position in his statement.  Within this context, the husband contended that he has no expectation of receiving any further inheritance in the foreseeable future.  The wife rejected this assertion and stated that it had been made it clear that this future payment was &#8220;much more than a possibility&#8221;.

Whilst the letter expresses concern that its contents remain &#8220;absolutely private&#8221;, the contents of the letter are entirely anodyne in nature and express a position that might be taken by any number of parents whose adult children find themselves in the situation in which the husband now finds himself.   </p>

Within this context however, the letter from Le Mar&#233;chal de la Cour on behalf of the Grand Duke and the Grand Duchess makes clear that, as a matter of precedent, principle and fairness between the husband and his siblings, they do not intend to increase the funds they provide to the husband by way of an allowance as a means of meeting any financial award made by the court for the wife. </p>

The wife also contended that the Grand Duke regularly made the husband gifts of money and that the husband &#8220;has never had an issue with money&#8221;.  She maintained that the husband would be in a position to ask his parents for an increase in his allowance or an advance in his inheritance to enable him to meet any obligations imposed upon him by the court.  Further, the wife contended that in circumstances where the husband had been able to obtain an unsecured loan in the sum of &#163;50,000 to pay his legal expenses for this hearing, he would also be able to obtain a loan to meet obligations imposed on him by the court. Within this context, the wife contended that the husband would not, for example, have a difficulty in finding the extra &#163;20,000 per annum representing the difference between his current income and the figure in child maintenance sought by the wife.   </p>

In his statement the husband confirms that he held 150 shares in Audaces Seed Investors Ltd, as confirmed by a copy of the share certificate, which had a value of &#163;30,000 at the time his Form E was filed.  Thereafter, in his statement dated 14 September 2018, the husband states that the staff of Audaces Seed Investors Ltd moved to a company called U-Kobo and that, in consequence, Audaces Seed Investors Ltd &#8220;will be liquidated and so my investment has been lost&#8221;.  The husband contends that he received no money for his shares in the company albeit, as a goodwill gesture for being an early investor in Audaces Seed Investors Ltd, he <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> receive shares in the company that owns U-Kobo.

With respect to Audaces Seed Investors Ltd, the company in which the husband held shares, Mr del Piane states that this entity is indeed being wound up and that U-Kobo is a new endeavour being developed by most of the ex-Audaces partners.  He further confirms that, given the husband&#8217;s personal relationship with the partners of U-Kobo, it remains the intention in due course, and following some measure of success, that U-Kobo will offer shares as a gesture of goodwill via a passthrough entity in the United Kingdom. </p>

The wife contended that this was because she had not altered all of the boxes in her original Form E as drafted by her former solicitors and that her failure to mention the position in respect of her employment was not an omission of bad faith.

The wife noted that she and the husband had houses bought for them to live in wherever they wished to live and never wanted for funds, setting out in her statement those amounts she contends were made available to the parties, negating </p>

Indeed, Mr Leech went further and made clear to the court that, in the event that the court acceded to the case advanced by the husband and the ADB (and emphasising that what the ADB is prepared to provide is ultimately a matter for it and not the court) the ADB considers the elements of the open proposal it advances to constitute a binding obligation, required to provide a solution in an otherwise insoluble case.  </p>

The whole of his judgment proceeds upon the footing that he had a free hand to decide what was the common intention of the parties at the relevant time but that inquiry was simply not open to him unless the defendant had established a case for setting the declaration of trust aside. </p>

But there was no claim for rectification in this case and Mr Small for the defendant has not advanced a case that the transfer could be rectified so as to omit the declaration of trust. There was no evidence at trial that it was inserted by mistake or that the parties intended to execute a transfer in materially different terms. There is no evidence in the form of the solicitors' file as to how the transfer came to include the declaration of trust and on whose instructions nor do we know what input (if any) the building society had with regard to the form of the transfer although it seems to me unlikely that it would have been concerned with anything beyond both parties being legal owners so that they became parties to the mortgage.&#8221; </p>

The availability of unidentified resources may, for example, be inferred from a spouse's expenditure or style of living, or from his inability or unwillingness to allow the complexity of his affairs to be penetrated with the precision necessary to ascertain his actual wealth or the degree of liquidity of his assets. Another is that where a spouse enjoys access to wealth but no absolute entitlement to it (as in the case, for example, of a beneficiary under a discretionary trust or someone who is dependent on the generosity of a relative), the court will not act in direct invasion of the rights of, or usurp the discretion exercisable by, a third party. Nor will it put upon a third party undue pressure to act in a way which will enhance the means of the maintaining spouse. This does not, however, mean that the court acts in total disregard of the potential availability of wealth from sources owned or administered by others. There will be occasions when it becomes permissible for a judge deliberately to frame his orders in a form which affords judicious encouragement to third parties to provide the maintaining spouse with the means to comply with the court's view of the justice of the case. There are bound to be instances where the boundary between improper pressure and judicious encouragement proves to be a fine one, and it will require attention to the particular circumstances of each case to see whether it has been crossed.&#8221; </p>

If the court makes a reasonable request of trustees to make funds available to meet an ancillary relief award then it can assume that ordinarily the trustees will accede to such a request. The same cannot be assumed of a request of a mere donor, for it is his prerogative to be unreasonable, if that is his inclination. </p>

In particular, Mr Ewins sought to remind the court that both properties were purchased with monies provided by the ADB, in respect of both properties the legal title was held by the husband and the Grand Duke and that there was no dispute between the parties that in respect of both properties upon any sale the proceeds would be returned to the ADB.

Within this context, Mr Ewins contended in his closing submissions that, having given a very clear indication to the court that it will bind itself to the terms of its offer if the court prefers its case, the housing provision which the ADB has assured the court will be provided to the wife and the children is significantly more advantageous to her than that which it is in the power of the court to confer upon her. </p>

Finally, even were the case to come within <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas v Thomas</span>, Mr Ewins argues that the provision to be made voluntarily by the husband&#8217;s parents in respect of school fees and medical expenses, and by the ADB in respect of housing constitutes the requisite provision. </p>

Whilst Mr Ewins concedes that the removal from the husband&#8217;s budget of those items that are paid for by his family leaves him with a higher disposable balance, Mr Ewins submits that the court must take account of the fact that the husband&#8217;s budget is not detailed and the provision he is ordered to make must be fair.  Within this context, Mr Ewins submits that the wife is an educated, talented and ambitious woman who the court can be confident will obtain employment at a similar level of remuneration to that she has enjoyed in her previous and current employment, namely between &#163;40,000 and &#163;75,000 per annum gross. Further, Mr Ewins submits that the wife&#8217;s earning capacity and income are significantly higher than the husband&#8217;s. In addition, Mr Ewins submits that the wife&#8217;s budget is &#8220;utterly unrealistic&#8221; (that budget generating a &#163;35,000 shortfall on her <span style="font-style:italic">own</span> case) and reminds the court that the wife accepted that the husband could not afford her demands on the figures he has given. </p>

Within this context, and reminding the court that it has no power to compel the ADB to enlarge its offer to the wife, Mr Leech once again sought to contrast the foregoing highly constrained outcome with the offer made by the ADB, which he submitted would ensure that the needs of the children, the court&#8217;s first priority, are met during their minority and until the end of the younger child&#8217;s first degree, with the wife being provided with secure accommodation, rent and mortgage free whether she cohabits or remarries or not, over which 12 year period the wife, who is a highly capable, independent minded, ambitious person could establish herself and make provision for future accommodation.  </p>

Firstly, by reason of the distinction the existence of the <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente</span> creates between the manner in which the property in US property was purchased.  When using <span style="font-style:italic">private</span> funds of Grand Duke to purchase the US property, no <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente </span>was drafted by the ADB.  When using funds from the GroBherzogliches Fideicommiss / fid&#233;icommis grand-ducal<span style="font-style:italic"/>to purchase the former matrimonial home a <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente </span>was completed by the ADB.  Whilst Mr Ewins emphasised the similarities between these two property transactions, in my judgment it is the differences between the manner in which the respective properties were purchased that are more significant.  In particular, the fact that when the funds came from the GroBherzogliches Fideicommiss / fid&#233;icommis grand-ducal as distinct from the private funds of the Grand Duke, a <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente </span>designed, as I am satisfied it was, to evidence the ADB&#8217;s interest was employed.  Secondly, by reason of the fact that, whilst incomplete, the terms of <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente</span> themselves constitute evidence of the intention of the husband, the Grand Duke and the ADB that the ADB would retain the beneficial interest in the former matrimonial home.  </p>

In these circumstances and having regard to the legal principles set out above, I am satisfied that the effect of the matters set out in the foregoing paragraphs was to create, upon the payment of the purchase monies from the GroBherzogliches Fideicommiss / fid&#233;icommis grand-ducal by the ADB, a resulting trust of the beneficial interest in the former matrimonial home in favour of the legal entity that provided the entirety of the purchase monies for that property.  Whether the beneficial interest in the former matrimonial home is owned under the resulting trust by the ABD, which paid the purchase monies, or the GroBherzogliches Fideicommiss / fid&#233;icommis grand-ducal, which provided the purchase monies, is perhaps a point of some nicety. However, it is not necessary to decide that point for the purposes of the decision this court has to make.  The key point is that the purchase monies did not, I am satisfied, come from </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I remain cognisant of the principle in <span style="font-style:italic">Goodman v Galant</span>.  However, whilst in <span style="font-style:italic">Goodman v Galant </span>the Court of Appeal stated that there is no room for the application of the doctrine of resulting or constructive trusts &#8220;unless and until the conveyance is set aside or rectified&#8221;, in <span style="font-style:italic">Pankhania v Chandegra </span>I perceive the point as having been expressed in somewhat less absolute terms, with the Court of Appeal stating that there is no room for the application of the doctrine of resulting or constructive trusts unless the defendant has &#8220;established a case for setting the declaration of trust aside&#8221;.   Within this context, it seems to me that, given the foregoing evidence before this court, it would be artificial in this case to proceed on the basis of the TR1 when it is plain on that evidence that the husband and the Grand Duke were not &#8220;able&#8221; to declare a trust of the beneficial interest by reference to the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/53/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 53(1)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Law of Property Act 1925</ref> and, as Mr Leech submits, any application to set aside the declaration on the grounds of mistake would be bound to succeed (accepting that no such application is before the court).  A trust of the beneficial interest in the former matrimonial home was not the husband&#8217;s and the Grand Duke&#8217;s to declare.  In short, you cannot declare an express trust in a beneficial interest that is not yours (or, to indulge in the Latin, <span style="font-style:italic">nemo dat quod non habet</span>).    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I have, of course, given careful consideration to the contrasting arguments advanced by the wife in support of her case that the husband <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> own a share of the beneficial interest in the former matrimonial home.  I have dealt with the wife&#8217;s contentions regarding the TR1 in detail above.   With respect to the wife&#8217;s assertion that some of the funds provided for the purchase of the US property constituted a gift to the husband from his mother, which funds were subsequently used to purchase the London property, as very properly accepted by the wife of her own volition, no corroborating evidence of the conversation said to ground that assertion is before the court or exists.  The assertion was not raised by the wife prior to the hearing (she stating, perhaps understandably, that she had not appreciated the continuing legal significance of the disposal of Florida property within these proceedings).  Further, the wife did not challenge Mr Wildgen&#8217;s evidence that the funds to purchase the US property were provided by the ADB from the Grand Duke&#8217;s &#8216;private&#8217; funds and appeared to accept during her evidence that the proceeds of sale from the US property were returned to the ADB in their entirety.  In any event, as I have noted above, the chronology makes clear that the former matrimonial home was paid for by the ADB with funds from GroBherzogliches Fideicommiss / fid&#233;icommis grand-ducal prior to the sale of the US property.  With respect to the wife&#8217;s argument regarding the omissions in the <span style="font-style:italic">compromis de vente, </span>whilst it is plain that the husband did not sign that document and that the document is undated, those omissions do not act to alter my conclusions as to what intention is evidenced by the terms of that document within the context of my finding that the ADB paying for the former matrimonial home with funds from GroBherzogliches Fideicommiss / fid&#233;icommis grand-ducal.  Finally, with respect to the email from Mr von Habsburg, as I have already set out I am satisfied that Mr von Habsburg&#8217;s description of the parties as owners in his email of 11 August 2011 is a term of art or a shorthand, rather than an accurate description of the manner in which the former matrimonial home was held following the transaction.   </p>

As to the contents of the post nuptial settlement, on the evidence I have set out above I am satisfied that what has been created by that post nuptial settlement is an interest which, although sufficiently enduring to satisfy the criterion of making &#8216;continuing provision&#8217;, is analogous to a bare licence determinable on the giving of a reasonable period of notice.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment, this conclusion is consistent with the evidence the court heard regarding the parties&#8217; intentions with respect to the use of the London property.  As I have noted, in his statement on behalf of the ADB, Mr Wildgen contended that the property was purchased for the husband and wife to live in whilst they were based in London for their continuing studies.  Within this context, both the husband and wife gave evidence that was consistent with there being no firm or settled intention that the family would remain in the property for a defined period, let alone indefinitely.  During the course of his oral evidence, the husband told the court that when they arrived in London the husband and the wife believed that they would stay for the duration of their studies, although they had not entirely excluded the possibility that they might remain in the property longer.   Within this context, the wife stated that it was her understanding that the former matrimonial home had been provided for them for so long as they resided in London, she telling the court that the former matrimonial home was purchased &#8220;as a home for them to grow their family in and live at&#8221; and had been provided as a place where &#8220;we would raise the children&#8221;.   However, in addition, when pressed by Mr Ewins in cross examination, the wife also stated that she and the husband had thought they would stay in London for two years to finish their degrees but would then &#8220;see what we would do&#8221;.  Indeed, the wife told the court that &#8220;we just took it one day at a time&#8221;.  Whilst the husband was clear that the ADB would never have simply &#8220;thrown them out&#8221; of the property, within the foregoing context, no documents were signed by the husband and wife regulating their occupation of the property, setting out a defined term of occupation or the circumstances in which their occupation would come to an end.   </p>

However, on the evidence currently before the court it is not possible, as the wife concedes, to say with sufficient certainty when he will do so.  Nor is it possible on the evidence before the court to be sufficiently certain of the amount of any further payment to be made.  In the circumstances, the husband&#8217;s future inheritance prospects are simply not a sufficiently certain foundation upon which to rest an award to the wife.  </p>

The court has before it unchallenged evidence indicating that the husband&#8217;s family do not intend to fulfil such a role.  In circumstances where the husband&#8217;s parents are under no legal or fiduciary duty to assist him financially, the court must place considerable weight on this indication contained in the letter from the Le Mar&#233;chal de la Cour to the husband.  Whilst the wife expresses the view that the husband&#8217;s parents would make good any shortfall in his ability to meet an order made by the court, beyond this bare assertion there is no other evidence to gainsay the clear statement of intent in that letter.  Within this context, I am satisfied that this is a case in which the husband has only &#8220;a mere spes of bounty&#8221;, his parents being under no legal obligation to make financial provision for the husband and having stated expressly they do not intend to do so in the context of a clearly stated rationale, namely historical precedent and fairness between their children.  It is, I am satisfied, clear on the evidence that they will not change their view. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">With respect to their needs, the wife&#8217;s primary need is for a property in which she can continue to reside with the children and for a level of income sufficient to meet her outgoings and those consequent on the care and upbringing of the children, taking into account her own income and earning capacity.  The husband has a similar need for a property in which he can reside although, whilst I accept his admirable desire to achieve independence in terms of his housing, that need is less pressing at this time than the similar need of the wife in circumstances where he has available to him a family property in which he can reside for the time being.  With respect to his income </p>

That said, I am also satisfied, for the reasons I have already given, that the husband is not able to call on his family&#8217;s wealth to meet any award that exceeds his current income. </p>

The statutory criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> and the principle of fairness must be applied to the resources that are available for distribution.  Within this context, the court must do the best it can with the matrimonial resources that are available.  This is a challenge faced by courts up and down the country on a daily basis in cases where the matrimonial assets are insufficient to meet assessed need. </p>

I am satisfied that, in the circumstances, as regards the wife&#8217;s housing need, this court is limited to varying the post nuptial settlement to provide the wife and children with a licence terminable on 6 months notice.  Whilst I accept that this does not provide the wife and children with the degree of security that the court would wish, I am satisfied that this is the limit of the court&#8217;s ability to intercede in this case as regards the housing needs of the wife and children. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in">Within the foregoing context, I am satisfied that this is an appropriate case to make a nominal spousal maintenance order. Whilst I accept that the aim of both parties in this case is financial independence, against this the current position of the wife is <span style="font-style:italic">inherently</span> uncertain in circumstances where, on the face of it, she and the children have the benefit of a bare licence to occupy their current property and the wife is in the process of ceasing her employment and looking for a new job.  In the circumstances, whilst I have every confidence that the wife will in due course establish herself, given the inherent uncertainties in her current accommodation and in her employment, on balance I am satisfied that the safety net of a nominal spousal maintenance order is justified in this case at this stage.  With respect to the term of the nominal spousal maintenance order, it follows from the conclusion that, having regard to her current income and her earning potential, the wife will in due course establish herself, the term should cover only the period it will take her to achieve this adjustment.  I am satisfied that the wife&#8217;s current search for new employment will bear fruit in short order.  However, notwithstanding her current income and her earning capacity, the task of achieving a secure housing position will take longer. I also bear in mind that wife will be required to prioritise the children until they reach their later teenage years, which may impact on the speed at which she is able to adjust to her new circumstances.    Within this context, and doing the best I can, I am satisfied that the term of the &#8216;safety net&#8217; that comprises a nominal spousal maintenance order should be a period of six years.  At the conclusion of that period the wife will have had, within the context of her extensive qualifications and her earning capacity as I have found it to be, a sufficient period of time to further develop her career and to secure housing provision and the youngest child will be approaching his majority.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.01in">I am further satisfied that it is appropriate to order the husband to pay child periodical payments of &#163;4,000 per annum per child.  For the reasons I have already given, I do not consider it appropriate to make an order that exceeds the husband&#8217;s resources such that he would be required to rely on the largesse of others in order to meet it.  Likewise, I do not consider it appropriate to compel the husband to borrow money to meet his obligations.  However, I am satisfied having regard to his revised budget that the husband can do more at this point in time with regard to meeting the outgoings consequent upon raising the children than is provided for by his open position.  On his figures he has a surplus net income of &#163;3,648.  Within this context, I am satisfied that he can afford to pay &#163;4,000 per annum per child and that such a figure is appropriate having regard to outgoings in respect of the children. I note again the assurance provided to the husband by his parents that they will continue to pay the school fees and medical expenses of the children.  With respect to the term of the child periodical payments order, I am satisfied that the order should continue for each child until they attain the age of 18 years or cease their fulltime tertiary education to first degree level including a gap year, whichever shall be the later. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Finally, as set out above, Mr Leech rightly reminds the court that it has no power to compel the ADB to enlarge its offer to the wife, which offer involves the purchase of a property in London in the sum of &#163;1.5M with a right to occupy the same until the youngest child finishes his first degree.  Within this context and given the orders that this court considers it is able to make, it will now be a matter for the wife to decide whether to take advantage of the proposal maintained by the ADB.  A proposal that would enable the wife to reside in London rent and mortgage free over a period of some twelve years, during which extended period (and, as I have determined above, over a shorter timeframe within that period) she would, I have absolutely no doubt, be well able to achieve for her herself a position of financial independence, including adequate provision for future accommodation. </p>

I make an order varying the post nuptial settlement to provide the wife and the children with a licence to occupy the former matrimonial home terminable on six months notice, a nominal spousal maintenance order and a child periodical payments order in the sum of &#163;4,000 per annum per child.  I will receive submissions, if any, on the question of costs. </p>

She undertook that role with grace and represented my family well, for which I am grateful to her.&#8221;  At its heart, this is simply a sad case about a young couple who determined to marry for love despite the considerable challenges posed by the way in which history, tradition and chance had conspired to define their respective social status and to shape attitudes towards their marriage.  It is a case about a couple who thereafter, for a time, were happy together, before the fairy tale soured.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The fact that the wife chose in these circumstances to pursue financial remedies, as is her right in accordance with the law, does not act to equate her with those people who cynically form relationships with partners in order to obtain money or status.  Although a legitimate exercise of the right to freedom of expression, and whilst the point does not fall formally for me to determine, on the detailed evidence that has been available to me I take the view that the manner in which the wife has been traduced in some sections of the press by the use of that malign characterisation is both unfair and unwarranted. </p>
