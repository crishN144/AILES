I&#160;note in passing that Miss Demery has only been the guardian since August 2014 and that she is the fourth person to occupy this position.  Since this litigation began the second guardian, Sharon Garner, left the employment of CAFCASS earlier this year, and the third guardian, Sharon Warren, who was intended to replace Sharon Garner and see the case through to the end, but unfortunately fell ill at some stage during the summer and was unable to continue and was replaced by Miss Demery.   </span></p>

With her agreement, and the agreement of everybody else in the case I&#160;shall adopt the practice of calling her "MN" in the course of this Judgment.  She is a half-sister to B.  She has throughout been a litigant in person in these proceedings and, while her case may have been advanced a little differently had she been represented, I&#160;am satisfied that she has been able to articulate her views on relevant issues with clarity and certainty.  Indeed, as I&#160;shall say in due course, part of her evidence I&#160;felt she delivered with a rather shocking lack of guile, which I&#160;shall develop in due course.   </span></p>

All parties, including the father, have indicated that they wish the hearing to continue notwithstanding his absence, and this reflects the fact that, in fact, he does not offer himself as a carer for B, and supports MN&#8217;s position in every way, both as a carer and in the court litigation.

I&#160;have also seen some additional material to which my attention was drawn in the course of the hearing which, whilst not being in the core bundle, has been part of earlier court bundles.  I&#160;have been able to hear the oral evidence of the mother, of MN, of Sarah Ward, the social worker from Lambeth, of Loraine Hudson, the contact manager/supervisor at the Cassell Contact Centre, and also from the guardian.  I&#160;have had submissions from all parties, partly in writing and partly orally.  I&#160;have also seen a bundle of photographs presented to me by the mother, mostly taken by her, of B on contact visits over a number of years.  She must remind me to hand that back before we conclude today.</span></p>

His marriage to MN&#8217;s mother broke down when she was a child and she remained thereafter in his care until she grew up and she is very close and loyal to him.  Her own mother lives in Nigeria and she remains in touch with her. MN and the father both ended up living in England and, although I&#160;am not sure I&#160;have been given the exact date, my impression was that this was established quite a long time ago, probably when MN was a young child.  </span></p>

At about the same time the mother was diagnosed as HIV positive.  This was not contracted from any contact with the father, as he is known not to be HIV positive and, happily, it was not passed on to B.  Mother has subsequently been under medical care in the UK and modern medical treatment for HIV being what it is it seems not to have had very much impact on her day to day life.  More significantly for this case the diagnosis seems to have been the triggering event for the father to begin to take a very, very dim view of the mother; that view developed, but a good deal of that hostility developed in the early stages of their relationship before even B was born, and all the evidence before me now suggests that his fixed hostile contemptuous view of the mother's character and abilities developed in 2006 and is as strong now, eight years on, as it ever was.  Notwithstanding that, B was born on 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> August 2007 and in the period between August 2007 and May 2009 the mother had the care of B. </span></p>

I&#160;have counted at least 20 in The Family Court, as well as various judicial review applications arising out of mother's housing and immigration status.  District Judge Walker's order, however, was eventually made on 10</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February 2014, and it was for a residence order in favour of MN, with the mother having visiting only contact essentially on alternate Saturdays from 10 am to 5 pm.  This represented a substantial victory for the case put by the father and MN, in particular the refusal of overnight staying contact.  There are some features of District Judge Walker's reasoning which are worthy of comment at this stage.  First, notwithstanding some fairly positive opinions on mother's immigration position by the immigration expert (instructed on a single-joint expert basis) that is Nadine Finch, who said this:</span></p>

The fact that B is settled here and is also entitled to be registered as a British Citizen is likely to have a significant effect on the likelihood of the applicant being granted leave to remain here in the future.  The applicant has a strong bond with B and therefore her removal from the United Kingdom, after a residence or a contact order has been made, is likely to be a breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  If B is registered as a British citizen the applicant will be entitled to leave to remain under para.EX 1 of Annex FM to the Immigration Rules."</span></p>

They refer to the 'Catch 22' that the mother is in as having seen the position statements from the Guardian the family courts are reluctant to make any final decision while immigration matters are outstanding.  It was said by counsel on behalf of the father that it is not only the uncertainty caused by mother's immigration status that causes difficulties, but problems of her current status.  </span></p>

I&#160;do not accept that is the right approach.  Ms. Finch's opinion is just that, it is an opinion and however learned an expert there can be no certainty that is what the outcome will be.  The law, both Statute and case law may change and it would be in my view quite wrong for the court to make a finding that it is likely that mother will be able to stay.  There is a risk that she will not ultimately secure settled status and even if that risk is low the consequences for B if the mother were to be removed and he had to go with her would be damaging.  I&#160;would not expect mother to want to leave without him, although that is possible  but given B&#8217;s own secure immigration status the father and MN might launch proceedings to prevent him from going thereby creating a further period of uncertainty."</span></p>

Insofar as that is not agreed I&#160;find that to be the case on the evidence that I&#160;have heard.  It seems to me with B&#8217;s immigration status, with Nadine Finch's view of that, and from the parameters of the arguments before me, it seems to me, on a balance of probabilities, that in due course she will receive leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  Certainly, it would be my view, as it was the view of District Judge Walker, that it would be in B&#8217;s interest if that were to be the case. </span></p>

In effect, he decided that B&#8217;s best interests would be served by taking on directly and clearly the ultimatum laid down by MN.  Plainly, he expected MN to co-operate with staying contact.  Originally, he listed the case for himself for a final hearing in late 2014 at which he plainly planned to decide whether the circumstances were such that B might now move to live with his mother.  No doubt, he hoped to look at the development of staying contact over that period of time.  </span></p>

He told me he was and looked to the Second Respondent [MN] asking if he should go.  [MN] asked B why he was asking her because she said he had told her that he did not want to go with me.  B replied saying that he promised he would come back if he went with me. [MN] said plainly that she had already told him that if he goes,  he is not coming back.  There was some repetition between B and MN at this point in which he was promising to return and she was telling him he could not come back if he went.  I&#160;reassured B and told him to go and change.  He stated directly to [MN] that he would go with me but that he promised to come back and that he would not sleep over. [MN] asked B if he was sure he wanted to go with me and he said yes before turning to climb the stairs to change.  As B was about to go up,[MN] asked me if I&#160;would return B at 5.00 pm.  I&#160;told her that if he changed his mind and wanted to stay overnight then I&#160;would let him but I&#160;would bring him back if not.  She responded angrily, she would not therefore let B leave and she told B not to go and change.  [MN] told me that she would be working at 5.00 pm and she would not be available to telephone the police to have B brought back if I&#160;did not return him.  She repeated getting the police involved several times in the presence of both B and her daughter, N, who was also in earshot.  I&#160;told her it was not appropriate to keep mentioning the police in the presence of the children.  B then asked if he could say something to which MN responded initially by telling him to go upstairs and not to say a word.  She then changed her mind and told him to say what it was he wanted to say.  B said he was confused. He said he did not know who his real mummy was and that he had not yet decided.  He said he found it difficult to make a decision to go for a sleepover because it would upset MN, but if he did not go that &#8216;G&#8217; would be upset.  [MN] told B that as he has a new guardian she could decide.  This is in direct breach of the Order which had been made less than a month before. However, I&#160;was really concerned by B&#8217;s reaction and whilst I&#160;could see that he wanted to stay over with me, I&#160;did not want him to feel pressured any further so decided it was best to leave.  I&#160;told B that I&#160;loved him very much, that I&#160;would always be his mummy and no matter what, I&#160;would always love him.  I&#160;offered pleasantries to [MN] and left."</span></p>

I&#160;asked him later in the conversation                                            if he is beaten with a cane, he replied he was, and that his carer also shouts at him and tells him to go to bed, and he will not wake up.  In my professional opinion this little boy is possibly experiencing both emotional and physical abuse by his carer. There is a court order for the birth mother to have overnight contact with B, however his carer is resistant to this and has threatened to relinquish responsibility for him.  My concern is for B, to keep him safe whilst he remains in her care.  I&#160;do not know how MN will behave towards him when she discovers what he has said.

It seemed that he had either been coached or had overheard inappropriate adult conversations.  I&#160;have clearly explained that it is inappropriate and illegal to use an implement and that physical chastisement is not an effective sanction.  MN has denied using a cane, however, has signed a written agreement indicating that she will not resort to this. Based on this, it is my preliminary view that this case should transfer to a Long Term Child in Need team.  This would mean that an allocated social worker would have ongoing oversight of his emotional well-being and would be able to provide B with ongoing support.   The Local Authority is also able to offer specialist parenting classes to all parties.  This would mean that they would provide her with education in respect of child development, issues of identity, attachment and relationship, and the need for B to receive consistent nurturing care from all those who care for him.  The allocated social worker could reinforce this through direct work. It is also my view that B would benefit from therapeutic intervention.  He has presented to professionals as confused about his parenting.   As he grows and develops he needs to understand his circumstances and have strategies is to manage the pleadings that he will have.  Based on the information I&#160;have at this time I&#160;am of the view that B should remain living with MN and her husband.  His basic care is good and he speaks highly of his family.  I&#160;believe to remove him would be detrimental to is emotional wellbeing."</span></p>

It seems to me inconceivable that a guardian would invent such a thing.  In any event, it was repeated, at least in part, to Sara Ward the social worker, and the sentiment of the comments i.e. acute hostility to staying contact and the consequences of not returning to her home if he does have overnight contact, accurately and with power represents the view held by MN, and held by her very strongly.   Also, this is not the first time that B has made allegations involving an element of corporal punishment, there are some references earlier in the papers, C35 and C57, and at this point I&#160;will not go back to them.   </span></p>

He made an order which required there to be three specific sessions at the Cassell Contact Centre, the third of which was to involve the guardian.  In contrast to what I&#160;have just been talking about the first of these three occasions, on 23</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">rd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July 2014, went ahead.  I&#160;was able to hear compelling evidence about this event from the contact manager, whose name is Loraine Hudson.   She told me a number of things.  She commented that MN made little effort to encourage the contact to take place, that on this occasion B did not require very much persuasion to go on the contact.  The contact went well.  It was a happy occasion.  He was pleased to see his mother.  He got on well with his mother, also his friend, M, who lives in the same house as the mother does, and that although, in the course of the trip to the park, he fell and had a small graze, that was, in Loraine Hudson's view, a very minor matter which no reasonable person could say led  to any blame.  Loraine Hudson reported in her written report that at the end of the contact session B was happy and excitedly told of the fun that he had, and that he took, indeed, some encouragement to return back to MN as he wished to continue to play with his friend and to talk with his mother.  He was pacified on departure at the news that he would see his mother and M again the following week.  She says once B had met with his mother and his friend he was quite keen to spend time with them in the park.  </span></p>

It fits with the photographs that I&#160;have seen, as provided by the mother.  I&#160;am always cognisant when I&#160;see photographs that one has to treat them with care because they are only literally a snapshot of events which could hide a different presentation.  But, with those caveats, I&#160;am satisfied that this contact, as with many other previous contacts, went extremely well and that B was very happy to be with his mother.  Yet, MN could not bring herself to accept that there were any benefits in this.  She very grudgingly in her evidence before me said that it was just because M was there that he enjoyed his contact.  Whilst it is true she was there, I&#160;reject that explanation. I&#160;regard this contact as providing good evidence of B having a good, underlying loving relationship with his mother when he is left with space to do so.  Since that date there has been no contact at all.</span></p>

On that occasion the manager decided not to force the issue. The notes provide little evidence of any encouragement by MN.  We have to remember that just a week earlier B, as I&#160;have already said, had not wanted contact to end, yet here he is a week later expressing apparently a strong hostile view about his mother. </span></p>

She was present, and she has described what happened, and to summarise she observed B in tears, getting out of the car, he tried to run away, refusing to have contact saying: "No, no, I&#160;don't want to go."  It was a very fraught situation.  She noted in her written report that at no point did MN offer any encouragement to B to see his mother.  She, like the manager on the previous occasion, felt it could not be pushed on that occasion and so there was no contact.  It is my view, having heard all of the evidence about these events, that B&#8217;s resistance to contact on 30</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July and 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> August had nothing whatsoever to do with a small graze which he had suffered on 23</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">rd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July.

Having heard MN&#8217;s evidence I&#160;do not doubt that she conveyed to him her true hostile views about the mother, both clearly and directly, and that MN is responsible for B&#8217;s attitude on those occasions.  I&#160;regard these instances as further illustrations of a grave absence of insight by MN into B&#8217;s emotional needs with, again, a substantial risk of causing him significant emotional harm.  Indeed, the combination of these events from May 2014 onwards caused me to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that B has already been caused significant emotional harm, with the risk that if I&#160;do nothing it will continue and get worse.  He is a confused and unhappy little boy. In my view this is as a direct result of MN&#8217;s behaviour towards him.   </span></p>

It is important for me to track how things have changed over the last five days.  At the outset of this hearing the positions of the various interested persons were as follows.  MN and the father wished to revert to the order of District Judge Walker of 10</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February 2014, i.e. for B to live with MN, with visiting contact only to the mother.  The mother wished there to be an immediate transfer of B&#8217;s arrangements so that he would be living with his mother, with contact arrangements to the father and MN to be arranged.  Her primary case was that this should happen outright with an immediate handover to her care, but her secondary position was that I&#160;should make orders under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.37</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.38</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, with the effect that B would be placed into the care of the Local Authority under an interim care order with a plan for immediate removal to a foster placement, though work to be done to bring about, as soon as it could be achieved, the transfer of B&#8217;s living arrangements to the mother. </span></p>

They, via, Miss Ward or her successor, would implement a Child in Need Plan, with the intention of working with MN over a period of time to bring about the transition.  They felt there were possibilities for working with MN and persuading her to work with them, doing some constructive life story work with her, leading on to her support for a gradual transition of the living arrangements of B from her to the mother.  </span></p>

On day one Sara Ward gave her evidence in accordance with the Local Authority view at that time.  Everything she said in her evidence supported the proposition which I&#160;have just mentioned, which was the Local Authority's opening stance.  She went off at the end of day one and at that point we did not expect to see her again.  On day two MN gave her evidence.  The guardian is a very experienced guardian with nearly 30 years of professional practice doing children's cases.  She plainly has come across many adults in that time with implacable positions, but she listened to MN&#8217;s evidence, and it plainly had a profound effect on her view of the case.  It would be fair to say that one can trace a change in her view from the written version in her report to her evidence subsequent to hearing MN&#8217;s evidence, and she has been criticised for changing her mind as a result of that.  I&#160;do not criticise her for that at all.  </span></p>

If there was overnight staying contact I&#160;would not look after B.  I&#160;would just then be a child minder, I&#160;would just be an unpaid child minder.  If you find that there should be overnight contact then it will follow that my view is that B should go and live with his mother.  If an overnight contact order is made I&#160;would relinquish care.  It would be a hard thing to do but I&#160;have to think of my family and my daughter. I&#160;really do not like the mother. I&#160;believe she sexually abused B.  It is a sexually deviant thing for her to do what she did to B.  I&#160;think District Judge Walker got that wrong.  I&#160;have a good relationship with my father; I&#160;will take his side.  I&#160;do not agree with Judge Walker on her findings on sexual behaviour.  Nothing you say will persuade me that the mother did not the cause of B&#8217;s sexualised behaviour.  It is clear that all she wants is her immigration status sorted out.  It is all because of her immigration status.  I&#160;feel that she will abandon B as soon as she gets her immigration status sorted out.  I&#160;would not be prepared to look after B in that scenario.  I&#160;agree it is not a responsible decision.  I&#160;have to say what is right to protect my family.  B would be exposed to sexualised behaviour and, having learned that, he would come back to my house and would pollute my daughter.  I&#160;cannot take the risk.  If it happened and he went I&#160;would not be comfortable. I&#160;would not have that boy in my house again.  I&#160;am owed gratitude.

If he wants to see me, yes, fine, but I&#160;would not have him overnight in my house.   If the decision was that I&#160;was to relinquish his care under a planned transfer I&#160;would not co-operate.  Once he had overnight contact that would be it, he would not be able to come back to my home.  He calls me 'mum', he grew up in my house. I&#160;gave him the care.

She recommended that the social worker should be told about this and should be asked to come back and reconsider her position.

She was not dismissive of what the guardian had said, but wanted further opportunity to explore whether what she had said is right.  She felt, given a meeting between her and MN, and MN&#8217;s husband, CN, that there was a real possibility she could bring them around and recruit them to working on her 'softly softly' transition plan.  Going beyond the call of duty she agreed to meet them after hours on Wednesday evening.  That meeting happened early on Wednesday evening, and Sara Ward came, once again, back to the court on Thursday morning.  She told me about what had happened the night before.   It was clear by Thursday morning that her optimism that MN&#8217;s husband, CN, would exert a sensible calming influence on the situation had not been borne out.  His view was every bit as extreme as MN&#8217;s.  In short, his view was that the mother was a promiscuous individual, had been sexually abusive to B and would be so again.  If there was any overnight contact he would not be welcome in their house and they would not co-operate in any transition work at all.   </span></p>

The father and MN have not changed their position, save that they say that if I&#160;am contemplating any kind of removal I&#160;should not order this without obtaining expert evidence from a child psychologist or a child psychiatrist first.  Unless I&#160;agree with the order of District Judge Walker being reinstated they seek an adjournment of the case for me not to deliver any Judgment at all, and they seek my direction for expert evidence to be obtained. </span></p>

The Local Authority were not offering to pay for that.   The Local Authority view, however, is that if I&#160;do agree with the guardian and the mother about a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.38</ref> order, that they would sign up to a care plan incorporating immediate removal into Local Authority foster care, and they would facilitate this.

There seems to be little challenge in this case to the proposition that both the mother and MN could meet B&#8217;s physical and educational needs.  The issue in this case really relates to emotional needs.  In my view B needs to have the opportunity to have a good and full and developing relationship with his mother.  This is his European Convention Article 8 right, but it does not really need Article 8 to spell it out, it is a matter of common sense.  Absent some real problem with his mother any child has a right to have a relationship with her and, given the funds I&#160;have mentioned, there is no reason why that should not be the case here.  Indeed, having seen the mother giving evidence at some length I&#160;was impressed by her warmth, sensitivity and intelligence, and I&#160;did not recognise the picture of her painted by MN.   There is no reason why she should have a full relationship with B and every reason why she should do so.  The present arrangements, entirely by reason of MN&#8217;s behaviour, and even more so since May 2014, are not permitting this.  </span></p>

If the court should be reluctant to allow the implacable hostility of a parent to deter it from making a contact order, how much more should a court be reluctant to allow the implacable hostility of someone who is not a parent to deter it from making a contact order?  I&#160;am entirely satisfied that B&#8217;s relationship with MN and the father will be much more appropriately promoted by mother if B is with her than MN and father have promoted B&#8217;s relationship with mother under their, or particularly under MN&#8217;s care.  I&#160;am afraid that in view of all the matters I&#160;have set out above leaving B with MN runs the very real risk of his suffering very substantial emotional damage, more of the sort that, sadly, he has already suffered.

There is a legitimate area for concern about how a change of circumstances, that is a move to mother's care would impact on B.  He has lived with MN for a long time and any move is likely to create uncertainty and distress for him.  The instinct of the guardian and the Local Authority and, indeed, mine initially at the outset of this case, was this might be most sensitively handled over a period of time.  Surely, MN was a sensible enough person to work together in B&#8217;s best interests so as to limit the dangers arising from a change in circumstances?  Surely, with appropriate life story work and other therapeutic input that change could, over a period of time, be made easier for B?  I&#160;am afraid MN&#8217;s attitude has really ruled out the possibility of a gradual change.  It is abundantly clear that MN and her husband will not work with it and will simply undermine it.  That is unfortunate, and I&#160;need to consider what mechanism to adopt.  It is unfortunate that this increases the possibility that a change in circumstances will have a harmful effect.  However, taking into account all of those circumstances, weighing one with another I&#160;have reached the very clear conclusion that the factors I&#160;have discussed above point inexorably to B&#8217;s best interests being served by B moving to live with his mother as soon as that can be arranged. </span></p>

I&#160;am satisfied that the judge approached her decision on that basis.  In paragraph 75, on two occasions, she states that the mother 'cannot safely' have unsupervised contact to the younger boys and that it would be 'unsafe' for them to spend Christmas with the mother and her family. The determination of the factual allegations on 23rd December was itself a dynamic event. Given the mother's previous track record, as found by the judge, the court was entitled to consider whether that dynamic event, the making of the findings of fact, materially altered the potential for the children to suffer emotional harm if they were to remain in the care of the mother. The judge's conclusion was that it did and that they could not remain with her, or even have unsupervised contact to her at that stage.</span></p>

The history of this case, and my assessment of MN as set out throughout this Judgment points inexorably to the clear conclusion that MN is not going to stop trying to influence B after this decision.  Indeed, now she knows what my Judgment says she has every reason for increasing her efforts and the pressure on him could be very detrimental indeed and could, as the guardian said, undermine the very plan which she advocates and I&#160;have decided is the right one.  I&#160;am entirely satisfied, on the basis of the evidence that I&#160;have heard, in particular supported by the guardian's evidence, with all the background evidence that I&#160;have gone into, that this step is proportionate to the need to safeguard the child's welfare on an interim basis.  I&#160;am satisfied that it is supported on the evidence.

I&#160;am conscious of the fact that there is a tendency in family law to see an outcome such as this as a panacea, one-size fits all solution. I&#160;emphasise that this is not the case, indeed, this Judgment comes with a series of strong health warnings.  Firstly, of course, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.37</ref>, which I&#160;have set out above, can only be used if the facts of the case meet its criteria.  It must appear to the court that it may be appropriate for a care or supervision order to be made with respect to the children in question.  In other words, at the very lowest the court must be satisfied there are reasonable grounds for believing that the circumstances with respect to the children meet the threshold criteria under s.31(2), that is to say the children are suffering or are likely to suffer significant harm.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 37</ref> is accordingly a well-focused tool to be used only where the case fits its criterion.  It is sometimes forgotten that the court has the power to make an interim care order when it gives directions under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.37</ref>.

It can only be used as a temporary measure to safeguard the child's welfare.  If immediate removal is being considered, as it is, then I&#160;need to take into account a number of principles.  The decision taken by the court must necessarily be limited to the issues that cannot await the final hearing.  Separation is only to be ordered if the child's safety demands immediate attention.  I&#160;remind myself that justification of this standard must meet a high standard. I&#160;need to be satisfied that the children's safety requires interim protection and I, of course, remind myself of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human rights: Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life.</span></p>
