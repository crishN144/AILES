By Article 320 of the Italian Civil Code the formal acceptance must be made by an adult (usually a parent) and authorised by a tutelary judge who makes decisions on behalf of persons such as minors who do not have formal capacity. In the case of a minor, the acceptance can only be under the first of the two prescribed procedures (the inheritance inventory). The tutelary judge must be satisfied that the authorisation is both necessary and in the best interests of the minor. Once this is done, the minor (in this case AC) becomes the legal owner of his inheritance (in this case 25% of the Property).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">Sub paragraph (1) is very widely drafted.  I do not read into it any restriction to its applicability.  It is all encompassing and should be construed purposively. Of particular note in this case is the emphasis on responsibilities as well as rights.  Thus, M has a clear <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">responsibility</span> under (1) to act in AC&#8217;s interests in relation to property to which he is entitled. By (2) and (3) M has not only rights and powers, but also <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">duties</span> to take steps to receive or recover property for the benefit of the child.  The wording of (2) and (3) plainly embraces the Property in this case, being a house in Italy in which AC has an entitlement. And in my judgment a purposive reading of subsections (1) to (3) also includes the responsibility and duty of the person with responsibility to take steps which enable the child to receive or recover property in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">the child&#8217;s own name</span>, and not merely enabling the person with parental responsibility to receive or recover property <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">in</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">his or her own name </span>for the benefit of the child.

In <span style="font-weight:bold">Hays v Hays <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2015/3825" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 3825 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 3825 (Ch)</ref> </span>Master Matthews (as he then was), sitting in the Chancery Division, was faced with a similar factual situation.  After the death of her father, and pursuant to French succession law, the minor child held an interest in a French apartment.  The child&#8217;s mother applied for an order to be appointed as agent for the child in order to enter into a contract for sale. The application was put forward in a number of ways, including as an exercise of parental responsibility under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s3</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  The Master granted the order sought on the basis of private international law enabling him, sitting in an English court, to apply French law.  The application accordingly succeeded. But, and of interest to those who practise in the field of Family Law, he concluded that he had no power to grant the relief sought under the Children Act, saying:  </p>

But I am not aware of any case law or other authority (and none was cited to me) to the effect that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s3</ref> authorises the Defendant to dispose of Estelle&#8217;s immovable property rights.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/3/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S3(3)</ref> in particular refers expressly to her being able to give a good receipt or sue for property belonging to the minor, as if that might otherwise be in doubt (cf Re Chatard&#8217;s Settlement <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1899] 1 Ch 712" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1899">[1899] 1 Ch 712</ref>).

Taken as a whole, I am not satisfied at present that this section confers powers on those exercising parental authority to enter into a contract to sell immovable property on behalf of a minor. </p>

I am asked solely to authorise acceptance of his inheritance by her. <span style="font-weight:bold">Hays v Hays</span> is therefore not strictly on point and I have no hesitation in concluding that, on the facts of this case, acceptance of inheritance falls comfortably within the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s3</ref> definition. It is plainly the receipt or recovery of property to which the child is entitled.  Acceptance of inheritance does not amount to a disposal of property which was the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s3</ref> issue before Master Matthews.     </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0in">It may be that once the inheritance is accepted, M will apply for authorisation to enter into a contract of sale of AC&#8217;s share of the Property, in which case the dicta in <span style="font-weight:bold">Hays v Hays</span> will need to be revisited.  I have not received full submissions on this point; that will have to await another day. But my initial view is that the Master&#8217;s interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s3</ref> was, with respect, too restrictive.  If, in this case, M is not authorised to enter into a contract of sale on behalf of AC, then AC will not be able in a meaningful sense to receive or recover his property until he is 18.  Of course, he will hold it, but he will be prevented from converting it into other assets which can be managed, invested or deployed in his interests.  I would regard a contract of sale in such circumstances as arguably falling within the phrase &#8220;entitled to receive or recover&#8221;. In any event, sub<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section (3</ref>) states that the rights referred to in subsection (2) &#8220;include&#8221; the right to receive or recover.  The word &#8220;include&#8221; does not operate as a limit to the powers relating to property, which powers in my provisional view include disposal of property.  It offers one particular example of circumstances in which the power may be exercised (probably aimed at trust arrangements commonplace in England but not encountered in many foreign jurisdictions) but does not limit the power to that example. I see no reason why <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s3</ref>, read as a whole, should not be construed more widely to encompass entering into a contract of sale provided, of course, that the welfare checklist and paramountcy principle govern the exercise of that power.  </p>

For the avoidance of any doubt, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s8</ref> provision, insofar as it is invoked to address an issue concerning the property of a child, does not entitle the court to make financial provision orders; those matters must be litigated under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> and/or Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.   </p>

It is plainly in the interests of AC to have the issue of his heirship in Italy resolved to his financial benefit.  There is no disadvantage to him in making the order whereas the risk of leaving his heirship status hanging unresolved if the order is not made by me is all too obvious. There are no debts which he will become liable for. The application enables AC to receive property to which he is entitled. M has fully and faithfully discharged her parental responsibility in bringing the application. </p>

Under Italian law, the contract for sale cannot be executed until such time as the inheritances of M and AC are formally accepted.  My order should enable AC&#8217;s inheritance to be accepted.  As with acceptance of the inheritance, I may then be invited to make further orders authorising M to execute the contract of sale on AC&#8217;s behalf. I am not asked to make such orders today.  The matter shall be referred back to me if orders are sought specific to the sale of the Property. </p>
