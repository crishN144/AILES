For her part, the mother maintained that the child struggled with the contact arrangements and was not always willing to go to the father.

There is no room for a finding that it might have happened. The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened or it did not. If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened '<img src="image4.jpg" style="width:3.36pt;height:8.16pt"/></p>
