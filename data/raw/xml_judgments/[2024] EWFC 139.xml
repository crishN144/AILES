He points out that that is not the right test.  However, when I look at the totality of Cafcass evidence in writing and in the witness box, it is very clear to me the officer is firmly focused on the children&#8217;s welfare and that her report picks up the factors of the welfare checklist.  Although she has not slavishly recited the welfare checklist and she has not peppered her report with the word &#8220;welfare&#8221;, that does not mean her report is unreliable.  The children&#8217;s welfare and the checklist pervade her work, in my view.

There was evidence he continued to blame the victim for his behaviour and lacked good empathy.

I undertake my own balancing of risk and benefit.  The benefit is of face-to-face relationship with the father and an ability to play more easily.  They would have an appreciation of cultural heritage and language.  That would be best for the children to see their father face-to-face as long as it is safe.

If the father does not engage with domestic abuse work or do it in a meaningful way, there is a risk that the children will later on suffer the loss of their relationship with their father if the contact stopped or it did not progress.</span></p>

The father has not managed the boundaries of contact at present for the children and the evidence suggests that he will be dissatisfied until he gets what he wants.  This coercion is subtle and cumulative and difficult for a contact supervisor to stop.  The risk could, of course, be mitigated by the father doing a domestic abuse programme but he is not eligible for that because he does not accept he has done anything wrong.

He did not pick up Dr&#160;Derry&#8217;s suggestions about contact or make sure that he understood this expert report, which I am sure his legal team explained to him.

There is a risk this would become an obligation to the children.  Dr&#160;Derry observed it is hard for the father to engage them without a coercive strategy and that is worrying because if he becomes frustrated with them in contact that contact may break down over time.  He was clear in his evidence that if the contact does not progress it cannot continue like this, i.e. on the video link and he gave a clear welfare-based reason: that children will lose interest.  The onus is on the mother in indirect video contact to make sure it happens and that it is enjoyable so when the father is talking about chocolate, she produces it.  She is in effect supervising the children, which puts her in a very vulnerable position if she needs to challenge anything said or done.  Of course, the father does not appear under the influence of alcohol in these video calls but that is another risk that any person facilitating video contact would need to be alive to and I think it is unfair on the mother to monitor this.</span></p>

It allows the father to send pictures of Norway, to tell them about his heritage and to share information about their school and their drawings and reports (redacted if necessary) could be sent to him.  Letters can be kept and read and reread and opened when the children get older to read yet again.

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in">&#8220;There is not, however, nor should there be, any presumption that on proof of domestic violence the offending parent has to surmount a prima facie barrier of no contact.&#160; As a matter of principle, domestic violence of itself cannot constitute a bar to contact.&#160; It is one factor in the difficult and delicate balancing exercise of discretion. The court deals with the facts of a specific case in which the degree of violence and the seriousness of the impact on the child and on the resident parent have to be taken into account. In cases of proved domestic violence, as in cases of other proved harm or risk of harm to the child, the court has the task of weighing in the balance the seriousness of the domestic violence, the risks involved and the impact on the child against the positive factors (if any), of contact between the parent found to have been violent and the child. In this context, the ability of the offending parent to recognise his past conduct, be aware of a need to change, and make genuine efforts to do so, will be likely to be an important consideration.&#8221;</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in">Further, the guidelines do not say that a s91(14) order should only be made in exceptional circumstances, rather Guideline 4 says such an order should be the &#8216;exception and not the rule&#8217;. That is of course right, there is no place in our child focused family justice system for any sort of &#8216;two strikes and you are out&#8217; approach, but it seems to me that in the changed landscape described in paragraph 30 above there is considerable scope for the greater use of this protective filter in the interests of children. Those interests are served by the making of an order under s91(14) in an appropriate case not only to protect an individual child from the effects of endless unproductive applications and/or a campaign of harassment by the absent parent, but tangentially also to benefit all those other children whose cases are delayed as court lists are clogged up by the sort of applications made in this case, applications which should never have come before a judge.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in">In my judgment in many cases, but particularly in those cases where the judge forms the view that the type of behaviour indulged in by one of the parents amounts to &#8216;lawfare&#8217;, that is to say the use of the court proceedings as a weapon of conflict, the court may feel significantly less reluctance than has been the case hitherto, before stepping in to provide by the making of an order under s91(14), protection for a parent from what is in effect, a form of coercive control on their former partner&#8217;s part.&#8221;</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.5in">&#8220;&#8230;Correctly applied to a child's circumstances, section 91A(2) gives a court greater latitude to make section 91(14) orders than the Re P guidelines do. Thus, in coming to my decision in this case, I have applied the new statutory approach to harm set out in s.91A(2) rather than guideline 7 of the Re P guidelines and, in so doing, I have adopted the ordinary civil standard of proof. That course is consistent with the modern approach of the Court of Appeal in Re A as outlined above.&#8221;</p>
