	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have taken the step of publishing the two judgments in one document for two principal reasons.  First, because they raise questions of principle and public importance in respect of litigation involving serious allegations of child sexual abuse. Second, in furtherance of the President of the Family&#160;Division&#8217;s transparency initiative and the &#8220;the need for much greater openness&#8221; in the Family Courts (<span style="font-style:italic">Confidence and Confidentiality: Transparency in the Family Courts</span>, 28 October 2021, [20]-[32]), so members of the public may see how the court performs its protective duties towards a child where one parent alleges that the other has sexually abused their child - here a father against his daughter.  The essential facts are common to both applications; that is another reason to provide this consolidated judicial overview.</p>

To make these complicated proceedings more readily intelligible, I further subdivide the text into 12 sections.  </p>

I am grateful to all the advocates listed.  I wish in particular to note the contribution of Ms Ecob, who made two bold applications in the best interests of her lay client, the mother.  Of no less note are Ms Cooke and Mr Anderson.  They acted pro bono on behalf of the father.  It does them and the Bar great credit.  Equally, the court must pay tribute to their instructing solicitor Ms Shah, who again acted for the father on a pro bono basis.  It is important that the public knows the professional and personal sacrifice that members of the legal profession so frequently make, unheralded and unacknowledged, and without which many cases could not proceed effectively or would take significantly longer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a generally circulating misconception that there is a common approach to costs in the Family Court, and that it is that generally costs orders are not made.  In fact, the position is more complex and nuanced than that.  There are a number of dominant themes that broadly shape but do not determine the various substreams of work that together constitute the work of the Family Court.  Proceedings under the Children&#160;Act&#160;1989 is one such stream; this work can be further subdivided into public law and private law work.  </p>

The court does not wish the spectre of an order for costs to discourage those with a proper interest in the child from participating in the debate.  Nor does it wish to reduce the chance of their cooperation around the future life of the child by casting one as the successful party entitled to his costs and another as the unsuccessful party obliged to pay them&#8230;  But the proposition is not applied where, for example, the conduct of a party has been reprehensible or the party's stance has been beyond the band of what is reasonable&#8221;.  </p>

It is those facts, once found, that then inform the welfare decisions of the court, but they are not in themselves about child welfare.  One tests that proposition by asking whether one makes a factual determination taking into account what is in the best welfare interests of the child or simply by assessing the evidence and then making a determination of what is proved to the requisite standard, irrespective of the implications for the destination of the child&#8217;s living and contact arrangements.</p>

At the final welfare hearing, the residence of the child was transferred from the mother to the father.  In a third judgment about proceedings, the judge considered the father&#8217;s application for costs. The judge carefully set out the legal framework and relevant decisions about it ([9]-[20]).  He found that the mother&#8217;s approach to proceedings, in which she had lied repeatedly, amounted to an &#8220;ill-judged litigation tactic&#8221; and was &#8220;so egregious&#8221; that it triggered the costs discretion.

The features that are relevant to this evaluation are as follows.  Here, there were 12&#160;allegations subdivided into two groups of six.  Of these 12&#160;allegations, the court found all 12 of them proved; the only finding that was not made was the court found that it was not sexually touching &#8220;many&#8221; times, but it was sexually touching &#8220;five&#8221; times.

There is no evidence before the court demonstrating an attachment between the father and G. Indeed, G has no memory of her father by reason of the termination of contact consequent upon the father's sexual offending. Likewise, there is no evidence before the court that the father has demonstrated the level of commitment to G that would support the making of a parental responsibility order. First, the father engaged in offending behaviour that was entirely antithetic to his continued safe and consistent involvement in G's upbringing and the exercise of parental responsibility for her. Second, the father has taken no steps since his convictions to address his offending behaviour or the risk he has been assessed to continue to present to adolescent children and former partners so as to permit safe contact and relationship building with G. I am satisfied that this speaks to a lack of commitment on the part of the father to his daughter. That conclusion is reinforced in my judgment by the fact that, third, within these proceedings the father has failed to engage, including failing to follow through on his stated intention to seek legal advice and apply for orders designed to reinstitute his relationship with G. In addition to these matters, having regard to the nature of the father's convictions, and the risk assessments that are before the court, I am satisfied that were he to have parental responsibility for G there is a significant risk he would seek to use it to seek to control the mother in the context of his historic harassment of her and other former partners. In circumstances where the mother would have to consult the father with respect to decision making for G if he had parental responsibility, having regard to the conduct for which the father has been convicted and cautioned and the risks identified that the father has in no way taken steps to mitigate I am further satisfied that this would be intolerable for the mother and would act to destabilise her, with a concomitant impact on the stability, safety and security of G.&#160;</span></p>

There must be exceptionality before a father&#8217;s parental responsibility can be removed. Here the father sexually abused his daughter and exploited a court order to do so.  He applied for a further child arrangements order knowing he had sexually abused his child.  He lied to the police repeatedly.  He lied to this court on oath repeatedly.  He sought to dispute the allegations of sexual abuse by gaslighting the mother and questioning her emotional and psychological stability.  I find exceptionality in this case.</p>

I have absolutely no doubt that if the father made an application for parental responsibility, it would be resoundingly refused.  It is inconceivable that any court properly seized with the facts of his systematic sexual abuse of his daughter, would grant him parental responsibility.  The court would be bound to consider &#8220;the evidence of attachment and degree of commitment&#8221; as MacDonald J put it in <span style="font-style:italic">D v E and G</span> at [52].  Notwithstanding that the father wishes to have his daughter remaining in his life, that must be balanced against her wish, strongly and emotionally expressed to CAFCASS, that she does not see him anymore.  Indeed, the prospect of future contact with her father is deeply distressing to her.  I judge that the true nature of the father&#8217;s commitment to his child cannot be judged just by the fine words of affection to her, but by his acts: the systematic and repeated sexual abuse.  I accept that he played a part in caring for her in the first few years of her life.  But he used that opportunity to exploit her.  He is concerned that termination of parental responsibility with result in the &#8220;erasure&#8221; of her memories of their life together.  One of the ongoing features of her life moving forward will be how and to what extent she can process the memories of being abused by her father.  Whether she will be able to erase such intrusive thoughts and whether that would be psychologically healthy is not a matter for this court now.  However, the question of memory erasure is complex and cuts sharply both ways.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-weight:bold">Prohibited steps order (combined with a section 91(14) order).  </span>I must carefully consider a chief plank of the father&#8217;s case: whether a prohibited steps order in combination with a section 91(14) order would provide sufficient protection.  The father states with complete factual accuracy that he has not sought to interfere with parenting decisions during the course of proceedings.  But this ignores a stark fact.  That is that these proceedings exist because of him in two distinct senses.  First, because he sexually abused his child which led to the distress of his daughter being reported to authorities.  Second, because despite that, he sought to have contact with her again by issuing private law proceedings.  Looking at the impact on her life, and fairly recognising his involvement in various ways in her early upbringing, I judge that by far the most significant impact he has had on her life viewed objectively at this point is his repeated sexual abuse.  This is something that will undoubtedly have a lasting and damaging impact on her. Presently, it is not possible to quantify it.  Her attitude towards her father, as expressed to the CAFCASS officer, speaks powerfully about how his abuse has damaged her attitude towards him.  He is the sole author of all this.  Yet not once during these proceedings has he shown the slightest insight or remorse.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Instead, he brazenly clings to his lies and repeats them. Following the court&#8217;s fact-finding judgment, the delivery of which he interrupted with intemperate and dishonest protestations; he sought to appeal on a basis that the High Court determined was totally without merit.  His actions towards his child have been exceptionally harmful.  The risk he poses to her in the future if he retains parental responsibility, even combined with a prohibited steps order, remains high.  He would retain the capacity to make applications to the court and inflict further uncertainty on the mother.  A section 91(14) order acts as a leave filtering requirement, but not an absolute bar (except very rarely).  I have seen at close quarters the tremendously damaging impact these proceedings have had on the mother.  These courts are increasingly aware of how such a damaging impact on a parent can affect the child through the impact on the parent&#8217;s emotional resources and availability.

I have no doubt that, separately from the direct impact on the child, the continuing distress caused to the mother by the father retaining parental responsibility is likely to adversely impact the child indirectly.  I find that the there is a significant risk of that happening here.  Once the spotlight of proceedings moves on, I have little confidence that this father would be able to restrain himself.  The fact that he brought these proceedings and then sought to appeal the court&#8217;s judgment on a spurious basis confirms that.  </p>

The principal point advanced on the father&#8217;s behalf is that retaining the father-daughter link will be of benefit to the child should she in future wish to resume her relationship with him. It was put in this way by Mr Anderson:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;The benefit to her is that if in future she seeks out her father, it would not be in the context of him knowing nothing about her, but he would have some minimal basis about his daughter, and that would provide a firmer foundation rather than coming from nothing.  If she does not seek out the contact, there is no detriment to her.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, what should happen in the interim?  Should the child be told the truth by her mother about whether her father was being kept informed about her life, if the child asked?  When pressed, counsel accepted that the child would have to be told the truth. This must be right.  The court cannot countenance the child being lied to.  It is necessary therefore to consider the impact of this on the child, given her firmly set views about not wishing to see her father. Mr Anderson, realistically, accepted that potentially this could cause her additional harm.  It strikes me that there are two problems with the course advocated by the father.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, whilst almost anything is theoretically possible, there is nothing concrete in the evidence to suggest that the child would seek out her father in future.  This possibility is highly speculative.  Second, one must weigh this remote future benefit against what is a real risk of future additional harm to the child.  It strikes me as disproportionate to retain parental responsibility on the basis of the remote eventuality of future contact and a desire not to start that from a &#8220;standing start&#8221;.  I cannot see how the situation would be materially improved with the combination of a section 91(14) barring order.  As said, it is not an absolute prohibition, but a leave requirement before further application by the father.  However, the mother would have to be informed of the application, and that in itself is likely to produce distress in her.  Moreover, the father still refuses to accept the findings of fact by the court.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father states that he would not oppose a section 91(14) order.  However, his stance strikes me as being inconsistent.  One of the reasons he wishes to retain parental responsibility is a professed concern that the child will be taken to the country of the mother&#8217;s birth.  But if he truly does not intend to interfere or participate in his daughter&#8217;s life while she is in her minority, and will not try to see her, that cannot be a matter of great concern to him.  What it does indicate is that despite his external stance, there is at least the risk of further attempted intervention in her life, which is the crux of the mother&#8217;s application.  This was an inadvertent pointer to his underlying intentions.  </p>

That was the proper approach.  Termination is a complex issue beyond the reasonable comprehension of a child of her age.  C had clear wishes and feelings. It is documented at &#167;16 that she doesn&#8217;t want to see him again. As C said this, she squashed a toy into a ball.  Ms Lacey wondered if that was a way to channel difficult feelings, and noted her change in tone and presentation as she spoke about her father.  </p>

She said that &#8220;some weight&#8221; should be placed on her expressed wishes and feelings as the child is now 8. Ms Ganser confirmed that from the conversations with mother, there is no reason to think the child&#8217;s wishes and feelings about future contact have changed.  I would add that the child is around the point that one ought to begin to take her views into account, without the issue being determined by them.  She is an intelligent child with no additional learning needs and some weight should be attached to her wishes and feelings.</p>

The prospect of having her father involved in her life is something that causes her distress.  She has not had contact with her father for several years.  Should that position change in future, that would cause her distress. It would produce, as Ms Ecob put it, &#8220;a traumatic response&#8221; in her.  It must be made clear that there is no psychological report.  The father submits that this should make the court hesitate before concluding that there would be harm.  However, it seems to me that the court is perfectly competent to assess the totality of the evidence.  It can reach a conclusion about whether there is a real risk of future harm.  In my judgment, it is absolutely clear that given the level and seriousness of the abuse of the child and her great reluctance to see him, that an obvious and safe inference is that having the father retain parental responsibility is likely to create emotional harm to the child he has sexually abused.  </p>

But at all times I had right at the front of my thoughts that this case was actually about you.  All the way through, what was best for you was the single most important thing I thought about in making all the many different decisions I had to.  These decisions are very important, and I knew when I was making them that they would shape your life.  I totally got that.

In the long time between me sitting down now to write this to you and your reading it, you might have wondered many times why I decided that your father should not be part of your life.  It was to protect you.  It was to make sure that you would be able to have a happy life and achieve everything you can achieve.  Everyone says you are a bright and intelligent girl.  I have seen a video of you and I can see why people say that.  You have just as much a right as anyone else in this country to grow up free from harm.  I wanted to make absolutely sure that from this point on that would happen by taking steps to keep your father out of your life.  I know you did not want to see him any longer.  I thought about it very carefully because it is a huge step.  But I decided that you were absolutely right.  And so was your mum.  Given what your father had done, it made no sense for him to have anything more to do with the important decisions in your life.  My decision was to make sure that this could not happen again.  I have a duty to protect children and this is what I have done.  </p>
