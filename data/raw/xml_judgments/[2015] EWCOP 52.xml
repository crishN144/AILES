	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In practice, apart from when it makes an interim appointment, the court rarely imposes a time limit on a deputy&#8217;s tenure. The average length of a property and affairs deputyship is three years and nine months. This is because the court&#8217;s clientele contains a preponderance of older people with age-related impairments of the mind or brain. To impose a time limit of, say, a year or even two years in these cases would not only be jobsworth but would also create a tsunami of customer complaints. When the MCA came into force in October 2007, the judges of the court made a conscious decision to apply section 16(4)(b) and to limit the duration of deputyship appointments to three years in all cases where P was a younger person who had been awarded damages for personal injury or clinical negligence. However, the bureaucratic constraints of having to make repeated applications and orders to renew the appointment from 2010 onwards were onerous, both for the deputies and the court, and even these appointments are now usually made without restriction and until further order. The requirement in Article 12.4 of the UNCRPD for &#8220;regular review by a competent, independent and impartial authority&#8221; is largely met by the Public Guardian&#8217;s functions in supervising deputies, receiving reports from them, and directing visits by a Court of Protection Visitor.</span></p>

This is mainly because, in cases involving older people, the effect of successiveness can be achieved more easily and effectively by means of a joint and several appointment of, say, P&#8217;s spouse and their children. Another reason why these applications are scarce is that neither the Court of Protection nor the Office of the Public Guardian has ever actively promoted successive appointments for reasons that will become obvious later in this judgment.</span></p>

This works at several levels. For anyone with autism, one would expect to see a reduced ability to communicate emotions via their facial expression, body language and vocal variation of such things as pitch and emphasis. This means that anyone who does not know someone with autism may easily misinterpret how they are feeling. As such, anyone who does not know a person with autism, who has to work with them, needs to check with people who know them well, how to interpret the person&#8217;s expression and behaviour.</span></p>

However, it can also be argued that a familiar person is less likely to seek the views of others and reach a consensus, Certainly, a person who has good experience of working with different people with autism should have the skills to meet a new person with autism and discuss them with the familiar carers to form a judgment as good as a single familiar person. However, this would take time and be less immediate than the assessment of a familiar person.&#8221;</span></p>

However, should the court consider than the appointment of a successor deputy is appropriate, the Public Guardian would suggest that it is clearly specified in the court order the circumstances in which the successor deputy is to take over, whether it would be necessary to return to the court to confirm the appointment and, if not, what documentation should be produced to others that evidences that the successor&#8217;s appointment is now valid. Furthermore the Public Guardian would also ask that it is specified in the order that the successor deputy is to notify him of their succession in order that he may fulfil his statutory duties to maintain the register and supervise deputies.</span></p>

Respondents agreed that this might be useful. &#8230; It may also be that the best candidate is already elderly and wishes to be sure that someone will take over at a time in the future. If there is a suitable person to take over then the court should be able to make such provision at the time when it is looking at the case. Some foreign jurisdictions also provide for a &#8216;standby&#8217; manager to be appointed, to take over on a temporary basis if the manager should die or become incapable of acting. This is only likely to be necessary in the rare case of a disabled person who should not be left for however short a period without a manager to exercise certain powers. Provision for a standby manager may, however, allay the fears of those respondents who pointed out that many elderly carers of young disabled persons experience great anxiety about what will become of the younger person once they, the carers, have &#8216;gone&#8217;.&#8221;</span></p>

Her parents were particularly worried that Social Services would muscle in.

I have a good example to illustrate this point. John Friel last appeared before me on 4 July 2013 in an identical application concerning AG, a young man with cerebral palsy, who was born in 1995. AG&#8217;s parents, who are high net worth individuals, proposed that, after both of them had died or become incapacitated, two financial advisers, who are family friends, would step in and act as his deputies for property and affairs, and an orthopaedic nurse practitioner, who is also a family friend, would become his deputy for personal welfare. After I had explained to Mr Friel and AG&#8217;s mother the impracticalities and imponderables associated with appointments of this kind, I asked Mr Friel to draft the order he required containing the successive appointment, but I heard nothing further from him. I asked him at the hearing on 14 July 2015 why never came back in AG&#8217;s case, and he said that he understood that AG&#8217;s parents no longer regarded one of the proposed successor deputies as suitable, and that they had decided not to proceed with the application, after all.</span></p>

There is no equivalent form, however, enabling a deputy to resign. What usually happens is that a deputy who wishes to resign or retire makes an application to the court for a new deputy to be appointed in his place. </span></p>
