Jayne&#8217;s trustees have a discretion regarding the application of any funds under her will trust. The local authority will monitor his use of the direct payments to which Angharad is entitled, and Edward&#8217;s management of the limited resources in Angharad&#8217;s free estate will be supervised by the Public Guardian in the usual way.</p>
