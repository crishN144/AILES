	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This application concerns a child, T.  He is now about 5 years old.  He is a British national; both his parents are British nationals.  He was born in Kyrenia in the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus (&#8216;TRNC&#8217;), and lived there from his birth in early 2014 until late summer 2018 when he travelled with his mother to the Republic of Cyprus, the southern territory of the island<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

		</authorialNote>, where he remained until 17 October 2018.  On that day, he flew to London, again in the company of his mother.  On each occasion on which T and his mother travelled, the mother was the subject of a formal deportation order from the relevant territory of the island of Cyprus.  On her arrival in this country the mother was arrested and taken into custody, where she has remained to date.  A police protection order was made in relation to T on his arrival in England, and he was placed into foster care, where he, in turn, has remained.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">That issue is whether the Family Court in this country can properly exercise jurisdiction in relation to T.  The Local Authority contends that it can and should do so; its stance is supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian on behalf of T, and by T&#8217;s father (Mr. V), who lives in England.  The mother opposes that outcome and argues that this court should decline jurisdiction; she argues that the courts of the Republic of Cyprus (notably in the southern territory, not the courts of the TRNC) should assume jurisdiction for T, and further argues that T should be physically sent back to the Republic of Cyprus forthwith.    </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Since 1974, Cyprus has been a divided island, separated by a UN buffer zone known as the &#8216;Green Line&#8217;, albeit with crossing points. In 1983 the northern part of Cyprus unilaterally declared independence and formed an unrecognised breakaway state, the TRNC.  While the Republic of Cyprus government is the legal authority for the whole island, the northern part of Cyprus (the TRNC) remains outside government control. The Republic of Cyprus has <span style="font-style:italic">de jure</span> sovereignty over the entire island, but the island is <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> partitioned into two main parts.   </p>

For that reason, the TRNC is seen as a safe haven for parents and families to take their children to evade UK social services, or other UK legal action. The Hague Convention is not applicable in the TRNC; the diplomatic mission and British High Commission in Nicosia have no legal authority there.

At the hearing at which the judgment was handed down, the mother indicated (through counsel) that she opposed publication of the judgment in that form, contending that the factual content, when read together with some limited material in the public domain, could lead to the identification of T as the subject of the proceedings.  All other parties supported publication in a largely unredacted format.  I adjourned the issue of whether the judgment should be published to hear full argument.  </p>

I concluded that T, whose welfare is a primary (though not the paramount) consideration in this regard, is entitled to enjoy the protections of his private life, and this outweighed the public interest in revealing detail about his and his mother&#8217;s life.  I accepted that I should not take any <span style="font-style:italic">unnecessary</span> risk of him being identified by the piecing together of an information &#8216;jigsaw&#8217;. I therefore significantly edited the next section containing the &#8216;background facts&#8217;.  The balance of the judgment remains (save for some minor editorial tweaks) as it was in the original version, unedited.  </p>

Her principal motivation in moving was to escape the involvement of social services (child protection) in her family life, with her (then unborn) baby.  The mother&#8217;s first child had, some years earlier, been removed permanently from her care following public law proceedings.  T&#8217;s father remained in England.  The mother went on to form a relationship with a Turkish national who is a fugitive from British justice.   </p>

This was apparently renewed on more than one occasion, but is unlikely on the evidence to have been renewed or extended beyond January 2015 at the latest.

T spent his first 4 years 8 months there; although the mother gave T an English name, she also used a Muslim name for him.  The mother says that T would call himself by his Muslim name, although I note from the filed evidence of the Local Authority that he vehemently opposes its use now.  According to the mother, T spoke &#8220;extremely good&#8221; Turkish.  It appears that T attended a nursery in the TRNC. He had a TRNC identity card. According to the mother T strongly bonded with his stepfather who is Turkish, and with his wider family with whom T apparently spent much time; T formed close relationships with his stepfather&#8217;s children.  It is apparent (from a summary of the social work records in my papers) that T was distressed to be separated from his stepfather (more so, as it happens, than his mother) when he was removed into care in the TRNC in late summer 2018, this corroborating (to a degree) the mother&#8217;s account of these family relationships.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The family law litigation concerning T has progressed at a slower than usual pace, not least because of the abuse of process challenge, and this jurisdiction argument.  The court has thus far proceeded on the basis that &#8220;[a]lthough the child is not habitually resident in the UK&#8221;, it is satisfied that it has power to deal with the case by exercising its interim protective powers under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 20 BIIR</span> (see above and below).   On 7 November 2018, the Local Authority&#8217;s application for a care order was listed before Her Honour Judge Hillier, the Designated Family Judge for West Yorkshire, for directions. The order generated on that day records the following: &#8220;Counsel instructed for the mother submitting that <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">the court does not have jurisdiction to make any order</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">under the </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref></span>&#8221; concerning T.  On the following day (8 November 2018), on a separate application by the Local Authority, the mother accepted the jurisdiction of the English court, <span style="font-style:italic">agreeing</span> &#8220;that it <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">would be appropriate for the court</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">to exercise jurisdiction</span>&#8221;, based upon British citizenship.  A week later (on 16 November 2018) at a court hearing concerning T, it was recorded that &#8220;counsel for the mother <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">no longer advances any argument that this court does not have jurisdiction</span> to make <span style="font-style:italic">section 31</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">section 38</span> orders&#8221; in respect of T.  Counsel then instructed later acknowledged that this concession had been made without instructions.  Just over one month later, on 18 December 2018, the mother&#8217;s position was confirmed on the order generated on that day which records: &#8220;Counsel on behalf of the mother has indicated that the mother <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">seeks to challenge the jurisdiction of the court</span> to make any orders under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref></span> in respect of [T]&#8221; (emphasis in each case by underlining added).

She relies in particular on the matters which I set out above at [16].  The mother maintains that as at 18 October 2018 T had not lost his habitual residence in the TRNC.  In support of that contention she maintains that his removal from the TRNC and/or from the Republic of Cyprus was in breach of his protected rights under <span style="font-style:italic">Directive 2004/38/EC</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic">European Parliament and the Council of the European Union</span> (esp. <span style="font-style:italic">Article 3, 27, 28</span>); as to this argument, (a) it is highly contentious whether the <span style="font-style:italic">2004/38/EC Directive</span> applies to the TRNC given the effect of Protocol 10, and (b) I am not in a position to determine the question of whether the removal was in breach of those specific rights.  It has not been fully argued, and the competent authority of the Republic of Cyprus is unaware (so far as I know) that the point has even been raised.  In any event,  I venture to suggest that had he not been allowed to accompany his mother (as his sole parent with parental responsibility) on her return to the UK, there would have been a powerful argument that his and her rights to respect for family life under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 8 ECHR</span> had been wrongly breached. The mother further maintains that T was &#8216;habitually resident&#8217; in a Member State at the material time, and that I should therefore decline jurisdiction under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 17</span> of <span style="font-style:italic">BIIR </span>(see [54]-[70] for my discussion of this issue below). </p>

Counsel provided a helpful summary of the factors which, they reasoned, pointed for and against such a conclusion; they drew attention to the <span style="font-style:italic">instability</span> of the mother&#8217;s circumstances as a fugitive and an overstayer, and observed, with considerable force, that criminal offending hardly facilitates the integration of a person with the social and family environment in a particular country.  Having seen the recently filed evidence of the mother (summarised at [15] and [16] above) Mr. Rowley QC and Ms Garnham in fact conceded at the hearing that T probably <span style="font-style:italic">had</span> acquired <span style="font-style:italic">sufficient degree</span> of integration as to justify a finding of habitual residence in the TRNC prior to August 2018, but that by the time the court here was seised, he had lost that habitual residence in the TRNC when his mother was deported, with him &#8216;in tow&#8217;. They argue that he had not gained habitual residence in the Republic of Cyprus or in England; he was therefore without an habitual residence.  They further argue that if T remained habitually resident in the TRNC when the court here was seised, he is not captured by <span style="font-style:italic">BIIR</span> which does not apply to the TRNC, and that the courts of England and Wales can assume jurisdiction under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 14 BIIR</span>. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The evidence is clear that the mother travelled to the TRNC in 2013 with a view to remaining there indefinitely, or at least, perhaps, until she no longer had dependent children.  The fact that she was a fugitive from social services living in the TRNC, in a relationship with a man who had himself fled criminal prosecution here, is in my judgment relevant to the stability and permanence of her habitual residence; as Burnett LJ described it (see [10] above), she was also forced to &#8220;sustain the relatively constrained life inevitable if [she] never leave[s] its territory&#8221;.  This is a factor which must have coloured the quality of her life to some extent, given the restrictions on her freedom of movement; it may well have (as Mr. Rowley submitted) given her an underlying sense of fear and insecurity in her renegade state, but did not in my judgment of itself prevent her from integrating to a degree into her new community.  The fact that she was an over-stayer in the country made her continued residence yet more precarious and unstable (see [39](vi) above), and indeed unlawful, but, again, it did not significantly or materially impede (as I found in <span style="font-style:italic">SS</span> at [41] above) her ability to integrate.    </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">By contrast, the mother&#8217;s integration into life in the TRNC was evidenced by her having formed a relationship with Mr. W, a Turkish national, soon after her arrival, bearing his child there and raising her there.  The mother worked in the TRNC as a cleaner (prior to her earning money through the proceeds of crime), she apparently made friends, and on her account assimilated into Mr. W&#8217;s wider Turkish family; her statement reveals how she was able to participate in, and how she enjoyed, the culture and the character of her new homeland.  An independent social work assessment of Mr. W (commissioned by the court here) verifies some of these points.  It is equally apparent on the written material that T integrated sufficiently too, largely as the mother herself has described in her statement (see [15] above).  It follows that I accept that the mother and T integrated into life in the TRNC sufficiently in the years since 2014 to justify a finding that T was habitually resident in the TRNC up to 31 August 2018.  For the reasons set out at [39](v) above, the see-saw was not firmly rooted to the ground in that country, but was susceptible to relatively easy disruption. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The mother&#8217;s move from the TRNC was sudden, and unplanned.  The move was effected under the strict supervision and control of the authorities of the TRNC.  The mother did not choose to leave the TRNC, and would indeed have preferred not to do so; neither she nor T had chance for any goodbyes.  I infer (though I am not sure that I have been specifically told) that the mother would wish to return.  Her partner (Mr. W) and youngest child (U) remain in the TRNC.  All of these factors may point to the maintenance of enduring ties to the TRNC which may be said to keep alive her &#8216;habitual residence&#8217; in that country.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On the other hand, the mother&#8217;s arrest and subsequent ejection from the TRNC ruptured her connections with that state profoundly and fundamentally, and in some respects potentially irreversibly. The relevant authorities of the TRNC have made it crystal clear that she cannot return to the TRNC at the present time, and indeed for the foreseeable future.  The only way in which she can achieve a return to the TRNC is if she makes a case to the Court in the TRNC and succeeds, &#8220;otherwise she will not be permitted to return&#8221; (see [22](ii) above).  In this way, in a very short space of time, she accomplished a significant, if not complete, &#8216;disengagement&#8217;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="7">

It is clear that regardless of his age (a point emphasised by repetition in the conversation with the relevant authorities), the same rules and considerations apply.  The only way for T to return to the TRNC is if someone makes a case to the Court in the TRNC and wins &#8220;otherwise he will not be permitted to return&#8221;. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It seems to me that a person cannot readily retain (or I would suggest retain at all) an habitual residence in a country which he or she has left under a deportation order (or as a dependent of a person under a deportation order), and to which he or she cannot lawfully return on the edict of that country&#8217;s competent authority.  In those circumstances, he or she cannot practically continue, or resume, any of the features of his or her life which represent the life he or she has previously enjoyed; integration &#8211; even to a limited degree &#8211; is lost both abruptly and decisively.  Of the illustrations offered by the authorities, the situation of the deported person is perhaps most analogous to that of the child refugee who loses their habitual residence without gaining another (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re J </span>at [42] above), or the person &#8216;emigrating&#8217;, referred to by Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">Re LC</span> (see [40] above); it is notable that the &#233;migr&#233; quickly (even &#8220;immediately&#8221;) loses his or her habitual residence.  These points are consistent with the fact that <span style="font-style:italic">BIIR</span> is designed to facilitate a readily accessible basis of jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility falling primarily (i.e. &#8220;in the first place&#8221;) in the Member State of the child&#8217;s habitual residence; <span style="font-style:italic">BIIR</span> could not, or could not easily, be applied effectively across Member States if jurisdiction could be said to lie in a country from which the child, and his parent, are barred from entry, by the authorities of that country. </p>

Significantly, the mother was deported from the Republic of Cyprus too on the basis that her &#8220;conduct represents a genuine present and sufficiently serious threat&#8221; (see [23] above).

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Put shortly, counsel for the mother contend that Protocol 10 does not impinge on the question of this court&#8217;s jurisdiction in relation to property located (or, by analogy, people habitually resident in) the TRNC.  They rely on the fact that the CJEU found that the suspension of the application of the <span style="font-style:italic">acquis communautaire</span> in those areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the government of that member state does not exercise effective control, does not preclude the application of <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels 1</span> to a judgment which is given by a Cypriot court sitting in the area of the island effectively controlled by the Cypriot government, even though that judgment concerns land situated in areas not so controlled.  They contend that <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels 1</span> treats the TRNC as part of the Member State of the Republic of Cyprus, and so should <span style="font-style:italic">BIIR</span>.   They further contend that given the many direct similarities between the language and the purpose of the two regulations, <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels 1</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">BIIR</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Orams</span> provides good authority for the argument that T, habitually resident in the TRNC (outside the Government&#8217;s effective control) was nonetheless, at the critical point, subject to the provisions of <span style="font-style:italic">BIIR</span>.  They rely on <span style="font-style:italic">Orams</span> for the further proposition that the Protocol (giving effect to the <span style="font-style:italic">suspension</span> of laws) should be interpreted restrictively (&#8220;limited to what is absolutely necessary in order to obtain its objective&#8221;: see para 35 CJEU judgment). </p>

Specifically, the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Orams</span> was not concerned with the establishing of primary jurisdiction (as here) but was concerned with the <span style="font-style:italic">recognition and enforcement</span> of a judgment issued out of a court of a Member State &#8211; the Republic of Cyprus (i.e. <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> the court of the TRNC, which the Adv Gen in <span style="font-style:italic">Orams</span> made clear would not be a court of a Member State).  She emphasised that by reason of the island's division, the judgement reached by the Cypriot court was not directly enforceable in the TRNC, hence Mr. Apostolides used <span style="font-style:italic">Brussels 1</span> to have the Cypriot judgment registered and applied against the Orams' assets in the UK, and this is not a remedy which can translate to the facts here.

The Republic of Cyprus is also a party to BIIa by virtue of its accession to the European Union in 2004. In this context I pause to note however, that whilst the Republic of Cyprus acceded to the European Union in 2004, this did not act to apply the provisions of BIIa to Northern Cyprus. As noted above, although, <span style="font-style:italic">de jure</span>, the Republic of Cyprus represents Cyprus as a whole, <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> it controls only the southern area of the island. Within this context, the application of the <span style="font-style:italic">acquis communautaire</span> (the accumulated legislation, legal acts, and court decisions which constitute the body of European Union law) to the areas of the island over which the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise sovereign jurisdiction was suspended by a separate Protocol to the Treaty of Accession (see Art 1.1 of Protocol No 10 on Cyprus annexed to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of Accession of 2003).&#8221; </p>

It is the position of all parties (other than the mother) that the mother&#8217;s case would be likely to import the following consequences. First, this court would be prevented from taking any further steps to consider or promote T&#8217;s wellbeing.  Secondly, <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> a state authority were to take legal proceedings in relation to T in the court of the Republic of Cyprus (i.e. it is accepted that the English Court would cede jurisdiction to the courts of the Republic of Cyprus <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> the TRNC), it is highly questionable that the court there would consider that it could exercise jurisdiction.  Thirdly, if it did feel able to exercise jurisdiction, the court seised with deciding T&#8217;s future would be one in a country/territory with which he has only the slimmest of connections<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="15">

		</authorialNote>.  Fourthly, the mother&#8217;s re-entry to the Republic of Cyprus is forbidden within three years of the date of her deportation; thus she would not be able to position herself to care for T there, nor would there be any prospect of direct contact between T and her there, as there is here.  Fifthly, there is no person in the Republic of Cyprus with a connection to T, to offer him care; he would in all probability lose contact with his father (in England).  Finally, during any legal process, the mother </p>
