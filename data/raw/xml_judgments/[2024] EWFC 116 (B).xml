The further hearing was listed before me on 13&#160;October and H failed to attend that hearing.  He did send an email to the court the day before saying that he lives in the USA and as such the notice he had been given to attend in person along with the cost of&#160;a&#160;short notice flight, makes it physically not possible at this time, but he did plan to attend the UK towards the end of the year although nothing had been booked and he would be happy to join the hearing remotely.  </p>

In his decision and the order he recorded that his findings were that there were insufficient funds to make provision to meet the applicant's needs which he put at &#163;6,000&#160;per month.  He made an order of periodical payments for &#163;3,500&#160;per month and it is&#160;a&#160;joint lives order or until H&#8217;s retirement at aged 67, together with CPI adjustment payments to be made on the 28th day of the month.  </p>

At that time the arrears were &#163;35,282.64&#160;and the payment, taking into account the CPI adjustment, had increased to &#163;3,851.93&#160;from 28&#160;April 2022.

That hearing took place before HHJ Evans-Gordon and he attended remotely.  Her order reflects that he agreed to reinstate maintenance from 28&#160;June 2023&#160;until the conclusion of the proceedings.  I understand that he informed the court that the reasons why payments had not been made was because of&#160;a&#160;judgment debt, but that that had now been resolved and he was able to make payments going forward.  He also gave an assurance that &#163;43,000&#160;remained in the NatWest account for the company and that that money would not be utilised pending further hearing.  </p>

That document is quite interesting.  It is not in&#160;a&#160;Form A.  He made it on&#160;a&#160;D11&#160;and he set out the reasons why he was applying for the variation and there were two reasons given.  Firstly was that the order had been made on the basis that W would be earning &#163;20,000&#160;per annum and he thought that by now she ought to have been doing that, and secondly, that she is cohabiting.  There is no reference in that D11&#160;to the application being made because he cannot afford it. </p>

That order had&#160;a&#160;penal notice attached to it and, as far as I am aware, it has not been complied with.  As I said, I am satisfied that that order was served on 31&#160;October 2023.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">There is no doubt that the order that the court is being asked to make is&#160;a&#160;draconian one and this was enforced by Peter Jackson LJ who confirmed in <span style="font-style:italic">de Gafforj v de Gafforj </span> the description of such an order made by Sir Ernest Ryder in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Assoun v Assoun</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2017/21" uk:canonical="[2017] EWCA Civ 21" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWCA Civ 21</ref>, namely:</p>

The order has to be proportionate to the problem and go no further than necessary to remedy it.  His decision also refers to the decision of Bodie J in <span style="font-style:italic">Mubarak v Mubarik</span> [2006] EWHC 1260&#160;(Fam) in which he said that non-payment in breach of&#160;a&#160;maintenance order is in itself&#160;a&#160;contempt of court regardless of ability to pay and that questions of ability to pay come into play when the court decides whether and how to act on the contempt.  Also, as to the third condition, namely whether there is an impediment to the course of justice, this is likely to include what was described by Sir Mark Potter in <span style="font-style:italic">Laing v Laing</span> [2005] EWHC (Fam) that it was "making it more difficult for the court to ascertain the truth or to enforce the orders that it makes."</p>

There are numerous examples in the history of these proceedings where he has failed to comply with court orders, not only the original ones, the payment of maintenance, but also the orders within these proceedings for disclosure and to attend for questioning.  These failures to comply have put the applicant at significant cost because there have had to be more hearings than would otherwise have been necessary.

He was given clear notice that he was required to attend in person.  He was given sufficient time to make the necessary arrangements.  He was served with the order giving the notice of hearing on 31&#160;October.  He was also given&#160;a&#160;means by which to apply to vary that direction if he wished to do so, but he failed to avail himself of that.  That is in addition to his ongoing contempt in relation to failing to comply with the original order as to maintenance, despite having made sporadic payments.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">Is there then an impediment to the course of justice?  Ms&#160;de Navarro says that there is.  She refers me to the applicant's statement in support of this application, which is in fact attached to the application itself.  She has exhausted her savings, not only paying for her income needs but also paying for legal costs and she is now having to rely on credit cards and borrowing.  I am told that she is, and I can understand why, extremely stressed by these proceedings.  Clearly there will be an impediment to justice in the event that she is unable to pursue matters with the assistance of legal representation, given the fact that the respondent, H, is in the United States of America, and his failure to comply with orders to date.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">The decision in <span style="font-style:italic">de Gafforj v de Gafforj</span> related to two breaches. One was in relation to&#160;a&#160;legal services payments order, and one was in relation to non-payment of maintenance.  Jackson LJ slightly differentiates between the two at paragraph 17&#160;of his judgment when he says:</p>

Yes, but only to&#160;a&#160;marginal extent.  I would differentiate between the unpaid costs and maintenance on the one hand and the unpaid legal services payments on the other.  The latter impacts in the most direct way possible upon the course of justice; the position of the former is less clear.  I am far from dismissing the wife's concerns about the effect upon her everyday life of the abrupt and arbitrary removal of her income stream, and the knock-on effect on her ability to participate in the proceedings, and I would not want to be understood as saying that there are no circumstances in which such&#160;a&#160;contempt could found an order of this kind; but in this case it does not compare to the strikingly direct impediment to the course of justice represented by the contempt in relation to the litigation services payment order &#8230;"</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">Ms&#160;de Navarro says that this case is differentiated from <span style="font-style:italic">de Gafforj</span> because in this case there is no legal services payments order.  A pragmatic decision was taken not to pursue such an application because of the history and the costs and so, in effect, the maintenance is being used to fund the cost of legal proceedings which otherwise might have been the subject of&#160;a&#160;LSPO order, namely there is one pot of money and this wife is having to use it to fund living expenses and legal costs and therefore there clearly is an impediment to justice by H's failure to make the payments.  I accept and I agree with her argument in that respect and I am satisfied that breach of this order, coupled with breaches of all the other directions orders that have been made, are such that there will be an impediment to justice if the order is not enforced and the order that is being sought made.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">But I must also consider the effect of the impediment to justice on H if he is unable to gain access to the court in circumstances where he is applying to vary the order that is being sought to be enforced. In circumstances where somebody is told that they cannot pursue an application to vary because they cannot afford to pay the order unless they pay the arrears under the order, then it puts them in&#160;a&#160;difficult position.  However, I am satisfied  that is not the case here and I make specific reference to the D11 on which H  has made his application to vary.  He has not made this application on the basis that he says he cannot afford to pay it.  He made the application on the basis that W would have &#163;20,000&#160;per annum which should be offset against maintenance and also that she is cohabiting.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">So far as the former is concerned, he is correct in his broad analysis, but on looking at the judgment of HHJ O'Dwyer, that is not what was said.  In the judgment HHJ O'Dwyer made&#160;a&#160;finding that W&#8217;s needs were &#163;6,000&#160;per month and that they could not be met by H in full as there were insufficient funds at that time to meet such an order. He made the order he did knowing that there would be&#160;a&#160;shortfall.  He then went on to say at paragraph 83&#160;of his judgment that he was satisfied that within the next 12&#160;months H  would have an income of &#163;100,000&#160;per annum and that W would have an income of around &#163;20,000&#160;per annum and so what he said was that there was no reduction in his order in 2018&#160;when he considered that W could be in work because by that time he considered that H  would have increased his income and that they each cancelled each other out. The income that W was going to receive filled the shortfall in what he assessed was the difference between her reasonable needs and what H could afford to pay. H&#8217;s argument in that respect is wrong.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">The court does not know about the position in relation to the allegation of cohabitation, but the application is not based on inability to pay and it is not for&#160;a&#160;party to take it upon himself to stop making payments of an order pending&#160;a&#160;determination by the court as to whether or not they should do so and whether the order should be suspended pending the application to vary. In this respect I am aware of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Tattersall v Tattersall </span> which makes it clear that applications to vary do not prevent enforcement but in any event H has not attended this hearing or put forward any argument that enforcement should be postponed pending the outcome of his application for variation.  I am satisfied that this is not&#160;a&#160;case where there should be&#160;a&#160;stay pending enforcement, because of the reasons given as to why the application is made.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">Finally then is there any other realistic and effective remedy?  The answer to that appears to be no.  H is residing in the United States of America.  He has very few, if any, assets here.  I am satisfied that he deliberately misled the court as to the position in relation to the &#163;43,000&#160;which he gave assurances in June 2023&#160;was in the company's NatWest account as the bank accounts and statements for that account disclosed with his E1 clearly show that on the date in question he had approximately &#163;5,000&#160;in the account.  So, I am satisfied that there is no other realistic and effective remedy, that the order is proportionate to the problem and goes no further than necessary to remedy it. I make&#160;a&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">Hadkinson</span> order preventing H from pursuing his application to vary unless and until he makes&#160;a&#160;payment to W of &#163;61,901.62&#160;in relation to the arrears and the sum of &#163;13,687.20&#160;in relation to the costs that are outstanding as at today's date.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">Ordinarily, claims for costs are dealt with under the provisions of FPR 28&#160;and that of course provides for the starting point to be no order for costs but for the court to be able to make&#160;a&#160;different order in the event that there has been, in effect, litigation conduct.  That provision refers to and relates to financial remedies applications.  A D50K is not included within the definition of the financial remedy applications and so the no order as to costs starting point does not apply.  The rules to be applied are the Civil Procedure Rules, and in particular CPR 44.2&#160;with the exception of 44.2(2), which is the rule that, if&#160;a&#160;court decides to make an order about costs, the general rule is that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party, but the court may make&#160;a&#160;different order.  That presumption does not apply, but nevertheless the courts have made it clear in decisions, including that of Butler-Sloss LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Gojkovic v Gojkovic (No.2)[1991]2 FLR</span> that you have to start somewhere and in her view this remained the correct starting point although it may be displaced more easily in family law cases.  Obviously when applying what is known as the clean sheet, the court has to look at all the circumstances of the case.  </p>
