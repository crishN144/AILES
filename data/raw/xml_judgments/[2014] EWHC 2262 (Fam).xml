The parents were not formally notified of the hearing listed on 6 June until the very late evening of 5 June. Further, Dr Z was not notified of the direction that he prepare an addendum report on the current state of M&#8217;s mental health until the late afternoon of 4 June.

The mother was not present nor represented. Ms Clift of the Official Solicitor&#8217;s Office however was present in court, because the mother had been assessed as lacking capacity to litigate, although the Official Solicitor had not yet been formally appointed to act as her litigation friend.</p>

She did so. It appears a very junior and inexperienced member of the legal department was entrusted with preparing the case for the hearing on 6 June. She was unsupervised by a more senior colleague because of holiday commitments. I was assured such events would not occur again and that provision would be made for the supervision of junior members of staff when more senior members were away on vacation. </p>

She suffers from persecuting delusions including a belief that mental health services are &#8216;murderers&#8217; and will murder her and her unborn child.

On the exceptional facts of this case I was wholly satisfied that the balance fell decisively in favour of making the RRO. It was the only proportionate course to be taken to secure the safety of the mother and of the child. The restriction on the press would be of short duration &#8211; a matter of days rather than months or years. </p>

It was suggested the local authority would need two weeks to undertake the assessment. I made it plain that such a delay was wholly unacceptable. </p>

This is evidenced for example by her extreme reluctance to talk with me in the presence of the Children&#8217;s Services Social Worker. It is noted however that once she did agree to talk she relaxed and was able to have a conversation. M remains of the opinion that she is not mentally ill and that she does not require medication for mental illness. (I note that she is in fact taking this medication each day as prescribed). She continues to have quite marked thought disorder. This is evidenced by great difficulty that she has in being able to succinctly and appropriately deal with, discuss, evaluate and consider ideas. Her statements tend to be long and rambling with multiple repetitions of phrases and themes throughout. </p>

Unfortunately the mother&#8217;s contact sessions have not gone well. Despite advice and support she was unable to understand her baby&#8217;s needs or to meet them even in the environment of closely supervised contact. She was, for example, unable to support the baby&#8217;s head or to understand why she needed to do so. The local authority proposes to keep the issue of the frequency of the mother&#8217;s contact and of the father&#8217;s contact and the circumstances in which it takes place under close review. </p>
