The children were placed in the care of the LA in November 2011 when the parents were arrested and charged with offences of assault and child cruelty. The parents subsequently challenged the jurisdiction of the court to make orders, as they submitted the habitual residence of the children was in France. That issue was raised six months into the proceedings and, despite the inevitable delay, needed to be determined. That issue was determined after the children had been with foster carers for a year. It is essential the court is alive to issues of jurisdiction, enquiring of this issue in cases where it may be relevant at an early stage in the proceedings and making effective directions for it to be determined without delay. That did not happen in this case.</span></p>

They have provided the father with extremely effective representation. The court is particularly grateful when it is very aware of the huge pressures on legal representatives who undertake publicly funded family work. Their response to the request demonstrates the enormous commitment and dedication of those who undertake this work, which is often not properly recognised. If they had not so efficiently responded to the request there was a real risk there would have been further delay for these young children, who have already waited over 18 months for a decision about their future.</span></p>

The statement records DN stating that her identity information was forged in order for her to gain entry to the UK, she was given a different date of birth by the father as she did not speak English and this would help her gain additional education. DN says she was told to call the parents &#8216;dad&#8217; and &#8216;mum&#8217;.  Following this information the LA has instructed a private investigator to make enquiries in Cameroon regarding DN.

For example, the positive step that the mother had taken to make arrangements to seek support for her and the children in France, yet despite doing that she still returned the children (DN and GN) to be cared for by the father. Ms Green&#8217;s evidence was given before the further acknowledgement by the mother, during her oral evidence in this hearing, of events in the family home (e.g. the assault of her and DN by the father).  She accepted the mother had made some acknowledgement of the harm that had been caused to the children (for example, by wanting to say sorry to DN), which she regarded as positive, but she described it as a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;very late shift&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> by the mother.

She responded that until very recently the mother had consistently denied there was any harm or domestic abuse in the home, other than her acknowledgment of the conviction. She was awaiting the outcome of the assessment being undertaken by Dr Blumenthal and was aware that the mother was travelling to and from France, where she had support. In relation to contact, she was kept updated on events at contact through the detailed contact recordings.

Whilst I have factored in the undoubted pressure in giving oral evidence, and the difficulties inherent in assessing the position through an interpreter, this lack of empathy for the children was, in my judgment, a feature in much of her oral evidence. For example, her failure to ask DN whether she had been assaulted by the father after the mother left in 2010; her description of DN not crying after she had been slapped by her father and her statement that it would not have hurt her; her failure to grasp in her oral evidence what the risk was to the children after she left, bearing in mind what she had described about the father losing his temper if the children made a noise; her failure to ask GN any more detail about what she said the father had done when he &#8216;tapped&#8217; her and what had caused him to do that; her failure to enquire more when  she had observed DN crying. Without this ability to empathise the children would, in my judgment, be at risk of significant harm if returned to her care as the mother simply does not have the internal cues to take steps to protect the children. This is something not related to the mother&#8217;s relationship with the father or with another violent partner.</span></p>

The court should strive, where the children&#8217;s welfare demands, to re-unite children with their birth family, but that can&#8217;t be at the expense of putting them at an unacceptable risk of future harm which cannot be managed to an acceptable level to protect the children. In this case, if they returned to their mother&#8217;s care they would all be put at such risk and so, acknowledging that this is against the wishes of GN and GRN, the balance comes down firmly against them returning to live with her.</span></p>

Both GN and GRN are extremely well settled with their current carers and CMN is likely to join them in the summer. The continuity and stability of placement for GN and GRN and placement of the siblings together are important welfare considerations for these children.

For the reasons outlined above the children cannot return to the care of their mother and cannot be placed with the wider family. GN and GRN are placed in a secure and stable placement where they have made good progress and are well settled. They have said they wish to remain living there if they can&#8217;t return to the care of their mother. The plan is for them to be joined there by CMN, so the siblings will be placed together long term. It is proposed they should have direct contact with their mother four times a year and have continuing direct contact with DN. The position regarding the father&#8217;s contact is going to be assessed and managed by the LA. All the professional evidence recommends the children being placed with the current carers long term and they are committed to providing long term care for the children. Both the LA and Children&#8217;s Guardian agree adoption is the best outcome for these children, I accept their evidence and rationale for that view. There is, in my judgment, no advantage to the children in delaying a final decision; I am clearly of the view any further delay is likely to be prejudicial to their welfare. They have been waiting over 18 months for a decision about their future care, in those circumstances there should only be consideration of any further delay in circumstances where there are powerful welfare reasons for doing so. There is not in this case. The suggestion that the proposed carers may wish to apply for special guardianship rather than adoption is not such a reason, making a placement order does not prevent that. I am satisfied that the lifelong welfare needs of these children require a placement order to be made and in those circumstances the parent&#8217;s consent is dispensed with pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/52/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 52 (1)</ref> b) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>. </span></p>
