He is the youngest of five children. His siblings were all subsequently adopted.  C has two adult half-siblings who are the children of his mother.  He was placed in the care of his mother under the auspices of the care order.  He was removed from his mother&#8217;s care and placed in foster care in August 2007.  C was noted to exhibit overly sexualised behaviour towards other children and engaged in behaviours which placed himself and others at risk of harm.  Suffice it to say for the purposes of this judgment that it is agreed he has had a troubled childhood.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In July 2009 C was placed in a long-term foster placement which subsisted until August 2014.  The increasingly difficult behaviours exhibited by C led him to move to another foster placement which then unfortunately also broke down.  In or about April 2015 C moved to live in what I will describe as &#8220;N House&#8221;, a residential unit where he remains to date.  This unit was identified because the local authority concluded that C required a specialist residential unit with high levels of supervision and where staff were specifically trained to manage high levels of aggression and intimidation and to work with C to manage his sexualised behaviours. </p>

An issue upon which the local authority and the Official Solicitor placed considerable emphasis are the examples of C either (a) testing the boundaries of the close supervision at the residential unit, (b) resisting or refusing to comply with the restrictions placed upon him, and/or (c) breaching on occasions what may be termed the house rules. </p>

		    <p class="ColorfulGrid-Accent11" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities<span style="font-size:13pt">]</span> include the right to physical liberty, which is guaranteed by article 5 of the European Convention. This is not a right to do or to go where one pleases. It is a more focussed right, not to be deprived of that physical liberty. But, as it seems to me, what it means to be deprived of liberty must be the same for everyone, whether or not they have physical or mental disabilities. If it would be a deprivation of my liberty to be obliged to live in a particular place, subject to constant monitoring and control, only allowed out with close supervision, and unable to move away without permission even if such an opportunity became available, then it must also be a deprivation of the liberty of a disabled person. The fact that my living arrangements are comfortable, and indeed make my life as enjoyable as it could possibly be, should make no difference. A gilded cage is still a cage&#8230;.. So is there an acid test for the deprivation of liberty in these cases?.... The answer, as it seems to me, lies in those features which have consistently been regarded as "key" in the jurisprudence which started with <span style="font-style:italic">HL v United Kingdom </span><a class="Hyperlink" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/eu/cases/ECHR/2002/850.html" title="Link to BAILII version">40 EHRR 761</a>: that the person concerned "was under continuous supervision and control and was not free to leave" (para 91). I would not go so far as Mr Gordon, who argues that the supervision and control is relevant only insofar as it demonstrates that the person is not free to leave. A person might be under constant supervision and control but still be free to leave should he express the desire so to do. Conversely, it is possible to imagine situations in which a person is not free to leave but is not under such continuous supervision and control as to lead to the conclusion that he was deprived of his liberty. Indeed, that could be the explanation for the doubts expressed in <span style="font-style:italic">Haidn v Germany</span>.&#8221;</p>

At the outset of an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.100</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, the court may well have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the young person is likely to suffer significant harm if the court does not exercise its inherent jurisdiction to authorise a deprivation of liberty. If the court did not do so there is a risk that the protective measures needed to ensure the safety and well-being of the young person could not be put in place or enforced.

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;I am satisfied that the result which the local authority wishes to achieve cannot be achieved by the making of any other kind of order. Further, I am satisfied that, if the court's jurisdiction is not exercised, AB is likely to suffer significant harm. Absent a deprivation of liberty authorisation, AB's continued placement at X would be unlawful and in breach of Article 5.

Accordingly, AB would have to move to another establishment, where he would not be under constant supervision and control.

		    <p class="ColorfulGrid-Accent11" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It would, therefore, appear that, if the inference which Mrs. Gillick's advisers seek to draw from the provisions is justified, a minor under the age of 16 has no capacity to authorise any kind of medical advice or treatment or examination of his own body. That seems to me so surprising that I cannot accept it in the absence of clear provisions to that effect. It seems to me verging on the absurd to suggest that a girl or a boy aged 15 could not effectively consent, for example, to have a medical examination of some trivial injury to his body or even to have a broken arm set&#8230;. It is, in my view, contrary to the ordinary experience of mankind, at least in Western Europe in the present century, to say that a child or a young person remains in fact under the complete control of his parents until he attains the definite age of majority, now 18 in the United Kingdom, and that on attaining that age he suddenly acquires independence. In practice most wise parents relax their control gradually as the child develops and encourage him or her to become increasingly independent. Moreover, the degree of parental control actually exercised over a particular child does in practice vary considerably according to his understanding and intelligence and it would, in my opinion, be unrealistic for the courts not to recognise these facts. Social customs change, and the law ought to, and does in fact, have regard to such changes when they are of major importance&#8221;.</p>

It will be a question of fact whether a child seeking advice has sufficient understanding of what is involved to give a consent valid in law. Until the child achieves the capacity to consent, the parental right to make the decision continues save only in exceptional circumstances.&#8221;</p>

If I was satisfied that C&#8217;s consent was a ruse and he would withdraw the same the moment the court case was concluded, it is likely I would not have concluded that he had not given a valid and genuine consent to his confinement. Once, however, I am satisfied that he had given a valid consent, the fact that he may withdraw that consent, at some point in the near future, does not in any way negate the valid consent he gave nor does it negate the legal consequences of that consent. </p>

Against that risk must be balanced the potential benefits to C of the court having found him to be <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick </span>competent, to have found he understood the issues resulting in his placement at the unit and the reasons for his confinement there and having accepted his word that he agreed to stay there and to abide by the restrictions. In my judgment those benefits include C feeling empowered to take control of his life, to continue to engage with the staff in a meaningful way and to improve his prospects of a leading a fulfilling and rewarding future life. These are powerful factors in support of my taking the risk I have identified. </p>
