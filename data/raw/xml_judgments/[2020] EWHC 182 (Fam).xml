I have changed the name of the place to preserve the children&#8217;s anonymity. The application is to set aside a witness summons to A and B issued by HHJ Singleton QC on 29 November 2019. The application raises an important issue about the circumstances in which disclosure can be resisted on grounds of a religious duty of confidentiality, in the context of allegations of child sexual abuse. As I explain below, the facts of this case raise very great concern about the safeguarding of children within the Jehovah&#8217;s Witness community. I am therefore intending to publish this judgment, but will anonymise it in a way that will protect the children&#8217;s identities.  </p>

The Elders spoke to me, came into my house and had a meeting with me to clarify what had happened and what [E] had said. They spoke to the father to confirm the report to him and advised that he would be removed from the congregation. The Elders informed me that I had to think about the consequences of my actions as mentioned, I wanted to go to the police but the message I felt I was receiving was that police involvement was not the appropriate thing to do. I fully accept that this was not was being said to me but this is what I was feeling. I did fear that my children would be taken away from me but I didn&#8217;t keep it to myself, I did talk to the Elders. The Elders took disciplinary action with the father and advised me to change my work hours to ensure that I was home for the children when the father was home. I dropped my hours but I was still going out of the house leaving the father at home with the children. I believed that I had put in place protective measures. The father had been disciplined and he promised me that he would not do anything again. Our marriage did effectively come to an end at that stage and he remained only as a provider for the family.  </span></p>

They did not report those allegations to the police until July 2019. This was despite knowing that the alleged abuser, the Father, remained living in the same household as E. It is not possible from these documents to work out the precise timing of events, but it seems from document (c) that the elders knew the abuse was occurring over a prolonged period and knew that it was alleged by E that it was continuing. It also seems from the limited information before the Court that the elders believed the allegations, or certainly did not disbelieve them. I can only say that on the documents that I have seen that the approach of the Congregation to E&#8217;s allegations, and their failure to take effective steps to protect a young child within their community, on the face of it gives rise to deep concern. </p>

Firstly, Mr Achonu told me that the 2013 policy had been replaced in 2017, but the 2017 document was not produced before me. Secondly, the 2013 policy appears to be significantly stronger than the 2018 policy. The 2013 policy at para 7 refers to conversations relating to spiritual counselling being reported to third parties if the child may be at a risk of harm. However, in the 2018 document there is no reference to this, and the onus seems to be being placed very firmly on parents, with little or no responsibility being taken by the Congregation.  It is a matter of real concern that the Congregation appears to be weakening its policy about safeguarding children. Thirdly, there is no reference in either of the documents for the need for consent to disclose otherwise confidential discussions before disclosure is made. Mr Achonu could not tell me where the alleged requirement by the elders that consent was required before disclosure given, had come from.  </p>

I note that what has happened in this case does not appear to be an aberration just by the two ministers, A and B, because it is clear from the documentation that has been produced that E&#8217;s allegations were raised and considered at a higher level within the Congregation. I cannot tell whether what has happened in this case is indicative of a more widespread problem within the Congregation, and that is a matter for the IICSA and not me.

He says that that duty of confidentiality is protected by article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). In the light of this argument he says that A and B are prepared to disclose information given to them by the Mother, because she has provided her consent, but not by the Father because he has not given consent. It is not at all clear how in practice this would work, given that much of the information sought relates to both of them.

Such discussions are not subject to privilege in the sense that something a defendant or appellant tells his lawyers would be; and the internal rules of Camden social services (or of any other local authority&#8217;s officers) are not binding in the courts; but we regard them as well drafted, sensible and worthy of respect. There is a distinction between disclosure necessary to avoid imminent future criminality (in particular a threat to someone&#8217;s life or safety) and the obtaining of admissions to past offences. It would be extremely unfortunate if convicted defendants (whether young or adult) were deterred from speaking to those charged with their supervision or rehabilitation until any appeal against conviction had been dealt with. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Firstly, there is no evidence that the material sought through the witness summons was in any sense a confession or akin to a confession. It appears that the allegation of sexual abuse came to the elders&#8217; attention because the Mother reported it, not because the Father confessed to the elders, or sought spiritual counselling. The elders then carried out some form of investigation and met with the Father, probably on more than one occasion. It is possible that at some point the Father &#8220;confessed&#8221;, but I have no evidence this was the case. In any event, the investigation cannot itself amount to a confession. Therefore, to the degree that there is a duty of confidentiality in relation to a confession, which I am prepared to assume on the basis of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R v Hay</span>, but not decide, it would not arise here. </p>

The elders appear to have been neither carrying out an investigation into the child&#8217;s allegations and how she could be protected, nor providing spiritual counselling to the Father. Mr Achonu&#8217;s submission in my view provides a plain example of his clients, with or without the agreement of the Congregation more widely, putting the Father&#8217;s interests above those of the child. </p>

The information held by the Congregation has the potential to be highly relevant both for the future protection and wellbeing of E and F, but also of other children. The information is likely relevant to three key questions for the Court &#8211; whether the threshold findings of fact in respect of the Father are made out; whether the Mother failed to protect E; and what future risk the Father poses to E if she lives with her Mother. It is also potentially highly relevant to whether the Father poses a risk to other children.  This is a situation which is concerned with future child protection, and not simply past criminality, it therefore falls on the other side of the line applying the approach in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R v H</span> at [53].  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Fourthly, Mr Achonu accepted that whether the duty of religious confidentiality is examined through the common law or article 9 it is not an absolute duty. This is clear from the caselaw, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R v H</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R v Hay</span> and the words of article 9(2). Respect for A and B&#8217;s religious beliefs is given by article 9(1), but that is qualified by article 9(2) including in the interests of public safety, the protection of health and morals, and the protection of the rights and freedom of others. It could not be more obvious that a freedom to manifest ones religious beliefs must give way to the need to protect a child from sexual abuse. That balance is to some degree reflected in the two policy documents, but has not been reflected in A and B&#8217;s approach to this case. The evidence points inexorably to A and B having protected their and the Father&#8217;s religious beliefs at the expense of the protection of the child. </p>

The interference in their religious rights is in my view relatively slight, given the terms of the two policy documents and the fact that the information does not appear to have been given in a confession or in any real sense as spiritual counselling. The other side of the proportionality balance is that the need for the protection of E and F, as well as other children is a highly weighty if not overriding factor.  </p>
