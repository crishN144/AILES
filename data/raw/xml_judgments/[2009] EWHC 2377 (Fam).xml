The judgment is reported as <span style="font-weight:bold">S v S (ancillary relief after lengthy separation)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/2339" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 2339 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 2339 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 2120" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 2120</ref>. Subject to any appeal by W (and there was none), and implementation by the former husband (H) of the terms imposed upon him to achieve a clean break, that might and ideally should have been the resolution for them both of the long drawn-out and emotionally draining process from their separation in March 1996 via decree absolute in September 2003 to the end of ancillary relief proceedings which W commenced in November 2003. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I now give judgment in relation to the subsequent application made by W on 14th May 2008 whereby she seeks to set aside the September 2006 order. I read and heard submissions and evidence between 27th and 30th April and on 6th May 2009. I then reserved judgment to await the outcome of an anticipated appeal to the Court Appeal which, it was thought, might offer further guidance in relation to some of the legal issues in the case. That appeal was, however, compromised without hearing. Meanwhile, however, I was referred by counsel for H (Miss Stone QC and Miss Phipps) to two recent Court of Appeal decisions which were arguably germane. In mid-August I received from counsel for H (Mr Singleton QC and Mr Nagpal) their further submissions in relation to those two cases. </p>

The principal areas of the case upon which enquiry has focused are the evidence at the hearing of the value of the company T Ltd ('the company') run by H, and its subsequent sale for very significantly more than the range postulated in the divergent evidence before me. Also subjected to scrutiny has been the refinancing package negotiated for the company prior to its sale; and its consequent ability to pay substantial arrears of preference share dividends owing to H, and to buy out the interest of a venture capital investor (ICG), plus the facility to pay H &#163;4M to buy in his preference shares. </p>

The former matrimonial home (LM House) was to be transferred to W and H was to redeem the mortgage of just under &#163;300,000 by 20th December 2006. He was to pay her a lump sum of &#163;1.1M in two instalments: &#163;200,000 by the 20th December 2006, and &#163;900,000 by 20th December 2007. There was an agreed security arrangement in relation to the second instalment, until payment of which H was to make periodical payments to W at the rate of &#163;75,000 p.a. W was by a pension sharing order to receive 50 per cent of the pension rights built up by H to that point. Finally, in relation to costs, I ordered W to pay &#163;275,000 towards those incurred by H because Calderbank correspondence disclosed that she had consistently refused offers made by H which were more favourable to her than was my determination and had made counter-offers very significantly in excess of it. In the event, however, she did not pay those costs as H offered not to enforce the costs order unless she applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal the substantive order. </p>

However, the shares had been given weight in the balancing exercise by having regard both to the approximate value of the husband's separation-date holding of shares and to his contribution to the generation of wealth unmatched by the wife. Regard had also been paid to passive economic growth and to the underlying business conducted by the husband (see paras [111]-[113]).</span></p>

The provision for W which this order requires deals fully with her needs in terms of accommodation and her ability to maintain her lifestyle while living at LM House, and indeed for her lifetime. Having arrived at the determination that she should not share proportionately as and when it may materialise in the liquidity which may be released from the T Ltd shares, I consider that the overall provision H is to make for her goes beyond those needs (taking the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">Duxbury</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> calculation simply as a guide to the size of the income-producing element) to the extent of &#163;250,000 or thereabouts, and that this is a fair result bearing in mind the burden of debt the order will impose on him over a number of years. These arrangements strike a fair balance between the obligations and entitlements flowing from this marriage and its aftermath, and achieve the parties' shared objective of securing W in LM House. I believe that this is not only a fair outcome for W but one which should obviate and protect her from the risk that T Ltd will never be brought to market, which if her final proposal were adopted would leave her with a continuing mortgage liability of &#163;300,000 to repay but without the resources to do so otherwise than by the sale of LM House.

Debate ranged about the veracity of H's assertion that there had been a significant slowdown in the number and potential value of new contracts, exacerbated by the loss of some regarded as key to T Ltd's activities and turnover. His prediction is that in the year to June 2007 the company's results are likely to revert as a result of these factors to something nearer the less healthy 2005 year picture.</span></p>

Significant expenditure of time and effort in all but a few instances lead nowhere. Over about the last 2 years only 3 out of 169 bids have proved successful. Even quite confident predictions (including public statements) do not guarantee that a deal is clinched. A number may not generate profits for a year or more because of significant start-up costs both in terms of taking on existing public-service staff and acquiring plant and equipment.</span></p>

The scale of W's inquiry on these issues has been fuelled by a belief that H has been adept to down-play and indeed to misrepresent major aspects of the company's profile, past present and prospective. This led to Mr Cusworth's submission that aspects of H's evidence which he criticised should lead me to conclude that the picture of decline in T Ltd which H presented cannot have been genuine. Although Mr Cusworth and Mr Lobbenberg in terms accepted that there had indeed been a decline, I was invited to take the view that H's gloomy and risk-laden forecast concealed a degree of optimism, and that this in turn must mean that he had covered up some salient factors which, however, despite their best efforts, W's advisers had not managed to unearth.</span></p>

His advisers accept that as the correct position, whether or not (and he says not) H understood that he was obliged to keep them posted about significant developments. Whether or not he understood that does not relieve him of the obligation to maintain his disclosure current and correct. In terms of the consequences of material non-disclosure, the vitiating effect is the same whether the non-disclosure (in the broadest sense) is innocent, deceptive or the result of mistake. But it must be material, in the sense that appropriate disclosure, if made, might have led to a materially different outcome. </p>

Whether such a time will ever come must be speculative. If it does then it will most likely have been achieved in large measure by dint of H's energy and acumen, not only past but prospective, as well as more favourable market forces than exist at present when (I am satisfied on the evidence) there is some stagnation in the company's development.

It will not then be a company of the same scale as it is now, and if this outcome is achievable at all then (as I have already indicated) it is likely to be in large part as a result of H's continuing endeavours stretching from now into the future and therefore from a point commencing a full 10 years since the parties' separation. In the particular circumstances of this case I regard that as a highly significant factor which cannot be sufficiently satisfactorily offset whether by limiting the proportion of the value payable in the future to W, nor by putting an arbitrary cap of &#163;8m upon what she might receive as was Mr Cusworth's final proposition.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Between September 2006 and March 2007 transforming events had happened. Not only had the company secured far more beneficial and generous funding from HSBC than it enjoyed (or rather laboured beneath) from its previous bankers, but new contracts had come rolling in bucking the previous years' trend. On the personal front a number of events had occurred in H's life. As emerged late in his evidence (extracted by a side wind in cross-examination, rather than volunteered) this very private individual (for so I regard H) had become engaged to remarry in February 2007. He had been worried, unnecessarily as fortunately it transpired, about his health that winter. His older brother (whose affidavit evidence W chose not to subject to cross-examination) urged him to let the company go because he was looking tired and unwell. His advice, from one point of view, was well-timed and rather than brush it aside (as I believe H earlier might well have done) he followed it up forthwith. At no notice at all he arranged to meet Mr Davies of CB at a caf&#233; the very next day. He asked him in general terms about the possibility of disposing of the company. The response of Mr Davies was extremely encouraging. Not only had the newly-won contracts transformed the prospects for increased turnover and profitability, but the acquisitions and mergers market was awash with money. Financial institutions were falling over themselves to lend fortunes. The result (as in 2008 became all too clear) was that rash and inflated purchase prices, often based on borrowed money, were competing for businesses to acquire. Mr Davies gave as an off the top of his head indication an estimate that the company might fetch about &#163;120M. In the event that was significantly exceeded, but even the price achieved was less than another competitor, not in the event favoured by H, had offered during what was I believe fairly described as a feeding frenzy. </p>

The company would thus be obliged to repay &#163;4M in respect of ICG's preference shares in the summer of 2007. To achieve that would require refinancing. The company appointed CB to advise and act for it in securing offers. That seems to have been in June 2006, and by 4th September it was tolerably clear that a total facility of &#163;35M might be available from HSBC on terms far more favourable than were available from RBS (with whom the company's directors had become increasingly dissatisfied and disillusioned, and who were not in any event prepared to advance more than &#163;27M), or indeed from the other banks prepared to offer terms of business to the company. Of this &#163;15M was earmarked as a term loan, to be drawn within one year from finalisation of the deal in December 2006, and to be used for specific purposes (including the &#163;4M payment to ICG and &#163;5M to plug a deficit in pension funds). The balance of &#163;20M available on overdraft was twice the level until then enjoyed, and meant the company would be in a position to fund expansion if (as transpired) additional contracts were secured. </p>

H's evidence was that would not be an easy nor necessarily a successful venture, but that it had to be achieved if the company was to survive. In 2009 he confirmed that it had been a very complicated and long process involving an awful lot of work, and that although after the event it all seemed very easy actually that had not been the case, and that the position might have been very different in the autumn of 2006 and thereafter if HSBC had not shown enormous keenness to do business with the company. The evidence of Mr S was to like effect: early on in 2006 he was very uncertain about the prospects of obtaining a &#163;35M to &#163;40M facility. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Linked but separate criticism is made of the fact that one of the ingredients of the &#163;15M term loan negotiated with HSBC was the facility for the company within the first year of the loan to redeem the &#163;4M of preference shares H held, mirroring the holding of ICG. The redemption of the shares was a feature of H's financial landscape which, at the hearing in May 2006, had seemed unpredictably far-off in the future: see [21] cited above. It is true that that feature had by 20th September 2006 disappeared as an obstacle if (but only if) the HSBC deal progressed to a conclusion, as indeed it did. I feel confident that had I then been informed that H might achieve the ability via anticipated refinancing to redeem his preference shares, I would not have regarded it as necessary to adjourn to await the outcome of the funding application: for my judgment proceeded on the basis that W should not share in fruits borne to H from the company. Increased personal liquidity derived from the company would not have undermined or cast doubt in my mind as to the validity of that outcome. The discussion about H's time for payment of the total of &#163;1.4M imposed upon him would have taken a different course: but in the event H paid in full and more promptly than ordained.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact is that H made no attempt to draw down this facility. His evidence was that it would have been contrary to the company's interests for him to do so, for it would have converted equity debt to a term loan and thus would have reduced its freedom of manoeuvre or 'headroom'. Both Mr S and Mr F-P were clear that H would have discussed this with them rather than just make arrangements to be repaid, and that had he done so they would have been reluctant to agree for much the same reasons as H expressed. But they would have regarded it ultimately as a decision that he as in effect the owner of the company could take unilaterally. They were however very clear that he never had discussed actually utilising the facility, and did not do so prior to the sale of the company when, in effect, he received &#163;4M for these shares from the purchasers. </p>

I suspect his two colleagues shrewdly and correctly surmised that H would regard it as a question of principle, as his preference shares were in identical terms to those of ICG, that if they were to be paid he should have the same option. He did not exercise it. His failure to clarify the developing (but still unconcluded) position prior to 20th September 2006 therefore had no material effect on the composition or quantum of my award. The potential (if it materialised) to transform his personal finances which the facility to redeem his preference shares, and indeed the payment to H of the outstanding dividends (to which I next turn), would clearly have affected the time allowed for payment of the lump sum.  </p>

H stated with certainty that there could be no question of him receiving payment before the critical &#163;4M payment to ICG due at the end of June 2007 had been made, which was his and his colleagues' prime preoccupation at that point. In the event, as I have set out, he took this pre-tax &#163;1.1M in October and November 2006 and utilised it almost immediately towards payment of the fall amount due to W. Not only did he receive this money before the ICG payment was made, but also before the HSBC banking arrangement had been finalised. It may be that by the date of these payments the HSBC facility was a foregone conclusion, subject only to the application for clearance made to the Pension Regulator which may itself have been seen as a formality. </p>

Having seen and heard H over some considerable time my view is that he drew these arrears in part because he wanted to put the ancillary relief hearing, for him as for W an emotional and upsetting experience, behind him by finalising the clean break as soon as he could. That is consistent with his evidence, which I accept, that he had made inquiries about a private bank loan to enable him to do just that but that he took instead his brother's offer of a loan to facilitate early payment. By the time of the company sale, if I have calculated correctly, H's total indebtedness to his brother had reached &#163;950,000.</p>

The first is that the bracketed range of the CB valuations - up to a top figure &#163;20M, or 40%, more than the lower figure - sheds stark light upon the tentative nature of the exercise, and is a further example of the inherent fluidity - not to say unrealistic unreliability - of unquoted company valuations. The CB number-crunchers took a different and higher EBITA multiplicand (&#163;7.2M rather than &#163;4.5M) which was however itself to some extent an<span style="font-style:italic"> estimated forecast</span>.<span style="font-style:italic"/>For the purposes of their valuations they<span style="font-style:italic"> assumed</span> that some new contracts would materialise (although in fact none was to do so for some months). They were bound, professionally and to maintain CB's good reputation (as Mr Davies made clear in his evidence), to put forward an intellectually sustainable set of figures. But inevitably their approach would be coloured by the nature of the job in hand (so far as the banks were concerned) of presenting the company as a safe and promising repository for very significant cash advances. </p>

This may serve simply to underline what seem to me to be the explanations for the increase: that the very grant of the generous HSBC facility, and (maybe most significantly) the potential profitability opened up by the new contracts, changed the profile of the company from one in the doldrums to one cresting a wave in a very liquid merger and acquisitions market. </p>

Insofar as my assessment of these subordinate considerations has been invalidated by the turn of events, and thus by a mistake about their duration and effect, I adopt the reasoning of Coleridge J, as approved at [42] of the judgment in the Court of Appeal of Wilson LJ, as to the bounce of the ball:</p>

This was the probable outcome. However the court was fully alive to the <span style="font-style:italic">possibility </span>that the payment would end up being very much larger or very much smaller. These were the possible outcomes. As far as I was concerned both possible outcomes were on the spectrum of outcomes, albeit at their outer edges, and the chances of either of them occurring was, in my judgment, the same. No one could say with any degree of confidence where the eventual outcome would fall on the spectrum and until the inquiry was concluded. The unlikely but not the impossible occurred.</p>

The whole risk arising from the liability was entirely to be assumed by the husband and the quid pro quo for that was that the husband might indeed do significantly better than the court predicted. Protecting the wife was my especial pre-occupation and concern.</p>

All in that situation should ponder Hale&#160;J&#8217;s analytical characterisation and ask themselves whether the events upon which they intend to rely can be brought within either the second or the third category.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view, and specifically on the dominant facts which led me to the 2006 judgment, this case falls within the first category. Notwithstanding misvaluation or mistake at the trial and prior to the judgment, the dramatic change in the value of the husband&#8217;s shareholding and its sale arose from natural changes in the company's circumstances combined with unusual market forces. These latter were happenings, developments or occurrences none of which it is possible to categorise as unforeseen and unforeseeable. From the wife&#8217;s perspective this does seem all terribly unfair (as Hale J observed in <span style="font-weight:bold">Cornick</span>), especially as her case throughout was that she was prepared to take risk on board in the hope of participating in whatever might be the reward. But there must be an end to litigation, and in my opinion that in this case should now have been reached.</p>
