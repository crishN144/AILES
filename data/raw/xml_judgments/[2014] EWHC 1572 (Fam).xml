Both of Ch&#8217;s parents have parental responsibility for him and, therefore, the Local Authority also applies to dispense with the consent of both parents to Ch being placed for adoption on the grounds that Ch&#8217;s welfare so requires. </p>

A report by a psychologist, Dr Hutchinson, was filed part way through this hearing and identified that F suffers from autism spectrum disorder. The facts of the case reveal behaviour by him that is a very clear manifestation of that disorder, behaviour which in an unaffected individual might be labelled as being immature, obsessively self centred, extreme and without social boundaries. The facts of the case also reveal M to be an untruthful woman who lacks emotional fortitude and adherence to truth and who also has a tendency to follow the paths of immediate convenience and expediency (as the guardian agreed in her oral evidence).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Four years prior to Ch&#8217;s birth F had pleaded guilty to two offences of downloading child pornography. He had also admitted that at the age of 15 he had sexually abused his 8 year old step-brother (for which he was not prosecuted). As a consequence the parents did not live together immediately after Ch&#8217;s birth because the Local Authority wanted to obtain a risk assessment from a Mr Steven Lowe in order to decide whether it would be safe for Ch to reside with both of his parents. And so, for nearly three months after his birth, Ch was in the sole care of M. The assessment of risk, which has been shown by subsequent events to have been lacking in its analysis, suggested that the parents could safely reunite and care for Ch together. On 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, four days after the risk assessment report was written and 6 days after the parents reunited, Ch was brought to hospital having suffered non accidental bruising to his face. Neither parent suggested any particularly level of discord between them during those six days; however the father accepts that he left the video recording mechanism on a phone running in the spare bedroom on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November when he left the house because he feared that the mother would engage in sexual activity there with another man.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the fourth day of this hearing (7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May) and after being given very clear warnings by me throughout my involvement with this case of the need to tell the whole truth about the events of 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2013, the mother filed evidence suggesting that she caused the bruising. She suggested that she did so by turning Ch&#8217;s slightly plagiocephalic head with her hand in a firm grip; that suggestion by her had begun to develop in a fourth statement that she filed on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April 2014 in which she said that she could not remember turning Ch&#8217;s head on the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November but might have done so, albeit without excessive force. </p>

	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s account of the bruising came after the lead expert, Dr George Rylance, had given evidence and written a number of reports to the effect that the injuries were non accidental and must have occurred within a timeframe that put the responsibility for them firmly on the mother. Her fourth statement, when it arrived, was sent to Dr Rylance (who had by then finished his oral evidence) and he rejected it as providing any plausible explanation for the injuries; by then the mother had also given a number of previous suggestions about possible causation which, too, were rejected with ease. The doctor further made it plain that it was not plausible to suggest that the injuries occurred before 6 a.m. on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November (from which time Ch was in the sole care of the mother until brought for medical attention that day).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Prior to the hearing and unavoidably the parents both accepted that the bruising was non accidental and suggested in court and on paper that the other parent must have been responsible. The mother&#8217;s response to the threshold document said that she accepted that the injuries were non accidental and were caused by one or other of the parents and that she was therefore &#8216;driven by logic&#8217; to say that the injuries must have been caused by F.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus the mother&#8217;s account on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April and in May was late, in contradiction to the way that she had presented her case before the hearing started and also arose only after the expert had given evidence.  What is more, her account of how she caused the injury (firmly turning his head) was obviously untrue, I find; it did not stand up to any scrutiny when it was tested in typically skilful cross examination by Mr Farquharson  on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2014. On the evidence of Dr Rylance (and in all common sense), her actions as described from the witness box would not have caused this bruising; she suggested gentle and guided turning of his head. Given the timing and her admissions of responsibility it is equally plain that she did cause the bruising and that she did so non-accidentally. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of course the burden of proof is on the Local Authority and the standard of proof required is the civil standard &#8211; the balance of probabilities. But the position is so obvious that, on the evidence that I have heard, I am satisfied well beyond the civil standard of proof that M caused the bruising and did so non accidentally. I give more details of the evidence about the bruising later in this judgment. The precise mechanism of injury cannot be stated (and it is not for anyone to guess) but it involved the use of excessive force and would have resulted in distress that she would have observed in Ch. Since 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November she has known precisely how the injury happened and, persistently, has given untruthful evidence about it.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus the immediate reason for the issue of the proceedings was non accidental injury caused to this child by the mother. Her attempt to blame the father for the bruising and her misleading of so many people in the face of clear warnings from me about the need to tell the truth add significantly to the reasons for professionals to say that she cannot be trusted. Further, by failing to tell the truth and her past attempts to deflect responsibility on to F, M has left him with a very strong and justifiable sense of grievance; that has served to fan his obsessive behaviour and lack of engagement with the court and professionals (because he knew, of course, that he could not have caused the injury for which the mother was attempting to blame him for much of these proceedings).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following a contested hearing on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> December 2013, mother and child went to Crown House in Malvern. The mother told the workers there that she had separated from F and complained to them about his behaviour. In fact, during the placement there, their commitment to each other continued and they engaged in an attempt to deceive professionals about their relationship &#8211; the mother presenting herself as a victim of F&#8217;s approaches and harassment whilst, on the other hand, encouraging those approaches in her very frequent communications with him. In her oral evidence in May 2014, the mother continued to give a false and contradictory account of her relationship with F whilst at Crown House. She sought to revert to suggesting that she was a victim of F&#8217;s harassment whilst there, whereas her own written evidence, admissions at and after an interim hearing on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014 and text messages make it plain that she was collusively and deceptively encouraging his attentions.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The placement at Crown House ended with a recommendation that Ch should not return to the community with M and that alternative arrangements should be made for his care. That recommendation was made as a result of five main things. First, the constant and destructive interference by F with Crown House and with the mother (in particular his harassment of workers by email and telephone). Secondly, the deception perpetrated by the parents about their relationship that ultimately became known with the result that the assessment only just continued after 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. Thirdly, the failure of M to work honestly with professionals generally. Fourthly, the likelihood that they would not work with professionals in the future. Fifthly, the unresolved injury to Ch.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After the breakdown of that placement it was agreed that mother and baby should go to a foster placement pending the final hearing. There the mother&#8217;s care of Ch was good but there was a constant barrage of destructive behaviour by F towards the mother and the Local Authority. Injunctions prohibiting him from contact with M were ignored by F and, consistently with his disorder, he showed no appreciation of the consequences of his actions for Ch and the mother. He tracked her down whilst there although, once again, the parents maintained an exchange of affection through text messages and meetings and intended that their relationship should continue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2014, M announced without forewarning to F that the marriage between the parents was at an end and thus their proposal to care for Ch jointly ended also. That announcement came seven days before this hearing began; the evidence leaves me entirely unpersuaded that there can be any certainty that these two parents will maintain separation in the future, for reasons that will become apparent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In a statement filed shortly before the hearing started in April [C362], M said that she believes that &#8216;there is a real risk&#8217; that F will use any opportunity that he can to harass her. That assessment by her is plainly right if they do remain apart save that, for the words &#8216;real risk&#8217; the words &#8216;very strong probability&#8217; must be substituted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the lead up to the final hearing on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April 2014, the Local Authority was proposing that Ch should reside with his maternal great aunt, D, under a special guardianship order. However, in the light of the increasingly disruptive behaviour of F, and D telling the social worker on the Friday before the hearing started on Tuesday 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April 2014 that she wished to withdraw, the Local Authority concluded that care and placement orders should be made. Thus the care plan changed just before the case started &#8211; an example of the suddenness of this is that no placement application had been made before the case started on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April 2014 (although it has now).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Over the weekend before the case started D considered her position further. She attended the court at the start of the hearing on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April and said that, after all, she did wish to be considered as a carer of Ch. I made her a party. She remained in court and participated in the hearing, having told me that she had spoken to her solicitor. Ms Claire Rowsell, counsel, attended on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April 2014 to represent her. I gave an opportunity for D to discuss matters with Ms Rowsell on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April. On the afternoon of that day D indicated that she was retiring from the case and was not wishing to pursue any applications in relation to Ch. In the light of what she heard and knew about F&#8217;s behaviour it was not remotely surprising that she did so; D has other responsibilities &#8211; she cares for her 22 year old (who has learning difficulties) and also for her seven year old child, E.  She is involved in unresolved financial remedy proceedings and has been involved in private law litigation over E. The court was told by Ms Rowsell that D accepted that she &#8216;could not keep Ch safe&#8217; and that she would &#8216;never be free&#8217; of F. D told me directly (in April) that she was 100% sure that the decision that she was making was correct.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, D came back into the case because, by May 2014 when the case resumed, it had become M&#8217;s case that she should care for Ch with the assistance of D and other members of her family. D filed a statement (now at C507) setting out her support for M (who is now living with her). She said that, since M began to live with her on the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, she (M) has changed considerably. She said that she thinks that M has not done anything wrong; she may have told a few lies, D said, but was in shock. D said that M may think that she caused the injury but that is a matter of her putting two and two together based on the medical evidence. D made her own doubts about the causation of the injury by M very clear in her evidence. She suggested that M would continue to work and that she, D, would assume responsibility for Ch for much of the time (and could share parental responsibility under a suitably worded child arrangements order). For reasons that she herself identified in April, there are obvious and profound limitations in the effective support that she would be able to offer. When faced in cross examination with the difficulties that would arise if Ch lived with her, she recognised them but said that she wished to be able to say that she had done everything that she could to keep Ch in the family.</p>

Sensibly the guardian sought permission under Part 25 of The Family Procedure Rules 2010 for the joint instruction of a psychologist. Mr Hutchinson was instructed and, shortly before the hearing resumed, wrote reports on the parents.</p>

Not only did he identify that F suffers from Autistic Spectrum disorder but he also recommended strongly that Ch should not be committed to F&#8217;s care. In relation to M, Mr Hutchinson concluded that she could offer Ch good enough parenting subject to two things: i) M&#8217;s ability to avoid the more extreme and foreseeable behaviour of F and its consequences for Ch and ii) M&#8217;s ability to work honestly and effectively with professionals. Those two qualifications are plainly interlinked since, if M were to care for Ch, she would need to remain apart from F and would need a very strong and effective body of professional support to deal with the foreseeably destructive behaviour of F (although Mr Hutchinson&#8217;s evidence was that even such a body of support and imprisonment for injunctive breach might well not be sufficient to deter F). The two qualifications raise issues of fact for me to decide on evidence.</p>

If left in the care of the mother that pattern is very likely to continue, they say. Further, the mother&#8217;s evidence about the bruising has been so untruthful that it is not possible to gain an understanding as to why she should have injured him; therefore predictions about how she would avoid similar events in the future are severely hampered. </p>

At that hearing the Local Authority and guardian pursued arguments that mother and child must be separated pending the final fixture and, after the social worker had given evidence, M agreed.</p>

All of the evidence points very firmly to its obvious lack of merit, although I will still set out in full the evidence relating to it and my reasons for accepting the Local Authority&#8217;s case in relation to him. His lack of understanding of the emotional demands of parenting, his very limited ability to care for Ch physically, his lack of engagement with professionals and profound personal, emotional and behavioural limitations make it unthinkable that this child could possibly be left in his sole care with or without his sisters&#8217; help. The evidence demonstrates very clearly indeed that no amount of services, support or therapy would enable him to adapt his functioning to a level that left him able to care for Ch in the foreseeable future. In his care, Ch&#8217;s emotional and physical care would be neglected and he would be constantly exposed to the manifestations of his father&#8217;s disorderly behaviour.</p>

Unlike the father, she is able to offer Ch adequate parenting subject to the two important qualifications identified by Mr Hutchinson.

M has given Ch adequate physical care and, in her individual relationship with him, has shown deep love and strong emotion for Ch. The risk arising from the bruising and the difficulty that the court has in identifying what preceded it should not disqualify her from caring from Ch. The bruising may have occurred: a) either in way that she knows and about which she has not told the truth; b) in the way that she has said and c) in a way that she does not fully remember. He urged me to say that the mother&#8217;s account of the injury is credible and given honestly (i.e. turning of plagiocephalic head with a firm but non-intentionally abusive grip); it is not. </p>

For reasons that will be apparent from this judgment I am left in no doubt that M has not told the truth about this injury. I am not able to find exactly how she caused it. Her lack of truthfulness, the evidence of Dr Rylance, inevitable inference about her many suggestions about caution and the circumstances of the injury demonstrate very clearly that this was non accidental injury which she caused. It also demonstrates beyond doubt her persistent lack of truthfulness.</p>

Further protective provision could arise if the &#8216;Resolutions&#8217; approach were to be adopted &#8211; that approach is to adopt the model used by the well known Bristol organisation of establishing a supportive and safe network within the community to reduce risk levels. So, Mr Carron submitted, a shared arrangement between the mother and D combined with a supervision order and a Resolutions style approach would be the correct solution for Ch whilst still maintaining him within the family. Where there is a solution that is susceptible to protective court orders the court should enforce its orders; thus if F needs to be ordered to keep away from M and Ch and cease to harass them the court must enforce its orders. The solution to enforcement is not removal of the child, he submitted.</p>

Ms Knowles submitted that, as to the risk that he might represent from the point of view of his parenting, the evidence is weak and contradictory; the Local Authority&#8217;s evidence from the parenting assessment is not mirrored to the same extent in the reports of contact. Further feedback was not given whilst the parenting assessment was underway and so there is no knowing whether F could learn to improve his emotional responsiveness to Ch. The physical risk depends upon the court&#8217;s findings and there is no reason to suggest that it would be directed to Ch. He did not cause the bruising to Ch and the true dynamics of the complex relationship with M provide an invalid basis for suggesting that he poses any physical risk to Ch.</p>

His post litigation conduct must be seen in the context of his autistic spectrum disorder and the pressure of, and reaction to, hostile litigation.

She qualified as a social worker in 2013 but has experience as a teacher and a family support worker. This is a case where it would have been very easy for the social worker to have been drawn into conflict with the parents and to have responded to the mother&#8217;s untruthfulness with irritation. I find that Miss Hughes has acted with exceptional professionalism and with appropriate detachment from the difficulties that these parents have presented. Ms Hughes has worked on this case jointly with the social worker Ms Debbie Preedy since January 2014 and Mrs Preedy  has also shown impressive professionalism in her dealings with this family. Both social workers have maintained their focus on the paramountcy of the welfare of Ch and I wish to record the very high quality of their work.</p>

Ms Hughes stressed that the Local Authority does not support the rehabilitation of Ch to M. However, in response to the questions asked of her she said that the Local Authority would need a supervision order and would then recommend contact once a month for the period of one year. At the end of the year there would have to be a review and the following questions would have to be considered: i) should an application be made for the supervision order to be extended? ii) should Ch be regarded as a child in need requiring services under Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>? and iii) should services be provided to continue with the supervision of contact?.

So he bombards social workers and others with critical communications, breaks court orders, undermines the mother in her care of Ch, lacks empathy, has poor emotional interaction with Ch and is unlikely to develop emotionally to a point where he could care for Ch.

The Local Authority does not accept that it can be stated with any reliability that F and M will remain apart. If they do, enforcement of injunctions by repeated committal is not a sensible or effective solution. If it is foreseeable (as it is) that enforcement will be necessary on a repeated basis then it is not in the interests of Ch to live in an environment where that level of harassment and enforcement is occurring. It will require M to be the instigator of enforcement and, given her lack of fortitude, that is unlikely to be a sustained feature of any arrangement for Ch.  Finally, her lack of truthfulness makes enforcement in that way unreliable. How can she be trusted to act protectively when she has not acted in that way in the past and has misled people persistently and with complexity? There is obvious strength in those submissions. So, too, was there obvious strength in the submission that, after the harassment has occurred (and it may well involve Ch) enforcement by committal would be punitive and not preventative or protective. </p>

At C264 it concluded: &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Throughout all the sessions it doesn&#8217;t look as though F takes pleasure from being with Ch; he is tense, holds Ch awkwardly and only when necessary i.e. feeding, rarely talks to him and makes no effort to engage him in any significant play. F was very matter of fact in his approach to Ch; there was no warmth toward or bond with him&#8230;F did not respond to Ch&#8217;s cues re being hungry and continually asked him &#8216;what&#8217;s the matter then? When Ch cried&#8230;F is very authoritative and opinionated abut things such as dummies&#8230;However F&#8217;s lack of knowledge about child development showed in assessment&#8230;F went through the parenting motions wit little emotional warmth towards Ch&#8217;.</span></p>

That last session is described at C261 where it is said: &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">F and M were observed to bicker to one another when they talked. F was observed to say critical comments to M about her eating habits, her clothes and comments that she made about Ch, for example she mentioned that Ch has a dummy at night, F said &#8216;that will change, I don&#8217;t want him having that&#8217;. M responded sharply by saying &#8216;well he won&#8217;t sleep without it&#8217;. M and F continued to be snappy in their communication with one another and did not show any affection or warmth to one another during the session&#8217;.</span></p>

Her particular concern was the complete lack of emotional content that she saw in his relationship with Ch; &#8216;you can teach a person the basics of parenting but you can&#8217;t teach someone how to bond,&#8217; she said. Given Mr Hutchinson&#8217;s evidence of F&#8217;s autistic spectrum disorder the results of this assessment are not remotely surprising<span style="font-style:italic">.</span></p>

The past defines the probable future. He thought that M would have significant difficulty in dealing with F&#8217;s more extreme behaviour. If M has responsibility for Ch and F does not it would be expected that his behaviour would increase to a level of obsessional harassment. If that type of harassment does develop, there is a significant risk of harm to the person who is harassed &#8211; 30 to 40% of people who are obsessionally harassed suffer physical harm, he said. Where there is a former intimate relationship, the likelihood of harm increases significantly once the relationship ends. Further, women are much more exposed to that risk of harm when the relationship ends than men. Only time will tell whether she is genuinely able to separate from him, Dr Hutchinson thought. </p>

Until such time as he moderates his behaviour it is unlikely that M (or any other carer), assuming that she maintains her separation from F, will be able to protect Ch from the consequences of F&#8217;s behaviour without significant additional help provided within a restrictive legal framework.  F has been assessed as being a medium risk of exhibiting aggressive or violent behaviour.  F is aware of the nature of his behaviour and although ASD may be a mitigating factor, it does not provide an excuse for abusive behaviour&#8217;.</span></p>

If compelled under a term of licence on release from prison to undergo therapy this might have an impact but would require that level of compulsion. For any term of imprisonment to have any impact, allowing for a significant amount of directed therapy under licence, it would have to be a long sentence &#8211; he said a sentence of at least 3 years resulting in 18 months imprisonment. Without the long term therapy it is likely that there will be explosive incidents which would put M at risk if exposed to F. A short sentence of imprisonment would not have an effect since, with F, there is a disconnect between the act committed and the punishment; he would not accept the reason for the sentence. ASD sufferers are recognised as being poor responders to prison since they do not recognise its purpose or reason.</p>

The court is not a court of social engineering. The court does not decide welfare issues by considering whether, on an individual judge&#8217;s analysis, a child might be considered to be &#8216;better off&#8217; in care or adoption. Nor does the court apply a test of whether a child will receive &#8216;optimal care&#8217; with a given parent since there would be many parents who would fail that test. Thus the court must not approach a case such as this by asking whether, on balance, a given child would be better off with adopters or with a parent.</p>

By doing so she has seriously undermined any working relationship with the Local Authority social workers and she did the same at Crown House. It is highly improbable that she would develop any form of working, reliable or long term relationship with any officer (e.g. social worker) of the Local Authority. I recognise that she developed a working relationship with Mr Lowe (although there are deficiencies in his analysis and reports) but in matters of her own conduct, relationship with F and response to supervision she has been profoundly untruthful. I cannot see any realistic prospect of any working relationship developing under which there could be any effective supervision of her care of Ch.

D has withdrawn her own wish to care for Ch twice because she knows that she &#8216;could not keep Ch safe&#8217; and that she would &#8216;never be free&#8217; of F. That still remains the position. To that must be added the inability of the family to dissuade M from continuing the relationship with F in 2011 and when she was at Crown House. So, too, must the difficulties that M&#8217;s untruthfulness would represent for the family as well.

Of the available options, it is the outcome that is the most invasive of the rights enshrined in Article 8(1) of the Convention. Nature, law and basic common sense demand that it be recognised that the best and correct place for a child to live is with a natural parent unless proven and proportionate necessarily demonstrates that is not possible. A child has a natural and profound need to be brought up within his own natural family, a need which persists throughout his life, works up and down the scales of familial generations and which can only be displaced justifiably when all else fails. Every individual seeks, if possible, the comfort, self identity and security of remaining within his natural family and environment because that is where he belongs. The natural bond and shared identity between parent and child should reinforce the developing relationship between them to create an individual&#8217;s completeness. Adults trace back their ancestry in order to understand themselves better; people who have been adopted may seek access to their files for the same reason.</p>

For M to be denied the right to care for her child is the most emotionally invasive thing that could be done to her &#8211; what loving parent would think otherwise? The orders that the Local Authority seek have lifelong consequences for them both and amount to profound changes in the circumstances of both of them. Adoption may leave an individual with a sense of loss both as a child and as an adult due to the magnetism of nature and the quest for self understanding (the Delphic maxim was purposeful: &#947;&#957;<span style="font-family:Tahoma">&#8182;</span>&#952;&#953; &#963;&#949;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957; &#8211; know thyself).</p>

She injured him at three months, exposed him to two temporary arrangements until entry to Crown house. At Crown House she comprised his welfare by seriously undermining the genuine and necessary efforts of those who were attempting to help her with his care. Throughout this case she has been untruthful about important matters relating to his welfare. Despite the events of 2011 and her own evidence of F&#8217;s past and extreme conduct, she has not acted to protect Ch from F at least until the week before this hearing started; to suggest that this is because she has been a victim of domestic abuse is simplistic, factually na&#239;ve and invalid.

However, it has always been my intention that this judgment should be placed on Bailii in anonymised form once that process was either resolved or abandoned. It now has been; the mother has received a caution for child cruelty.</p>

Such disclosure would be consistent with PD 12G of the amended Family Procedure Rules 2010 and I cannot envisage arguments that would render it inappropriate.</p>

Notice of any subsequent adoption proceedings may be given by sending that notice by first class post to the parents&#8217; last known addresses. I would ask both firms of solicitors to ensure that they make a written record that the parents have been told of this stipulation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Any adoption application must be pursued with the utmost care to ensure that confidentiality is maintained. In this case that bears a very particular importance for obvious reasons. Consideration must be given as to where any such proceedings should be issued. It seems to me that it would be appropriate for them to be issued in a location that does not reveal where any adopters may be living.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a judgment that will have a devastating effect on the parents but most particularly on the mother. I very much regret that. I would ask her solicitor to ensure that she is aware of the facilities that exist within the community for people facing such profound distress to be supported. These are young parents and I hope that both of them will develop in a way that brings them to lives that are happier than those revealed in this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I would wish to repeat my thanks to the legal representatives in this case. The demands of analysis in complex and important family cases such as this require skilful, mature and intelligent representation of all parties. It has been my privilege to witness the excellence and strength of representation that each advocate has shown and also to be the recipient of their unwavering courtesy and guidance.</p>
