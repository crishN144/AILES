I also have an application before me to lift some of the aspects of the confidentiality of the private proceedings which lie behind this contempt application so as to allow the Mother to publicise the fact that her husband is failing to comply with orders of the High Court to bring E back to the United Kingdom.  As the publicity application had the potential to affect E, I invited CAFCASS to appoint a Guardian to represent E in this hearing.  I am grateful to Ms Magson for CAFCASS for her work on this case and to Ms Holland who has provided a very helpful Position Statement on the question of publicity.</p>

On 12 January 2021, without the Mother&#8217;s knowledge, the Father took E to live in the UAE.  E has substantial autism and other disabilities and was in receipt of specialist medical support in the UK.  The Father appears to have travelled to the UAE to take up a job opportunity and has arranged for E to receive specialist support for his autism in the UAE.</p>

By that stage he had been in Dubai for several weeks and he said he had decided not to return. In that application form he said he had arrived in the UAE for &#8220;essential work reasons&#8221;.  In summary, the Father&#8217;s case that he should have permission to relocate to Dubai with E has been repeated rejected by the Court and return orders have repeatedly been made and ignored by the Father.  It follows that, prior to today&#8217;s committal application, this matter has a long procedural history which is set out in the helpful position statement of the Guardian and is summarised in the judgment of Mrs Justice Arbuthnot of 17 January 2023 as follows (save that I have made changes to anonymise the judgment which was originally given with names included):</p>

He accepts that, following difficulties caused by the pandemic, flights between UAE and the UK resumed in June 2021.  Thus, the flights resumed prior to the first date when the Father  was required to return with E, namely 7 July 2021.  However, the Father  suggests at paragraph 5 of his witness statement that, following the resumption of flights, he was unable to comply with the terms of the court order because all of the flights were fully booked.  The Father was ordered to attend this hearing in person but he has failed to do so.  If he had attended this hearing then that assertion could have been tested in cross examination, but he has not done so.  I reject that defence as it is simply not credible.  There is no detail provided to support that claim and the Father gives no details of any attempts he made to book flights for him and E.  I cannot accept that that it would not have been possible for the Father to have secured a flight from UAE to the UK before 7 July.  It cannot possibly be the case that every flight from the UAE to Europe was fully booked.  It is, in my judgment, yet another of the flimsy excuses that the Father attempts to advance for not complying with court orders.</p>

If there was any substance to that excuse, it evaporated a very long time ago.  The majority of the rest of the witness statement is an explanation by the Father about the steps that he has taken to secure appropriate specialist support for E in the UAE and his concerns as to whether this support would not be available if he were to return to England.  At no point does the Father engage with the fact that, throughout this time, E was being deprived of face to face contact with his Mother and only intermittent video contact.  He also does not engage with the fact that his attempts to justify staying in Dubai in order to meet E&#8217;s needs have been repeatedly rejected by the High Court.   These paragraphs are a repeat of the case that he advanced in opposition to the court order being made in the first place.  That case has, in my view rightly, been repeatedly rejected by the High Court.  The fact that the Father is continuing to attempt to argue but he is justified in breaching court orders because he considers that it is in E&#8217;s best interest to stay in the UAE is nothing more than an attempt to reargue a case which has been rejected.  It provides no proper basis for his refusal to comply with court orders.  The fact that a party disagrees with a court order provides no proper basis for refusing to abide by the order.</p>

Family cases, it has long been recognised, raise different considerations from those elsewhere in the civil law. The two most obvious are the heightened emotional tensions that arise between family members and often the need for those family members to continue to be in contact with one another because they have Children together or the like.  Those two factors make the task of the court, in dealing with these issues, quite different from the task when dealing with commercial disputes or other types of case in which sometimes, in fact rarely, sanctions have to be imposed for contempt of court.</span></p>

That is the only procedure which is available. Not surprisingly, therefore, the court is directing its mind to whether or not committal to prison is the appropriate order. But it does not follow from that that imprisonment is to be regarded as the automatic consequence of the breach of an order. Clearly it is not. There is, however, no principle that imprisonment is not to be imposed at the first occasion: see Thorpe v Thorpe <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 2 FLR 127" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 2 FLR 127</ref>, a decision of this court.

The full range of sentencing options is not available for contempt of court. Nevertheless, there is a range of things that the court can consider. It may do nothing, make no order. It may adjourn, and in a case where the alleged contemnor has not attended court, that may be an appropriate course to take, although I would not say so in every case. It depends on the reasons that may be thought to lie behind the non-attendance. There is a power to fine. There is a power of requisition of assets and there are mental health orders. All of those may, in an appropriate case, need consideration, particularly in a case where the court has not found any actual violence proved.</span></p>

I do not consider it would be appropriate to take either course for four reasons.  First, this is a very serious and continuing breach of court orders. The Father has been in deliberate breach of the terms of court orders for over two years.  Secondly, the Father has not just acted in breach of one court order but has breached ten orders made by the High Court.  Thirdly, his defiance of the Court is continuing.  Even at this stage, his counsel indicates to me that he has no intention of returning E from the UAE.  Hence if a lesser penalty was to be imposed it seems inevitable that its only effect would be that the Mother would have to make a further application for contempt and. on that further occasion, the court would be invited to impose a custodial sentence.    Fourthly, rather than imposing a suspended sentence, it seems to me that it would be better to allow the Father a short period of time to return to the UK with E before this order takes effect rather than imposing a suspended sentence.</p>

Accordingly, if the Father were to arrive at an airport in the UK with E, unless there is an order from the High Court reversing the decision of 27 August 2021, it may well be that E will have to go into the care of the relevant local authority in the first instance rather than going to live with his Mother.   Whilst I have no doubt that, if this were to happen, the local authority foster carers would do their best for E, such a course of action would necessarily be the best thing for E and the prospect of such an outcome may be latched onto by the Father as a further reason not to comply with the terms of this order.  In saying this I am clear that, if E returns to the UK, a court may well now conclude that, given the history of this matter, it would be in E&#8217;s best interest to go to live with his Mother.  However, that is not a decision I could make today.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">I also acknowledge that, if the Father travels from the UAE to anywhere else in the world, the immigration authorities in the country in which he is arriving are likely to discover that there is an existing warrant out for his arrest and thus he may be arrested with a view to being deported to the United Kingdom to serve this sentence of imprisonment.  That has the potential for E to be left in the UAE without the support of either parent.  It is thus manifestly in E&#8217;s interests for the Father to bring him back to the UK without delay.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">The terms of his witness statement make it perfectly clear that the Father has no present intention of complying with the terms of the court orders by returning E to the UK.   Nonetheless, in order to enable the Father to return to the UK without being instantly arrested, I am prepared to include a provision in the order which provides that the terms of this order shall be not take effect for a period of 28 days.  If the Father returns with E to the UK and thereafter remains in the UK with E within the next 28 days, the Father can be confident that he will not be arrested at the airport, although (a) both his and E&#8217;s passports will be taken from him to prevent him leaving the country again, (b) he will be required to provide the Tipstaff with details about where he will be living with E on his return to the UK and (c) a hearing should be arranged within 7 days to consider Child arrangements for E.  If that happens, the order requiring the Father to serve a term of 12 months in prison shall not take effect. Instead, the question as to what, if any, sanction shall be imposed on the Father for failing to comply with the terms of orders of the High Court will be considered at a hearing at which the Father will be able to appear and invited to purge his contempt.  </p>

The Mother already has limited permission to release a photograph of E, to name him, to name the Father and to publicise the fact that the Father has failed to comply with return orders.  She asks for an extension of that order to include the following:</p>

However, that information will not make any real sense to a reader unless the Mother is able to set out the background to the order of imprisonment.  She has asked for this publicity in order to seek to put pressure on the Father and also in the hope that it will enable her to raise funds to be able to seek orders in the courts in the UAE to require the Father to return with E to the UK.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Father, through Ms Fielding, strongly opposes the suggested order on the grounds that this will adversely affect his life in Dubai and may lead to the loss of his job, and that would prejudice his ability to support E.  He is also concerned about the wider damage to his reputation and the adverse effect that this will have on his other Children.  The Guardian rightly reminds me that the primary aim of the Court is not to punish the Father but to protect E and to secure his return to the UK.  She accepts that the threat of publication may place pressure on the Father and thus may lead to him agreeing to return to the UK with E.  As a result, the Guardian does not oppose the making of the order.  </p>

Those factors do not justify him not being named as someone who has breached court orders but there is a chance that the threat of the adverse effects of publicity made lead the Father to accept that it is in his best interests to comply with the terms of the court orders.  Publicity may also assist the Father to gain much needed funding to allow her to litigate in the UAE if the Father continues to defy the court orders.  </p>

It is in E&#8217;s best interests for the Father to comply with the court orders and, to further E&#8217;s interests, I am prepared to suspend the terms of any order committing publicity for 28 days to allow the Father a final chance to resolve his affairs in Dubai and to comply with the terms of the court order and to return to the UK with E.  However, if he fails to take this opportunity, in my judgement the balance comes down firmly in favour of allowing the Mother to publicise the fact that her son has been kept away from her for the last three years by her husband who is defying orders of the High Court in doing so.</p>
