She has been living in a care home for the last eighteen months, having been transferred from her home in Surrey where she had lived for sixty-five years. Until five years ago she lived there with her husband until he died. In early 2017 CB was admitted to hospital following a fall and persistent urinary tract infections. She was in hospital for eleven weeks. On discharge CB went to live in a care home in Epsom. She did not like the care home at all and so her nephew, CM, arranged for some practical alterations to be made to her home to enable her to move back in. She was able to do so by April 2017. CM holds Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPA) in respect of CB&#8217;s health and welfare as well as her property and affairs.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">CM lived with his aunt for a month at her home but found it very difficult to cope. She had a recurrence of urinary tract infection and became disorientated. She had a package of care in place that initially provide for care visits, but this was changed to &#8220;live in&#8221; care. Accordingly, somebody was with her twenty-four hours per day. It appears to be common ground between the parties that CB would wander, sometimes in the middle of the night. The police had to be called on several occasions and neighbours were disturbed. By the 19 September 2017 the situation had reached a crisis point and CB was transferred to her present home.  </p>

The author of the report, Dr Ajiteru, a consultant in old age psychiatry also considered that CB did not have the capacity: to conduct proceedings; to make decisions about where to live; to make decisions about the care she receives; to make decisions about her property and finances or to make or rescind a lasting Power of Attorney. Dr Ajiteru was unable to say whether CB would have had capacity to make or rescind a Power of Attorney in May 2017, when it was authorised in favour of her nephew.  </p>

The OS&#8217;s position in relation to CB&#8217;s best interests was that further disclosure was required. The Judge made an order for the Sec 49 MCA report (see para 5 above) and for third party disclosure. The substantive directions required the Local Authority to file and serve evidence, by 2 August 2018, addressing: any physical adjustments to the property required; details of care package which would enable CB to return to her home; the costs involved.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I consider that the Judge was entirely right to refuse to vacate the hearing. It should be borne in mind that CB, by this stage, had already been in the care home since September 2017 (i.e. fourteen months). Prior to that she had spent eleven weeks in hospital and two months in her own home. The Judge had expert evidence pointing out, that which I do not consider to be controversial, namely that disruption is extremely distressing to individuals in CB&#8217;s situation.  I cannot see how the timescales taken to address these issues can possibly be reconciled with CB&#8217;s own timescales. It is axiomatic that at 91 years of age CB does not have time on her side. </p>

CM appeared in person, as he does today. The Judge heard short representations from counsel. She also heard from CM who, inevitably as an unrepresented person, gave evidence rather than confining himself to submissions. It is clear that the Judge placed a good deal of weight on what CM had to say. In particular she accepted CM&#8217;s account of the deficiencies in the arrangements for 24-hour care. </p>

He says this: &#8216;One must take into consideration 24-hour care in CB&#8217;s own private residence compared with 24-hour care in a care setting.  The challenges of 24-hour care at home include issues around funding of such care, levels of expertise that will be available for CB for complex issues such as medication management and management of her behaviours such as confusion and wandering at night time.  On the one hand, 24-hour care in her own home may provide her with the opportunity to be in her own home/space, which contains her treasured memories&#8217;.  I would put in there, of course, that is important.  &#8216;However, experience&#8217;, and this is CM&#8217;s experience &#8216;has shown that this has been tried in the past and has failed for various reasons, resulting in a significant degree of risk to both CB and risk of carer stress and burnout.  The advantage of care in a 24-hour setting is that there is a range of skilled staff with the right expertise to mitigate risk of carer stress and burnout.  In addition, care in a 24-hour placement also provides CB with the opportunities for socialisation&#8217;.  </span></p>

As I have indicated above, the real potential for harm caused by delay demonstrates that the existence of this summary jurisdiction may sometimes provide a very powerful protection for P (in that it will facilitate the avoidance of delay). Mr Lewis accepted that this summary power exists even where the court is evaluating the proportionality of a deprivation of liberty, engaging, as it always will, Article 5 rights. I asked him whether he could imagine a factual scenario which engaged P&#8217;s Article 5 rights but which would nonetheless permit of a summary resolution. He could not think of any, neither can I.   Nonetheless, I agree with him. I am satisfied that the power exists even though it may be largely theoretical. Judge Horowitz put it in this way: </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.49in"><span style="font-style:italic">But such summary power is, in my judgment, to be exercised appropriately and with a modicum of restraint. The power to make an order of the court's own initiative without hearing the parties or giving them an opportunity to make representations does not extend as was done here to engagement in that procedure at the outset of a hearing in which the parties were in attendance all the more so in expectation of procedural and no other steps. It is plainly a power to be exercised as an alternative to a hearing and in the proper case such as an emergency or where there is little or no apparent contest anticipated to the exercise of the court's powers. It is not likely to be an appropriate power to be exercised where the outcome is a deprivation of liberty in circumstances where there is a serious issue or potential issue whether that is appropriate and so where Arts 5 and 6 are potentially both engaged.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">As I indicated above, it is submitted by the Official Solicitor that in dismissing a case, where no party has requested it, in circumstances where an individual&#8217;s rights under Article 5 are engaged, there is a breach of both Article 5 and 6. It strikes me that this generalised submission cannot easily be reconciled, if at all, with Mr Lewis&#8217;s early concession that the power to deal with the application summarily exists in law. Nor can this be accommodated comfortably with his later argument that Judge Backhouse erred in &#8220;an inappropriate and wrongful exercise of discretion&#8221;. Whilst Article 5 undoubtedly falls to be considered here, these submissions, if Mr Lewis will forgive me for saying so, are too elaborate.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The simple issue is whether the Judge had sufficient information before her to discount, at this stage, any real possibility of CB returning to her home, supported by the extensive and expensive care package that is being mooted. The language of the Judgment itself, to my mind, answers this question in phrases such as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I very much doubt&#8230;. I am very sceptical&#8230;. The practicalities are&#8230;. likely to be extremely difficult&#8230;.&#8221; </span>I share the Judge&#8217;s scepticism and I also very much doubt that even with an extensive package of support a return home will be in CB&#8217;s best interest. I note too that Dr Ajiteru expressed himself in cautious terms (see para 10 above). However, scepticism and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;doubt&#8221;</span> is not sufficient to discount a proper enquiry in to such a fundamental issue of individual liberty. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The powerful counter veiling factors have been identified by CM at this hearing, in a document that he produced. I permitted him to file and serve it. I also permitted the Local Authority to file an updating statement from Patrick Osakwe, who is the social worker employed by them. From these two documents emerge several key facts: CB presently requires monitoring every fifteen minutes during the day and every thirty minutes at night; she is unable to identify when she needs her inhaler; she is very unsteady on her feet and prone to fall. CM regards a return home as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a lottery&#8221;</span>. By this he means a risk that is not worth taking, in circumstances where his aunt is well cared for and well looked after in a care home which he regards highly and where there are staff who have been working there, as he points out, for at least ten years. His simple but cogent argument is: why take the risk? He reminds me that he lives nearby and takes his aunt to all her hospital appointments and for occasional drives out to lunch, when she feels up to it. He notes that she never expresses any resistance on a return to the home, though I gather from all concerned that she rather enjoys the role of the curmudgeon. To all this I add Dr Ajiteru&#8217;s incontestable point that there are serious risks inherent in any upheaval. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is easy to see why the Judge took the course she did and I have a good deal of sympathy with her. She will have recognised, as do I, that the effluxion of time has had its own impact on the viability of the options in this case. However, what is involved here is nothing less than CB&#8217;s liberty. Curtailing, restricting or depriving any adult of such a fundamental freedom will always require cogent evidence and proper enquiry. I cannot envisage any circumstances where it would be right to determine such issues on the basis of speculation and general experience in other cases.</p>

As was pointed out by those appearing before the Court, the paragraph is not concerned with mere restrictions on liberty of movement; such restrictions are governed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2) which has not been ratified by Italy. In order to determine whether someone has been "deprived of his liberty" within the meaning of Article 5 (art. 5), the starting point must be his concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see the Engel and others judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 24, par. 58-59).&#8221; </span></p>

It may be that those rights have sometimes to be limited or restricted because of their disabilities, but the starting point should be the same as that for everyone else. This flows inexorably from the universal character of human rights, founded on the inherent dignity of all human beings, and is confirmed in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Far from disability entitling the state to deny such people human rights: rather it places upon the state (and upon others) the duty to make reasonable accommodation to cater for the special needs of those with disabilities.  </span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.49in"><span style="font-style:italic">Those rights include the right to physical liberty, which is guaranteed by article 5 of the European Convention. This is not a right to do or to go where one pleases. It is a more focussed right, not to be deprived of that physical liberty. But, as it seems to me, what it means to be deprived of liberty must be the same for everyone, whether or not they have physical or mental disabilities. If it would be a deprivation of my liberty to be obliged to live in a particular place, subject to constant monitoring and control, only allowed out with close supervision, and unable to move away without permission even if such an opportunity became available, then it must also be a deprivation of the liberty of a disabled person. The fact that my living arrangements are comfortable, and indeed make my life as enjoyable as it could possibly be, should make no difference. A gilded cage is still a cage.&#8221; </span></p>
