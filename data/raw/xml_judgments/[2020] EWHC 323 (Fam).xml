The extent of the family court&#8217;s jurisdiction extends only to respectfully invite the Secretary of State to take the order into account, and for relevant tribunals to consider any determinations made by the Court in FGMA proceedings. </p>

The approach to risk is not the same as that taken in a family case. In a family case, establishing risk is a two-stage process. First, the court considers what facts are established on the balance of probabilities; then it proceeds to consider whether those facts give rise to a risk of harm, see <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (Children) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/9" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 9" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 9</ref>. In contrast, in an asylum/humanitarian protection claim, the material presented by the claimant is looked at as a whole with a view to determining whether there is a well- founded fear of persecution or substantial grounds for believing that a person would face a real risk of serious harm, a reasonable degree of likelihood of serious harm being what is required. There is no comparable process of searching for facts which are established on the balance of probabilities." </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">So, the approach to risk assessment in a family case is a different exercise from that undertaken in the context of immigration and asylum. The family court has a duty by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31" uk:canonical="2003 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FGMA 2003</ref>, Schedule 2, paragraph 1(2) to 'have regard to all the circumstances' and, to discharge that duty, the court must consider all the relevant available evidence before deciding any facts on the balance of probability and then moving on to assess the risk and the need for an FGMPO. Although the Family Court will necessarily take note of any FTT risk assessment, the exercise undertaken by the FTT is not a compatible process with that required in the family court. It is not therefore possible for a FTT assessment to be taken as the starting point or default position in the family court. The Family Court has a duty to form its own assessment, unencumbered by having to afford priority or precedence to the outcome of a similarly labelled, but materially different, process in the immigration jurisdiction.  On that issue permission to appeal has just been granted by King LJ. </p>

FGM is a generic term for a range of procedures which involve the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons; it serves as a complex form of social control of women's sexual and reproductive rights. In 1997, the World Health Organisation ('WHO') together with the United Nations Children's Fund and the United Nations Population Fund jointly classified FGM into four types; see the identification and discussion of these types in domestic caselaw (see Sir James Munby P in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B &amp; G (No.2)</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"> [2015]</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">EWFC 3 at [7])</span>.  </p>

The justifications and motivations are generally based on a belief that FGM brings status and respect to the girl, it preserves a girl's virginity/chastity, it is said to be part of being a woman, it is a rite of passage, it gives a girl social acceptance, especially for marriage, it upholds the family "honour", it cleanses and purifies the girl. Some who support the practice have sought to eliminate risks of infection (by, for example, carrying out the procedure in a medical environment), this gives the appearance of legitimising FGM. But FGM signifies a woman's subservience and obedience to men.   </p>

There are multiple serious harmful consequences of FGM for any young girl or woman, which, short term, can include severe pain, shock, haemorrhage, wound infections, urinary retention, injury to adjacent tissues, genital swelling, and/or death.  Among the longer-term consequences are genital scarring, genital cysts and keloid scar formation, recurrent urinary tract infections and difficulties in passing urine, possible increased risk of blood infections such as hepatitis B and HIV, pain during sex, lack of pleasurable sensation and impaired sexual function, psychological concerns such as anxiety, flashbacks and post-traumatic stress disorder, difficulties with menstruation, complications in pregnancy or childbirth, and/or increased risk of stillbirth and death of child during or just after birth. It is obvious and evident from the mother that devastating and long-term psychological and physical effects of the procedure endure. </p>

I bear in mind too that the mother is not only suffering from PTSD, as well as anxiety and depression, but very obviously required the assistance of an intermediary, something which has not been available to her before and which she obviously needed.  I bear in mind too that other factors, such as immigration status, also bear on the lay witnesses and their perspectives.  It is entirely possible, indeed rather more than possible, that the Court has not heard the truth, either from the mother, or in respect of the father, in order to hide her true feelings, motives or intentions.  But just because she may have told lies earlier or not, or is untrustworthy or unreliable in respect of some aspects, does not mean it applies to everything (<span style="font-style:italic">R v Lucas </span>1987 QB720), and may be a very long way from being determinative having regard to the overall canvass, and other (expert opinion) which is available to the Court. </p>

The plan is to move the case to a different team which may have some advantages.  But A needs someone to take responsibility for her case. Specialist Immigration advice needs pursuing, a firm has already been identified; life story work is required; financial assistance is also required to enable A to learn Arabic, as well as quite delicate education on topic of FGM, about which A currently knows nothing.  I was very impressed with the social worker who seemed to me to be both naturally intuitive and supportive, as well as proactive, even where topics might be outside her usual experience. </p>

The negative impact on the mother&#8217;s mental health if the family were to be removed to either Bahrain or Sudan would render her less able to provide protection for A, particularly in the context of the family and cultural expectations and the patriarchal hierarchy in Bahrain and Sudan. This is supported by the assessment of Dr Ratnam, who assessed the mother to be suffering from depression, anxiety and PTSD, which will not be amenable to treatment until the mother is in a stable situation. The mother reports also suffering poor physical health, which will be further impacted by the stress and anxiety she is currently experiencing. From my own observations of the mother at the early stage of these proceedings and interviewing her recently, I observed her emotional presentation to have deteriorated. Dr Ratnam concluded there would be a further negative impact upon the mother if deported, which in turn would impact on the care and protection she could provide to A and her other children,  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">Whilst a very long way from being determinative, within the prism of my enquiry, I do not find the mother inconsistent or unreliable.  Circumstances and the clarity of the evidence have significantly changed since 2017.  The mother came to this country having made elaborate plans to do so.  Her express motivation was the protection of A.  In the context of a different marital relationship, and a family who were (and are) united in their zealous support for FGM, the mother took a courageous stand.  Since then the evidence today is much clearer, putting her journey for protection in a clear perspective.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">On 31 August 2012 the mother applied for asylum citing her risk of harm due to her conversion to Shia Islam practice and A&#8217;s risk of being subjected to FGM.  Her claim was rejected and the Secretary of State&#8217;s refusal was upheld on appeal by the First Tier and Upper Tribunals. A was a dependant - not a claimant or an appellant in the asylum process.  </p>

Campaigning efforts by UN and NGO agencies are assessed to have brought &#8216;very little change or impact in terms of reducing the prevalence rates of FGM in Sudan.&#8217; </p>

He is stated to support the practice of FGM and has shown deference to his family on this issue. The mother reported that it was the father&#8217;s intention to take A to The Sudan to undergo the procedure and that he had last mentioned this to her in 2015. The father cannot be considered a protective factor against the risk of FGM.  </p>

Secondly, the order will have no real effect either in Bahrain or Sudan. </p>
