The difference in the application of the principles set out below results from the fact that the Property is, and at all relevant times has been, the wife&#8217;s home while 67 KR is the home of the husband and the Second Appellant.</p>

This interest was not affected by the husband&#8217;s bankruptcy and was not waived or otherwise lost during the bankruptcy.  Without, at this stage, going into any detail, the judge also decided that the wife&#8217;s interest remains enforceable against the husband and the Second Appellant.  She decided, alternatively, that the Declaration of Trust dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2014 (&#8220;the Declaration of Trust&#8221;), by which the husband and the Second Appellant declared, among other things, that the husband held the properties for the benefit of the Second Appellant alone, should be set aside under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> (&#8220;the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>&#8221;).  </p>

Accordingly, I directed the parties to file submissions dealing with the enforceability of the wife&#8217;s equitable charge (on the basis that such exists) against the husband and the Second Appellant as purchasers of property from the trustee in bankruptcy.  All three parties have provided additional written submissions.</p>

He also remarked, in response to the husband&#8217;s submissions, that the trustees could only sell &#8220;what they had&#8221; and that the wife&#8217;s rights, if she had any, did not vest in the trustees.</p>

They submit that the order should be interpreted having regard to what the parties intended it to provide, which can be seen from the actions of the wife, her solicitors and the family court.  That there was no intention to give the wife security is demonstrated, for example, by the fact that she agreed to remove the, and withdraw her application for a, restriction and by the letter written to the court by her solicitors on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2012 (adjourning the proceedings because of the bankruptcy).

The essential element of an equitable charge is that, in the event of a default by the debtor in the payment of his debt, the chargee is entitled to an order for the sale of the charged property and for the payment of his debt out of the proceeds of sale &#8230; The present case is in our view a stronger case for the creation of an equitable interest.  The obligation under the agreement is an unqualified one to sell the property and to pay the proceeds of sale to the company &#8230; in settlement of the company&#8217;s claim &#8230; The property is wholly appropriated to that settlement&#8221;.</p>

In the event of default in payment of any instalment of the lump sum, the order gives the wife the immediate right to sell the properties and to the payment of the lump sum due from the proceeds of sale, the very rights which Ward LJ identifies as being the essential elements of an equitable charge creating an equitable interest.</p>

I have been unable to find an authority which deals directly with the rights created by such an order.  However, if further support were required for my conclusion, and although it was not referred to during the hearing before me (it was referred to at the hearing before Registrar Baister), the decision of <span style="font-style:italic">Mountney v Treharne</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] Ch. 135" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] Ch. 135</ref> would provide such support.  In that case it was decided that a transfer of property order gave the wife an equitable interest applying, what is called, the <span style="font-style:italic">Maclurcan</span> line of authority after the case of <span class="Emphasis" style="color:#000000">Maclurcan v Maclurcan </span><span style="color:#000000">(1897) 77 LT 474.

The same principle would clearly apply in respect of a lump sum order and, in my view, with greater force in respect of an order for sale made to secure payment of a lump sum.</span></p>

She refers in her proof of debt to her having security.  She referred in the correspondence with the trustee to her having an interest in the properties.  The fact that she did not put a value on her security can be explained, as stated by the cousin, by her lack of knowledge of the relevant facts needed to place a value on it (which would probably have been available to her if the husband had complied with his disclosure obligations under the various orders referred to above).  Also, as referred to below, the rules do not suggest that, by voting, a secured creditor is treated as having surrendered or given up their rights.

The requirement to obtain the leave of the court to re-value the security for the purposes of the bankruptcy cannot affect the nature of the security.  Given that the trustee never sought to obtain any determination as to the extent of the wife&#8217;s interest in the properties; that he acquired the properties subject to her interest; and that the Settlement Agreement refers only to any interest the trustee &#8220;may&#8221; have in the properties, I do not consider that this rule has the effect of depriving the wife of her interest in the properties.  Further, it is clear from IR 1986, rule 6.119 that the previous provisions (including rule 6.115(2)) only affect the value put on the security for the purposes of the bankruptcy and not the actual value of the security.  Under rule 6.119, the amount subsequently realised by the secured creditor is automatically treated as the value.</p>

These bald assertions do not begin to establish that the Second Appellant had any interest in the properties prior to 2014.  If she had any such interest, I have no doubt that this would have been advanced by her and/or the husband at a far earlier stage of the proceedings (including in 2009).

It is clear that the husband and the Second Appellant considered that he remained the sole registered owner of the properties pursuant to the 2014 transactions.  The Declaration of Trust refers to him (and him alone) holding the properties on trust.  The question, therefore, is how might there have been a transfer of the legal estate by the trustee to the husband which transfer was registrable under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/9/section/27" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 27</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/9" uk:canonical="2002 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LRA 2002</ref>?</p>

As referred to above, the Settlement Agreement merely required the trustee to remove any restriction registered against the properties.  Removing a restriction is not the same and does not have effect as, as submitted by the Appellants, the transfer of a registered estate nor, as they also submit, the registration of a disposition.</p>

However, as referred to above, because the husband remains the sole registered owner of the properties, if a transfer has already been effected by the trustee in bankruptcy, it has clearly only been a transfer to the husband.</p>

It does not apply to 67 KR.  Accordingly, the priority of the wife&#8217;s proprietary interest would be protected in respect of the Property (but not 67 KR) even if there has been, or were to be, a registrable disposition completed by registration.</p>

The simple answer is that, even making the assumptions which I have, there has been or would have been no conveyance with the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Law of Property Act 1925</ref>.

I appreciate the apparent strength of the wife&#8217;s case.  However, I consider that the judge was wrong to determine this application on submissions alone.  The Second Appellant, as a litigant in person, was significantly disadvantaged in not having any opportunity to give any evidence to seek to explain the circumstances in which she entered into the Declaration of Trust.  She was entitled to have an opportunity to give evidence on the matters relevant to the determination of whether the Declaration was a reviewable disposition.</p>
