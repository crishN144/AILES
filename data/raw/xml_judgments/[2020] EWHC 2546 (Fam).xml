It alleges that, following his bankruptcy on 21 June 2017, Mr Becker gave a false account of the scale of his assets to his trustees in bankruptcy. There are 19 separate charges in all. Some of the charges are extremely serious. It is said that the scale of his non-disclosure, assessed conservatively, is around &#163;6 million.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following his bankruptcy Mr Becker was required to complete, under penalty of perjury, a questionnaire about his assets. On 6 July 2017 the completed questionnaire was sent to the Official Receiver. It was not, however, signed. Nobody has suggested that the absence of a signature makes any difference.  On page 10 Mr Becker filled in section 2.1(n) as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 13 September 2017 Mr Becker attended a meeting with the trustees in bankruptcy and explained that the property was put into trust for his daughter&#8217;s benefit until she finished her education. When asked what would happen at that point Mr Becker replied, &#8220;it belongs to a trust; I cannot give you any more details about that, so basically, I do not know&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the meeting, however, Mr Becker handed over a copy of the deed of settlement. This covers 20 pages and sets out in specific detail, in the usual form, the terms of the trust. It provided chapter and verse about Mr Becker&#8217;s reversionary interest. There was nothing else to be known about it. To establish the value of Mr Becker&#8217;s reversionary interest all that was needed was a professional valuation of the flat which would be suitably discounted to reflect the tenure of the daughter for the next six years or so. But that was not Mr Becker&#8217;s to give.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am therefore somewhat at a loss to understand Charge 12. Mr Becker clearly referred to the existence of the trust in his answer to the questionnaire and provided nine weeks later the fullest possible details of it by supplying an actual copy of the deed. If I understood Ms Magennis correctly the complaint is that Mr Becker did not in his answer to the questionnaire spell out in sufficient detail the terms of the trust, but only did so nine weeks later. In comparison to the other charges this complaint seems trivial.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By 2015 Mr Becker had fallen into arrears of child maintenance. He claimed that he had run out of money. Enforcement proceedings came before Sir James Munby P on 22 April 2015. In his order of that day the President ordered Mr Becker to file and serve a statement, made on oath, by 21 May 2015 which gave a detailed explanation for his failures since 1 January 2015 to comply with his maintenance obligations; and either (i) confirmation that he will be able to meet those obligations in the future, or (ii) full particulars of his case as to why he could not to include full details of his income, assets, and other financial resources which he has or may have in the reasonably foreseeable future anywhere in the world and howsoever held. While it is true that this order was not endorsed with a penal notice it is clear that the statement in question would be extracted from Mr Becker by compulsion. If there were any doubt about that it was resolved on 22 January 2016 when the President reiterated the order, but with a compliance date of 4 February 2016. This time the order was endorsed with a penal notice.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The statement eventually emerged on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>February 2016. There can be no doubt that it was extracted from Mr Becker under compulsion. As such, its contents would be inadmissible in any subsequent criminal proceedings: see <span style="font-style:italic">R v K</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] QB 343" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] QB 343</ref>. Had Mr Becker sought to argue that he should not be required to make the statement because he might incriminate himself he would have been told that <span style="font-style:italic">R v K</span> decides that the privilege was not available to him but that the quid pro quo was that the statement would not be admissible in any criminal proceedings.

This is a strangely neglected provision which should receive far greater prominence. No order prohibiting publication of the orders has been made in this case. </p>

This extends to the order of 22 April 2015, which the property trustee provided on 17 September 2020, the day before the hearing before me. Mr Caplan QC does not resist a declaration being made to that effect.</p>

FPR Part 12 does not apply to Schedule 1 proceedings; they are financial remedy proceedings governed by Part 9. Therefore, the application is to be considered under FPR r 22.20. This provides that in financial remedy proceedings under Part 9 a witness statement may be used only for the purpose of the proceedings in which it is served save where the court gives permission for some other use. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An application by a prosecuting authority to use a witness statement in criminal proceedings brought in the public interest may well be a proper purpose. On such an application the court will consider first, the considerable public importance in facilitating the effective prosecution of serious crimes; second, that the prosecutor had a duty to lay before the criminal court all the evidence relevant to the offences charged, and would be hindered in so doing if evidence that would otherwise be relevant was withheld by the court; and third that where no privilege against self-incrimination had been asserted in the civil proceedings, it was for the Crown Court to determine this issue, if it later arose: <span style="font-style:italic">Gilani v Saddiq</span>.
