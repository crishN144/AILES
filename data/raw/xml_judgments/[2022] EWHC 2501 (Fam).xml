However, it is the father&#8217;s firm position that must not be subject to a strict timetable but should be taken at C&#8217;s pace.  The father contended that the mother&#8217;s contact must be supervised and that it should be supervised by, as currently, C&#8217;s nanny and not a professional organisation, and that the mother&#8217;s contact should be restricted to four times a year only.  In addition, he opposed the making of the prohibited steps orders sought on behalf of the mother.  </span></p>

The mother&#8217;s case is that it should be maintained at its current level of twice a week.  It is the father&#8217;s case that it should reduce down to once per two weeks.  The Guardian supported the position of the father.  All parties are agreed that these proceedings should come to an end at the conclusion of this hearing.</span></p>

What has happened since the last hearing in August 2021?  In broad terms, the mother has continued with her regular communication with the West Midlands Police and has sought to drive the West Midlands Police into investigating the complaints that she made to them about the father, and to seek his prosecution for what she says were the criminal offences that he had inflicted upon her.</span></p>

Earlier this year, the mother&#8217;s frustration with the West Midlands Police was vented on the officer in the case with complaints of incompetence on the part of their investigation.</span></p>

He set out in that email the victim&#8217;s right to seek a review of the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service.  On the same day, the mother notified PC X that she did seek a review of the CPS&#8217;s decision.  This review is ongoing at the date of this hearing.  </span></p>

		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.58in;margin-right:0.37in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;Although C would be physically well cared for by his mother, I have come to the same conclusion that I did in my August 2020 judgment, namely that if C were to live with his mother the prospects of him enjoying a meaningful relationship with his father are poor at best and non-existent at worst.  Unless there is a sea change in the attitude of the mother and of members of the maternal family towards the father, C would be exposed to false and negative views about his father which undoubtedly would be harmful to his emotional and psychological wellbeing.  I fear the prospects of any such sea change in the mother are poor.</span></p>

I can only make an informed decision about the degree and nature of Mother&#8217;s future contact post the conclusion of her chemotherapy once I know; (1) the decision of the CPS in respect of the police investigation and (2) the mother&#8217;s reaction to the same.  If there is no change in the stance of the mother, it is most likely, given the risk of harm to C, that her contact would have to be limited to infrequent visiting contact and be supervised.  I know that C enjoys seeing his mother and, therefore, his welfare best interests require me to have the best evidence available to me to determine where the balance of harm falls between frequent and unrestricted contact with his mother or sadly very infrequent and supervised visiting contact&#8221;.</span></p>

With ongoing indirect video contact, which has been supervised by C&#8217;s nanny and has been of a high quality, it will maintain the relationship between C and his mother so that, in my judgment, he would well cope with seeing his mother on six occasions a year.
