	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These proceedings concern W, who is 13 years of age and suffers from multi-system problems, arising from a rare gene mutation. His needs are complex and there is an ever-present risk of an acute life-threatening event. Accordingly, he requires 24-hours per day care, 7 days a week. Such are his needs that care must be provided on a 2:1 ratio. It would be too easy to see W as the raft of his needs and complex problems but to characterise him in this way would be to fail to do justice to his extraordinary personality. Whilst his capacity is limited in so many aspects of his functioning, he has a seemingly fathomless reserve of love for those around him and an engaging receptivity to the love he receives from others, most particularly, his family. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">W, within the parameters set by his condition, enjoys spending time with other people, both with children and adults. He thrives on this social interaction. Though it is necessary for his food to be pur&#233;ed, he greatly enjoys it and, I sense from what I have heard, dines like a King. Latterly, it has been necessary to put him on a diet. W is adept at communicating his wishes and feelings non-verbally but when he is unable to do so, he gets very frustrated. Those who encounter him frequently describe him as adorable and a cheeky, engaging personality. He is a great and a loyal fan of the television broadcaster, Dermott O&#8217;Leary. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The plan for W is that he should live at home. His parents share parental responsibility for him with Lancashire County Council, under the aegis of an interim care order, first made by HHJ Burrows on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2021 and subsequently renewed. Since June this year, W has been at home every day, and since August, he has frequently been staying overnight, at very least, two nights per week. He receives, what his parents rightly perceive as, excellent care from the Alder Hey Children&#8217;s Hospital. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Recruiting, training, and retaining care staff in the present challenging climate, is in this case, as in many others, proving to be difficult. Three candidates have been recruited and trained and three more have been identified, interviewed, and considered to be suitable for training. Ms E, the key social worker, told me that which I have heard in other cases, namely that care workers of this kind are now very rare and much sought-after personnel, frequently lured away by competingly attractive employment packages and prospects of promotion. Many applicants who evince an interest in advertised posts, simply, Ms E tells me, fail to follow through. Added to all this, are the ongoing challenges faced by the continuing Covid-19 pandemic which can take crucial workers out of the arrangements at short notice and create real problems for the efficacy and safety of the plan. The parents recognise and understand these pressures within the system, but it generates inevitable stress. </p>

Intrinsic to this, is a recognition that the relationship in the past had failed, due to the stresses and pressures on both sides and, it requires to be said, failings on both sides.

The sharing of parental responsibility with parents involves a Local Authority assuming a significant and, in many cases, predominant share of parenting responsibilities. Inevitably, this generates both expense and time. Sometimes, it will be expedient for a Local Authority to seek to discontinue proceedings. For this reason, it is recognised that the decision must always be a determination of the Court.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The essence of the claim is that both the Local Authority and the ICB propose to act in a way which is incompatible with Article 8, by implementing a care package in which the burden placed on the parents generates a situation in which W&#8217;s safety is compromised. The remedy sought by the parents does not seek damages but is entirely limited to declaration. The claim is brought within the Children Act proceedings to reinforce the fundamental importance of a sufficiently resourced care plan, in which the family is appropriately supported. Ms Cavanagh asserts that the Local Authority collated evidence, now 7 months ago, seeking a final care order. That evidence, she suggests, has not evaporated. She suggests that it has now become inconvenient for the Local Authority. If these proceedings fall away, so too, inevitably, does the HRA claim. That, says Ms Cavanagh, is the reason the Local Authority now seek permission to withdraw. It is, she suggests, pure <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;expediency&#8221;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The structures around W are framed in the language of medicine and social care. Shifts are allocated and divided, in response to W&#8217;s needs. When M talks about taking on &#8216;shifts&#8217;, she is, in my judgement, applying the lexicon which surrounds her son into which she has inevitably migrated. Ms E has, at least to some degree, overstated the significance of this, in my judgement. She interprets it as the mother commodifying her care as if it were to be equated with and evaluated on a par with the professional carers. I do not believe, having listened carefully to both, that this is correct. That is not to say that I accept, without reservation, M&#8217;s criticism of the extent to which she is personally required to support the care plan. The plan is, at present, incomplete and untested. It has not had the chance properly to be evaluated. Half of the available carers are not yet trained.  M&#8217;s anxieties strike me as entirely understandable but that does not mean that they will be realised. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This mother may talk about &#8220;work&#8221; and &#8220;shifts&#8221;, but her dedication to W is manifest and abundant. The child I have described in some detail above is one who has had the chance to blossom and grow in his own particular soil. He simply could not have achieved everything that he has done, nor glean such obvious pleasure from life without the security of the stable, loving environment his parents have provided for him. The toll it has taken upon them will have been great. They have scarcely referred to it. They clearly perceive W as a great gift in their lives and it is not difficult to see why. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Applying this evidential matrix to the applicable legal framework requires me to ask the initial question as to whether the threshold criteria is met on the available evidence. The starting point, see para 11 above, requires me to consider whether it is &#8220;obvious&#8221;, per Cobb J, that they are not met. Ms Cavanagh is charged on this point with being hoisted by her own petard. In a joint written submission for an earlier hearing, in April of this year, the parents&#8217; team stated the following: </p>

The key to that conclusion is in the attributability condition, as your lordship foreshadowed in your judgement of October 2021.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That is not merely inconvenient for the parent&#8217;s argument, if maintained, it must lead it to wilt and wither away. Ms Cavanagh has, with considerable forensic dexterity, tried to retreat from the apparent absolutism of the concession in order to negotiate herself into the Court&#8217;s discretionary territory. Even so, it remains her case that the threshold criteria are not met but should nonetheless be regarded as requiring to be put to forensic assay. She is essentially seeking a hook upon which to hang the HRA application in the hope that will achieve a stronger and better supported care plan. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;[19] It is important to emphasise that the provision &#8220;not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give&#8221; is not to be regarded as an abstract or hypothetical test but must be evaluated by reference to the circumstances the parent is confronting i.e. what would it be reasonable to expect of a parent in these particular circumstances, recognising that in a challenging situation many of us may behave in a way which might not objectively be viewed as reasonable. The test is not to be construed in a vacuum nor applied judgementally by reference to some gold standard of parenting which few (if any) could achieve. On the contrary, it contemplates a range of behaviour, incorporating inevitable human frailty. The reasonableness of the care given requires to be evaluated strictly by reference to the particular circumstances and the individual child.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Hellin did not attribute &#8216;blame&#8217; to the parents. She analysed harm, or the likelihood of it, as generated by the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;high stakes, high pressure, dynamic context&#8221;</span> in which the parents and the professionals were <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;trying to do their best&#8221;. </span>As is clear from the earlier judgment, I found that analysis to be compelling, tightly reasoned, and insightful. Every person involved in this case agrees with it. In those circumstances, it strikes me as axiomatic or to put it another way, &#8220;obvious&#8221;, that the threshold criteria are not met. Thus, the proceedings and the HRA claim fall away. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to note, that I have arrived at this conclusion not on the basis of the expert opinion but on my wider analysis of the evidential canvas. In particular, as I have stressed above, the evidence of the mother and the key social worker is integral to the wider evidence. A care order, be it an interim or final order, represents a significant intrusion into the life of the child and the parents. &#8216;Parental responsibility&#8217; manifestly confers rights and responsibilities to the parents. What must never be overlooked however, is that those rights also confer rights on the child. It is fundamentally in W&#8217;s interests that his parents should be entitled to take decisions for him unfettered by the intervention of the State. Corporate parenting will never be a complete substitute for a real parent. Where a real parent is available and able to meet a child&#8217;s needs, the child&#8217;s own rights are engaged. Care orders impose checks, reviews, visits, and assessments which are an intrusion into the child&#8217;s life as well and must be justified by the evidence. Here, they are not. W has the great fortune, not vouched safe to all children, of a secure, loving home. He does not require to be subject to public law intervention nor should he be. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the past, as Dr Hellin pointed out, the legal process has been a positive advantage to both parents and professionals. Now that the systemic intervention has commenced, the pendulum has swung, and litigation is more likely to prove an obstacle to progress. As the family courts often hear, constructive therapeutic intervention is far harder to achieve in the context of ongoing litigation. Much has been accomplished here and the obligation on all involved is to ensure that is built upon for the future. The extent of the care required must be focused on the needs of these particular parents and evaluated against the background of the case if it is to meet the needs of W. </p>
