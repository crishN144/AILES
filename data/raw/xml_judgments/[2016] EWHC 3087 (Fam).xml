	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The circumstances in which these proceedings came to be brought derive from evidence collated by the police, specifically the North East Counter-Terrorism Unit (&#8220;NECTU&#8221;), in their investigation into the lives of the parents; NECTU was properly given notice of these proceedings, and has been present and represented at most of the hearings which I have conducted.  At early case management hearings, directions were given for the disclosure of evidence gathered by NECTU in the course of its enquiries; issues of disclosure are discussed below (see [33]/[70]/[128]).  At an earlier hearing in October 2015 the Local Authority made an informal direct application for disclosure to NECTU; this was not an application which was directed through the court.  This provoked a request on the part of NECTU that I should conduct a Public Interest Immunity hearing in private.   I deal with this later, below (see [128]).  For reasons which will become apparent (see particularly [127] below), there has also been direct communication between the Court and the Ministry of Justice (&#8220;MoJ&#8221;) Government Legal in relation to the provision and funding of electronic tags.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The proceedings have been listed to be heard in two parts.  This judgment sets out my findings at the conclusion of the first, fact-finding, part, as the prelude to a determination of welfare issues, listed for 18 April.  As time is limited before that hearing, there has been no latitude to reserve this judgment.  Since delivering this judgment, I have anonymised this judgment extensively so that it does not reveal details which could lead to the identification of the family.  [This judgment has been published following the welfare hearing; the judgment following the welfare hearing is reported as <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/3088" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 3088 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 3088 (Fam)</ref>, and should be read with this].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, I am satisfied that all three children found separation from their parents in July 2015, for which they were wholly unprepared, &#8220;frightening&#8221; (as they themselves described it).  Following their reception into care, they had limited contact with their parents in the first week, which undoubtedly would have added to their upset, and they then hankered to return home.  They give an impression of being attached to their mother and father.  The social worker reports:</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.02in">&#8220;It is clear from the formal assessment sessions and from observations made in the contact sessions that both parents love the children and care for their well-being.  They have expressed a great deal of concern about their separation from the children and the impact the separation is having on the children&#8221;.</p>

	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.02in;text-indent:-0.5in">I further note the social worker&#8217;s comment that:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.02in">&#8220;the sibling relationship is extremely strong; [E] often seeks comfort from [D]&#8221; (&#167;39).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.04in">The Guardian, through Ms Garnham in her closing submissions, advised the court that in her view, &#8220;the parents are loving and capable parents who are articulate and knowledgeable&#8230; the children have experienced many aspects of positive parenting.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, in my judgment, both C and D presented well in the police/social work interviews to which I have listened (in full) and watched (in part); they appear relatively mature for their ages, were well-mannered, articulate and co-operative.  The mother described D as &#8216;confident&#8217;, and although softly spoken, I agree with this assessment; D in particular displayed engaging charm and a good sense of humour, notwithstanding the stress of the occasion and her undoubted emotional turmoil.</p>

I felt he was aroused by the attention which his expressions of radical ideology brought him, but to some extent at least, was claiming that he recognised that he had gone too far.</p>

The mother told me (surprisingly) that when it came to it, &#8220;there was not much discussion&#8221; between the parents before the decision was taken that they would go (XX LA), and &#8220;it was all planned really quickly&#8221;.  The father gave an essentially unpersuasive explanation (from the witness box) for the particular timing of the trip which depends upon my acceptance of an account of C experiencing some harassment at school, and the need to give him a break, a holiday, some form of distraction. I do not accept that explanation, largely because of its inherently unconvincing character, but in any event confirmed by C&#8217;s own denial to the Children&#8217;s Guardian only shortly after the events of any bullying at school.  It is surprising that the parents decided to make the visit one week before the end of term, all the more so given that the mother harboured a hope that the family might be able to &#8220;extend [the trip] for a day or two&#8221;, which would not of course have been feasible if their account of the children being back in school on Monday were to be accepted.  </p>

In summary, this trip would leave them only one clear day (Saturday) for their activities (see plans [61] below). </p>

The timing of the trip in my finding had more to do with the father&#8217;s admitted awareness that the family were under police surveillance (see [16] above); his discomfort at that was exacerbated by the recent visits of both police and social services to their home.  In view of his social media postings, revealing (on his own admission) extremist views (which I discuss below), and against the background of his previous arrest, it seems more likely that the family left when they did in order to avoid what they saw as increasingly unwelcome interest by the State in their lives.  </p>

One was described as thick, black woolly with two patches cut out for the eyes. It was in fact the other which was found in the car (covering nose and mouth, but with a single aperture for the eyes).

Although no route was marked out on the maps (and Hungary is missing) cartographical continuity is to a large extent achieved (so the Local Authority maintains) between mid-Europe and areas controlled by ISIS (Syria/Iraq).  There were as it happens also some 3 or 4 maps of Portugal.  The police and Local Authority assert that when fitted together, the maps provide a clear forensic indicator of the parents intended ultimate destination. These maps had obviously only recently been viewed, they say, as the Acer laptop was itself a recent purchase (the box and receipt were still in the home). Furthermore, it transpires that on the day before travel (8 July), web &#8216;apps&#8217; or software programmes had been loaded up onto the Samsung (2) mobile phone (including TomTom) which would have provided satellite navigation.  </p>

He invites me to view the social media interactions in this case through this lens. To some extent he may be right. But of course it may be that in the privacy of one&#8217;s own home, and under the relative anonymity of a pseudonym, with time to construct the message, people feel freer to articulate their genuine views, forge links, and stimulate relationships. The dangers are obvious &#8211; social media is an extraordinarily public environment, messages travel the globe in seconds; the influence of chatterers spreads quickly and widely.  </p>

This was not a family weekend away.  I do not rule out that the family would indeed have visited north west Germany; but that was in my judgment almost certainly not their ultimate destination.  While attempts may have been made to locate and visit the family relatives, this was not the primary purpose of the trip.  Individual features of their account are inherently unreliable; I have made findings on these already.  When the evidence is looked at as a whole, their story is, in my view, a nonsense.</p>

In my judgment, they fraudulently tried to obtain credit from store and bank cards, and equally fraudulently further placed items for sale on e-Bay which they did not own in order to raise cash, &amp;/or goods.  Having received money from innocent purchasers for items sold on e-Bay into their accounts, they converted it hurriedly into cash.  The loan from the maternal grandfather was not, I find, for the purchase of a car (the parents already had two); it was to boost the cash fund on which the family were going to live.</p>

There was a crescendo in the parents&#8217; interest in sharing views on social media of an extremist nature; they posted messages which I am satisfied indicated their own support for terrorist activities, individual known terrorists and terrorist organisations; they clearly adopted, openly supported and repeated the views of others who proclaimed similarly radical views.  Both parents contributed to the social media conversations by posting in ever-more graphic ways comments, images, and video clips, which had an obviously extremist content, many supporting the activities of ISIS.  </p>

I have had no difficulty in rejecting all of these possible constructs on the particular evidence which I have outlined above.   Furthermore, although I have considered the evidence of each parent separately, there is no real reason to distinguish between the actions and/or stated beliefs of the father and those of the mother in this regard.  Quite apart from the fact that both parents have independently posted messages in extreme terms, they appear (by &#8216;following&#8217; each other) to have some knowledge of (and implicitly condoned) the actions of the other.</p>

Much of what I have read is infected with thoughts involving the possibility of "terrorism" or, indeed, hatred for their native country, which is England, or another religion, such as Christianity (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span> above).

There are some small indicators in the evidence which pointed to an indifference on the part of the parents to the risk of the children being exposed to harm, or involved the children in activities which could lead to harm: there is uncontroverted evidence that the father encouraged D in the chanting of the message about the army of Usamah. It is said by the Local Authority that it echoes a call to join the jihadi fight against the unbelievers which was made by WG1; while not accepting the Local Authority&#8217;s construction of the &#8216;chant&#8217; (about which I make no specific finding) the father accepted in evidence that it was wrong to have involved D in this sort of activity.  As mentioned above, I found a worrying connotation between D as the &#8216;lioness&#8217;, and WG6 &#8211; a terrorist &#8211; as a &#8216;lion&#8217; (see [82(ii)/83]).

A more sophisticated system of GPS monitoring is also available, which is programmed to track the tagged person's movements at defined intervals (if desired, a period measured in minutes or even parts of minutes) and programmed to send an automatic report to the monitoring control of those movements at pre-determined intervals (which, again, can be a matter of minutes rather than hours). It also alerts the monitoring control if the tagged person either interferes with the tag or travels outside a previously defined zone. The equipment is designed to 'fail safe', so it may occasionally send a false report that someone has absconded or interfered with the equipment when in fact neither has happened.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In applying those principles in a case such as this, which involves investigations by the Counter-Terrorism unit, it is evident that the fundamental right of the parents, the children and the local authority to a fair trial had to be balanced against the public interest in maintaining national security. In the event there was no specific evidence on which I had to rule on admissibility, though recognised that the specific submissions made by Mr Skelt could not be shared with the parties even if that would have been their ordinary expectation under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 6</span>.  There is an important distinction between the right to a fair hearing (which is absolute) and the right to minimum disclosure of relevant information (which is not). On the particular facts of that case, the disadvantage to the parents of withholding some information about the collation of material was outweighed by the paramount need to protect the integrity of the security services processes (see <span style="font-style:italic">Kiani v The Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/776" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 776" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 776</ref>).  </p>
