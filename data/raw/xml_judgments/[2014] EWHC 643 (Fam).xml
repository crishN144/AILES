The father has lived in England all his life. Until the marriage the mother had spent her life living with her family in India. After the marriage the mother took up residence with her parents-in-law in India whilst the father returned to England. A short while later the mother came to England. She and the father lived at an address in Birmingham which they shared with other members of the father&#8217;s family.</p>

That hearing was conducted by His Honour Judge Brown in May 2012. Whilst all domestic abuse is serious, the findings made fall at the lower end of the spectrum of abuse. The judge&#8217;s findings included findings that one of the father&#8217;s sisters, G, was controlling, that she had intimidated, belittled and bullied the mother, that she had manhandled the mother, that during her third pregnancy G had pushed her, that LR had been overly chastised by the father, his mother and by G and that the father had also chastised TR. </p>

Handover takes place outside a police station close to the mother&#8217;s home. If this gives the impression that there is increasing trust and co-operation between these parents, that is a false impression. There remains a complete lack of trust. The progression of contact has been court led. There have been steps backward as well as steps forward. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.71in">India is not a signatory to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The 1980 Hague Convention exists to allow children who have been abducted or wrongfully retained by a parent to be returned to the country where they normally live so that matters of residence and contact can be decided by the courts in that jurisdiction. In cases where a child has been removed from the UK to a country such as India, without such a mechanism in place, a left behind parent will usually have to go through lengthy and costly legal proceedings in the hope of getting their child/children returned to the UK.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.71in">The Child Abduction Section also sees many &#8216;child retention&#8217; cases in countries without an effective mechanism in place to return children. These are cases in which a child is taken out of the jurisdiction of the UK for a temporary period of time, the dates of this period often incorporated in to a UK court order. The courts in India are under no obligation to uphold a UK court order, just as there is no obligation for the UK courts to uphold any court orders from foreign jurisdictions. With this in mind, a left behind parent would have to employ a legal representative in India to initiate legal proceedings, which can be both costly and distressing.&#8217;</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.63in">&#8216;23. The overriding consideration for the Court in deciding whether to allow a parent to take a child to a non-Hague Convention country is whether the making of that order would be in the best interests of the child. Where (as in most cases) there is some risk of abduction and an obvious detriment to the child if that risk were to materialise, the Court has to be positively satisfied that the advantages to the child of her visiting that country outweigh the risks to her welfare which the visit will entail. This will therefore routinely involve the Court in investigating what safeguards can be put in place to minimise the risk of retention and to secure the child's return if that transpires. Those safeguards should be capable of having a real and tangible effect in the jurisdiction in which they are to operate and be capable of being easily accessed by the UK-based parent. Although, in common with Black LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re </span>M, we do not say that no application of this category can proceed in the absence of expert evidence, we consider that there is a need in most cases for the effectiveness of any suggested safeguard to be established by competent and complete expert evidence which deals specifically and in detail with that issue. If in doubt the Court should err on the side of caution and refuse to make the order. If the judge decides to proceed in the absence of expert evidence, then very clear reasons are required to justify such a course.&#8217;</p>

I was invited to reconsider my order.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.63in">&#8216;28. Before leaving this case we wish to draw attention to a real difficulty that seems likely to be a feature of future cases where application is made to remove a child temporarily to a non-Hague Convention state. We have already restated the importance of the court having access to clear and reliable expert evidence before being in a position to determine the application. Both parties in the present case are legally aided but counsel have confirmed that, following recent changes to the provision of Legal Aid, public funding will no longer be available to parents in these applications (save where there has been domestic violence). The question of how the necessary expert opinion is to be paid for is therefore likely to be a real issue in a significant number of cases. We see this as an additional difficulty facing judges and the adult parties (who may well themselves be litigants in person). The questions of how and to whom particular cases are allocated to individual judges are a matter for the President of the Family Division. Our present purpose is not to trespass upon the President's responsibility but simply to flag up this new potential complication for cases which are already at the most difficult end of the spectrum. In doing so we would simply wish to repeat Thorpe LJ's exhortation for these cases ordinarily to be dealt with by the judges of the Division.&#8217;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in">Before I review the evidence it is appropriate to remind myself of the law to be applied in determining these applications. With respect to each of the issues I am asked to determine, the starting point is <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. The children&#8217;s welfare must be my paramount consideration. In determining what is in the children&#8217;s best welfare interests I must have regard to each of the factors set out in the welfare checklist in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(3)</ref>.

I have been referred to four authorities. Two of them, both first instance decisions (<span style="font-style:italic">Re A (Security for return to jurisdiction)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 FLR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 FLR 1</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Leave to remove from the jurisdiction: securing return from holiday)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 507" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 507</ref>) are examples of safeguards put in place in those cases in order to try to ensure that children were returned to the UK at the end of a holiday to a non-Convention country. They do not set out any points of principle. The principles are to be found in two decisions of the Court of Appeal, <span style="font-style:italic">Re R (A child)</span>, to which I referred earlier, and <span style="font-style:italic">Re K (Removal from jurisdiction: Practice)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 FLR 1084" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 FLR 1084</ref>.

On this issue I have been reminded of the observation made by Mr Justice Charles in <span style="font-style:italic">A County Council v K, D and L </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 851" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 851</ref> that</p>

As appears therefrom, a conclusion that a person is lying or telling the truth about point A does not mean that he is lying or telling the truth about point B. Also I accept that there can be many reasons why a person might not tell the truth to a court concerned with the future upbringing of a child. Further, I of course recognise that witnesses can believe that their evidence contains a correct account of relevant events, but be mistaken because, for example, they misinterpreted the relevant events at the time or because they have over time convinced themselves of the account they now give.&#8217;</p>

He has produced an extract from the FCO website headed &#8216;Child Abduction &#8211; India&#8217;.

For the mother, Mr Tyler seeks to persuade me that the father&#8217;s objections to this holiday are rooted in his ongoing desire to control and belittle the mother. I do not accept that submission. Notwithstanding the findings made by Judge Brown, I am satisfied that so far as this holiday is concerned the father&#8217;s fears are genuine. He does not trust the mother to return the children to England. He is concerned that she is very close to her father and open to persuasion by him not to return the children to England. He is also concerned that his own research suggests that if the children were wrongfully retained in India, securing their return to England would be a lengthy, costly and uncertain process the difficulties of which would be compounded were the mother to invoke Section 498A.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in">Having made that point, I turn to consider the three elements set out by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re R (A Child).</span> Firstly, I must consider the magnitude of the risk of breach of the order if permission is given. For the father, Mr Verdan concedes that the risk is low. I accept that that is so. However, it is important to make the point that &#8216;low&#8217; does not equate with &#8216;non-existent&#8217;. There is a risk in this case which, though low, is nonetheless real. I accept that the mother appears to be intent on making a new life for herself with HB in London, though I am concerned that so little is known about him, not least about his immigration status. I accept that the mother wants her children to know about their wider family and culture, though I am concerned that she is very close to her father and susceptible to persuasion by him. The risk of wrongful retention is low but is nonetheless a risk which cannot be ignored.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in">Secondly I must consider the magnitude of the consequence of breach if it occurs. It is on this issue that Mr Tyler concedes he is in the greatest difficulty. There is very clear evidence from the guardian, which I accept, that all four of these children have a close and loving relationship with both of their parents. They are equally comfortable in either home. They are settled in school. Although they may have a curiosity about their wider family and about life in India, they were born in England, they have spent their entire lives living in England, their social relationships are all in England. They are habitually resident in England. Although Mr Tyler eschewed the use of the word &#8216;catastrophic&#8217; to describe the consequences for the children were they not to be returned to England following the proposed trip to India, he accepts that the consequences for them would be profound. They would be life-changing. They would not be life-enhancing. Wrongful retention would have a profoundly damaging impact on their relationship with their father and wider paternal family. The damage could not adequately be compensated for by use of modern technology such as Skype. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in">Thirdly, I must have regard to the level of security that may be achieved by building in to the arrangements all of the available safeguards. What are the safeguards that could be built in? Mr Tyler does not advocate any particular safeguards. Rather, he points to the various safeguarding measures adopted by Wall J (as he then was) and Hogg J in the first instance decisions in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (Security for return to jurisdiction)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 FLR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 FLR 1</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Leave to remove from the jurisdiction: securing return from holiday)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 507" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 507</ref> and effectively says to the court, &#8216;take your pick&#8217;. That is simply not good enough. It is the responsibility of an applicant wishing temporarily to remove her children from the jurisdiction to set out precisely the safeguarding measures being proposed together with a reasoned analysis of why the court should accept that those proposed safeguards are (a) the best that can be achieved and (b) likely to be effective. It is in this area in particular that the court would have been assisted by expert evidence.</p>

In this case the evidence from the FCO makes it clear that the task of recovering the children were they to be wrongfully retained would likely be lengthy, complex, costly and uncertain. To that mix must be added the father&#8217;s concern (and in the absence of expert evidence, the uncertainty) about the consequences were the mother to invoke Section 498A.</p>

However, given that the father has to travel from Birmingham to Leicester to return the children I am of the opinion that a small extension should be allowed.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in">In a case such as this, where expert evidence is considered by the court to be necessary, the question arises &#8216;who will pay for it?&#8217; Where the party or parties who must pay for it are publicly funded the solicitors for those parties have a choice. Either they may instruct the proposed expert, incur responsibility for paying his fee and trust that they will be reimbursed at the end of the case as a result of the fee being approved by the person assessing their bill of costs or, alternatively, the solicitor may apply to the LAA for prior authority to incur that disbursement. Not surprisingly, in my experience it is almost always the case that a solicitor is unwilling to take the risk of not being reimbursed the costs paid to the expert and therefore insists on obtaining prior authority. In my judgment that approach is entirely reasonable. No solicitor acting for a publicly funded party should be expected to take the risk of being out of pocket by instructing an expert without prior authority from the LAA.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in">As a result of my order of 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July giving leave to instruct an expert in Indian law and limiting his fees to &#163;2,500 plus VAT, the mother&#8217;s solicitor sent the LAA an application for prior authority in LAA Form APP8. Form APP8, be it noted, is a lengthy (11 page) complex form which needs to be completed with care. Failure to complete it properly is almost certain to lead to the application being refused. Completion of this form is, of itself, a time consuming task.</p>

The letter is clearly a standard letter. It sets out five reasons for refusal. In summary, these are, (i) the estimate of the expert&#8217;s fees is excessive, (ii) no alternative quotes have been obtained, (iii) there is insufficient breakdown of the costs to be incurred, (iv) the expert&#8217;s costs should be borne by or shared with the other party, (v) the application does not appear to fall within the regulations. The letter ends by saying, &#8216;since the introduction of the 2010 Standard Civil contract and the 2012 Family Contract there is no right of appeal&#8217;.</p>

She ordered that the expert&#8217;s costs should be borne by the mother and the children&#8217;s guardian, and explained why <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/22/section/22/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.22(4)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/22" uk:canonical="1999 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Access to Justice Act 1999</ref> did not apply. She also had a telephone conversation and an e-mail exchange with Michael Rimer, Head of Litigation Team and Senior Legal Adviser with the LAA. Mr Rimer is the agreed point of contact between the judiciary and the LAA in cases where there are funding difficulties. If that dialogue led to quiet confidence that progress could be made, that confidence was misplaced.</p>

I am unclear how you consider the reasonable private paying client test to be met, and so it may help if when you submit your new estimate to the High Cost team, you address these points.&#8217;</p>

Further to this, the amount of time sought for research is surprising considering the expert to be instructed is an expert in this area, i.e. Indian case-law, hence the reasoning behind the instruction. We would expect to see this reduced significantly prior to an agreement being reached.&#8217;</p>

Although I have not been given details of the time spent by the solicitors in pursuing this issue with the LAA, it seems to me to be self-evident that it must have been considerable. This process is wasteful and inefficient. Solicitors are being required to deal with a level of bureaucracy that is almost impenetrable. They are also being required to deal with the consequences that flow from decisions that are unappealable including explaining to their clients why they cannot have the expert evidence which the court has directed is necessary. This is unsatisfactory.</p>
