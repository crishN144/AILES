Care proceedings in respect of E were initiated due to his mother&#8217;s reluctance to accept assistance offered by the Local Authority to help with E&#8217;s medical condition.  E has a diagnosis of severe obstructive sleep apnoea, and this has a significant impact on his general health and development.  Other issues surrounded the mother&#8217;s ability to manage his condition and engage with medical professionals involved in treating E, but also her ability to meet the needs of the other children given the impact of his care needs and her own mental health, neglect of the children, domestic violence between the mother and the father and illicit drug use by each of them.</span></p>

The matter that I still have some hesitancy, if I can put it like that, at the moment, is the issue of the psychological report because as has now been confirmed, it was only previously on Mother, only that now is going to be, that is going to extend to all the children, for example; I am not sure if that was the suggestion or whether it only extends, for example, to C.  I think that needs to be effectively honed in and maybe determined on Wednesday so I am not making a determination in respect of that but that is something I think does need to form the basis of discussions obviously between now and Wednesday to determine that.</span></p>

In so doing, the learned District Judge adopted a &#8216;start again&#8217; approach regarding the assessment process of the mother.  It was argued that the PAMS assessment being out of date would be relevant only if there was not sufficient up-to-date evidence of the mother&#8217;s parenting capacity.  However, it was argued that here there is; three of the children had been moved back into the mother&#8217;s care and as a result, the Local Authority had had an opportunity to observe and assess the mother&#8217;s ability to parent, on the ground, rather than through the artificial environment of an assessment adopting the PAMS model.

The purpose of a PAMS assessment is to assess whether a parent with cognitive difficulties can complete certain care tasks and parenting.  It is parenting in the abstract.  One could appreciate that there might be unfairness to the mother if there had been a negative PAMS assessment with a conclusion that targeted work needed to be carried out with the mother with reassessment after that work was done.  However here, the mother was assessed positively.  In that sense the mother can pass the PAMS assessment in the abstract.

There was no evidence to suggest that the report was necessary.  There was no evidence to suggest that her behaviour was due to psychiatric or psychological condition, rather than her lived experiences, therefore it should have been dismissed and not adjourned.  Further application could have been made if necessary.  By leaving it adjourned without setting a date for decision, it exposed the proceedings to the potential of being derailed.  There was an appointment for C with the Child and Adolescent Mental Services in March, but that was believed to be just a triage appointment and therefore there could be some significant delay before one arrived at any final decision on diagnosis, if indeed there was any psychiatric or psychological condition to diagnose rather than just learned behaviour.</span></p>

This was because they were going to ask the Court to consider alternative options for permanence which included removal of the children in the mother&#8217;s care and not rehabilitating the children to the mother with potentially adoption for the three younger children.  That represented a fundamental change to the final care plans already before the Court through rehabilitation.  The Local Authority would need to update its final evidence in order that definitive plans and the requisite Re B-S analysis could be provided and properly and carefully scrutinised by the Agency Decision Maker or the Court.  Therefore, they supported the mother&#8217;s application for further independent social worker assessment.  To proceed to final hearing on 23 January would have enabled the Court to consider only the options of foster care and rehabilitation home, and there was insufficient evidence to evaluate the option of adoption which was now a realistic option.</span></p>

Case management decisions of this sort are particularly hard to appeal and in this case, it cannot be said that the judge overlooked any considerations which were material. An assessment such as a local authority&#8217;s parenting assessment of the father can be challenged in ways other than obtaining a competing assessment. If the facts upon which the assessment has proceeded are wrong, they can be disputed. If the opinions are flawed, that can be explored in cross-examination, the author of the report being taken to the material which undermines or contradicts the conclusions he or she has drawn. Or, as the Guardian contemplated here, a party can take steps to address the problems that have been identified and/or that he or she acknowledges.&#8221;</span></p>

They have declined to be assessed for the full viability assessment therefore ruling them out of gaining an order such as special guardianship.  The Local Authority would prefer for D to remain with his Grandparents and this would be considered under a child arrangements order.  This, however, would be on the basis that the Grandparents would be able to commit to caring for D long term.  If this could not happen then the plan of foster care would be proposed for D.  </span></p>

It would seem, that according to the Local Authority reports, that her willingness to engage in therapy has been fairly recent and the CGL report of 19 January 2023 shows that her engagement with them has been poor in terms of group work, although she has turned up for one-to-one appointments and answered phone calls.  </span></p>

That is an issue that needs to be grappled with immediately.  In my judgment the application should be dismissed.  C is now under the auspices of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services; they will be able to provide guidance to the Local Authority as it arises to build into its care plan; of course, it may come to nothing if there is no psychological or psychiatric condition.  </span></p>
