The Local Authority has been represented by Mr Hall of Counsel; S has been represented by Ms McKie of Counsel, by direct instruction from S; and S&#8217;s mother is here in court with S&#8217;s maternal grandmother.  S also has a Children&#8217;s Guardian, who has taken something of a back seat, in view of the representation which S has managed to achieve for herself directly.

When in the care of her natural mother before that, she had had a very turbulent time.  Those early formative years have, unhappily, left their mark on her.  Her (adopted) parents separated five years or more ago, and it may be that S has missed the boundaries that may have been set and enforced more by her father than by her mother, doing her best as a single mother.  Be that as it may, her relationship with her mother, I mean her adoptive mother, has been a very difficult one and S has on occasions been arrested for physical assaults on her.  </span></p>

The home and the other residents had to be put on &#8220;lock down&#8221; for their safety.  She barricaded herself in her room, smashed a mirror and attempted to cut her arms, threatening to kill herself.  As a result, the police were re-called and she was taken to the local police station.  There she removed her clothes and attempted to use them to strangle herself, and was cutting her arms with a plastic knife.  Later the same day, she showed staff at the home bruising on her hip and a mark on her breast which she said was a bite mark.  She said it had been done by someone when she was &#8220;working&#8221;.

S, too, has addressed me herself from some notes which she wrote out in her own handwriting before coming into court.  I have had photocopies made of them for the file and have read them again in my room.  The note demonstrates the beginning of insight by S into her anti-social, self-damaging and totally unacceptable behaviours as outlined in the documents.  It demonstrates some insight into the risks and dangers which she has put herself in of the type which I have sought briefly to summarise.  S essentially makes the point that she has been much affected by her experience of the last few days in the H secure unit and now intends to turn her life around.  But she says that she would do this better if she were trusted to do it </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">not</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> in secure accommodation, but in circumstances where she would be free to come and go, with much less control over her.

She, S&#8217;s mother, really wants someone to take this particular decision for her.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian, in a brief comment, said that in effect that she thought that S should make a virtue out of a period of calm and should determine to move on in her life as and when the secure order came to an end.  </span></p>

As I read <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 25</ref> and there has been very little time to look into this, S is a child who is looked after by this Local Authority, a &#8216;child&#8217; being a person who is under 18.  S is under 18.  She is being looked after by the Local Authority, under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 20(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, as being a child in need, who has reached the age of 16 and whose welfare the authority consider is likely to be seriously prejudiced, if they do no provide her with accommodation.  This seems to me at first blush to cover S and to put her within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 25</ref>.</span></p>

These good points come out clearly on occasions.  It is reported that she has warmth; a good sense of humour; a good level of intelligence and much academic ability.  She gave a very good account of herself when speaking to me this afternoon.  Indeed, it is difficult to take on board the fact that the young woman, quite self-possessed, well-presented and seemingly confident this afternoon, is the same young woman who can behave in the many dysfunctional and risky ways of which I have read.  She needs real time, in my judgment, for things to calm down in her life.  She needs to undergo the psychological/psychiatric assessment which the Local Authority expect to be able to offer her within approximately 14 days.  She really can see this hearing as a turning point and a force for good if she has a mind to.  I urge her to do so.</span></p>

If the application is properly under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 25</ref>, I have </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">a duty</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> to make the order; but if I am in the realms of a &#8216;best interests&#8217; decision, then I must exercise a discretion under the Inherent Jurisdiction.

I propose to make the order for one month.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">I very much hope, S, if I can address you personally, that you will realise what I said to you before lunch, which is that everyone in this court wants what is best for you.  You can do it, if you want to.  If you can turn yourself around outside of secure accommodation (as you say you can) then you can do it in a short period of secure accommodation; if you want to.  If you do disengage and if you are difficult, you will be the person who suffers most from it.  I believe that you can make this a turning-point and that you will benefit from the professional help and the psychiatric and psychological input from an assessment, which you should be getting.  But, at the end of the day, it is your life: courts and professionals can only do so much.  I do not doubt, when you say you want to make the change yourself today (without going into secure accommodation) that you mean it.  But your life has been very volatile in the past, as can be seen from reading the case histories.  If you were permitted to be in non-secure accommodation as early as today, and if you went out into the community with your partner and you were not able to stick to your word, then neither you, nor your mother, nor anyone with your interests at heart, would end up thanking me for what I had decided this afternoon.  </span></p>
