The Central Authorities are bound by the obligations of co-operation which are set forth in Article 7 to promote the peaceful enjoyment of access rights and the fulfilment of any conditions to which the exercise of those rights may be subject. The Central Authorities shall take steps to remove, as far as possible, all obstacles to the exercise of such rights.  </p>

But whereas F proposes that contact should take place immediately in Japan, M&#8217;s position is that it should take place initially in England before it can, in time and subject to Z&#8217;s wishes, progress to Japan. A third option, contact in France, was raised by the Family Court Adviser. </p>

That was more a reflection of their personalities than the nature or quality of their evidence. What shone through was their mutual antipathy and lack of trust. Each displayed suspicions of the other&#8217;s motives. While I am quite sure that they each want the very best for their son, they have different views as to how that should be achieved, and whether the other is truly child focused. </p>

F disputes her account, but it seems to me that M&#8217;s presentation is likely to be accurate, not least because the order of 2 May 2018 records at Recital 3: &#8220;AND UPON the respondent husband having notified the applicant wife through solicitors on 27 April 2018 that he had left the jurisdiction of England and Wales in favour of Japan, and further that he had (i) severed the tenancy on the family home on 1 April 2018, (ii) terminated his employment at Mitsubishi and (iii) as a consequence of the termination of employment had lost his UK immigration status and the agreement of his employers to pay school fees for Z&#8221;.

The court order records that he had solicitors on the record, but neither F nor his solicitors appeared. F says that he instructed his solicitors to attend at the MPS hearing, but that they failed to do so; this struck me as surprising and not wholly plausible. In any event, given his nonengagement he cannot complain about the orders which were made, presumably on the basis of evidence put in by M.  </p>

He has not applied to discharge the order. He told me that he cannot afford to engage with the proceedings but (i) he had his Japanese lawyer in attendance at this hearing, which indicates some ability to pay for representation and (ii) he could attend in person. He asserts that at the time of the maintenance pending suit hearing he had retired, and his retirement income is now &#163;18,000 pa. If that is correct, and unless he has significant liquid capital which can be accessed by him, he is in no position to meet the order. If what he says is right, his financial position is straightforward and the financial remedy proceedings should be capable of swift resolution.  I do not consider he has any justification for his nonparticipation. Worse, the fact that the financial issues have not been finally and definitively resolved is a running sore between the parties, which in turn affects Z. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Curiously, the Central Family Court has been content to allow the financial remedy proceedings to come to a virtual halt, with no progress to final resolution. The FDR hearing date has been adjourned approximately every 6 months with no directions given.  There has therefore been no substantive hearing of any sort since 2 May 2018. There has been no disclosure, negotiation, or participation. Nor has W progressed her divorce suit, such that an uncontested petition issued 3 years ago has not yet led to pronouncement of decree nisi; it appears that the cause is the lack of the Japanese &#8220;Certificate of Acceptance&#8221; in relation to the marriage. This is a wholly unsatisfactory state of affairs.   </p>

This was a suspicion formed on the basis of things told to him by Z which demonstrates all too clearly how a child can so easily be drawn into a parental dispute, inappropriately and contrary to his interests.

This will therefore routinely involve the court in investigating what safeguards can be put in place to minimise the risk of retention and to secure the child's return if that transpires. Those safeguards should be capable of having a real and tangible effect in the jurisdiction in which they are to operate and be capable of being easily accessed by the UK-based parent. Although, in common with Black LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M </span>we do not say that no application in this category can proceed in the absence of expert evidence, we consider that there is a need in most cases for the effectiveness of any suggested safeguard to be established by competent and complete expert evidence which deals specifically and in detail with that issue. If in doubt the Court should err on the side of caution and refuse to make the order. If the judge decides to proceed in the absence of expert evidence, then very clear reasons are required to justify such a course.&#8221; </p>

The magnitude of risk of breach of the order is reduced because of the availability of the Hague Convention procedure, which should ensure a swift return. The magnitude of the consequence of the breach will be reduced by the ability to apply for, and obtain, a prompt return. And available safeguards may be less necessary because of the applicability of the Convention.  </p>

In my view there is some force in the suggestion that M negatively influences Z against his father, but I am also of the view that she is not aware of the extent of her views bearing upon Z. Further, I accept Ms Stokes&#8217; evidence that Z&#8217;s outlook may in part be the product of his mother&#8217;s views, but are also undoubtedly his own as well.  </p>

I would not consider it right to force him to go to Japan, against his will, if other options are available.

If the issue is forced now, I consider that her antipathy to F will increase, and those feelings will undoubtedly be accentuated in Z&#8217;s eyes.  The impact on M would thereby be damaging for Z. </p>

In this country, although 6 weeks is the mandated timescale for determination of a return order, in reality it can take months.  Should that be the case in Japan, the consequences for Z of being separated from his primary carer for a substantial period would be highly damaging.  I would need to be satisfied on the basis of evidence from a Single Joint Expert as to how this would work in practice but there is no such evidence before me. </p>

I also bear in mind his stance in the Japanese proceedings where he raised a wish for Z to live with him.

It is open to either party to apply in the future, at which time consideration will have to be given to Z&#8217;s views and the need for expert evidence.  Better by far would be the parties, in conjunction with Z, reaching an agreed way forward and for that additional reason it seems to me appropriate to put the onus on them to progress contact rather than bring the matter automatically back before a judge.  </p>

But the plain fact is that he cannot have it both ways. He cannot refuse to engage, and breach court orders, and in the same breath use that as justification for contact to take place only in Japan.  In my judgment, he should apply to discharge the MPS order and engage in the financial proceedings.  In any event, it may be that enforcement proceedings would be nugatory if he can establish that his income is &#163;18,000pa and that the agreement in Japan supersedes the order here.  All of that must be a matter for him to address. I do not think it fair for him to ignore English orders and at the same time pray them in aid of his contact application.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Fortunately, there is another option, namely contact to take place in a third country such as France. Ms Stokes saw no particular difficulty with this, and I agree. Although contact in England would be preferable, contact in France should be pleasurable and successful for Z. It is appropriate for F to meet the travel and accommodation costs of both Z and M (but not M&#8217;s daily living costs). That will enable M to travel to France with Z, and stay there for the duration of contact if she so chooses, which should be added reassurance for him. It will need to be explained carefully to him.  M in her evidence seemed receptive to the idea, although final submissions on her behalf were steadfastly against the idea on the grounds of risk of abduction (but not against it on any other welfare grounds).  I regard the risk of abduction from France as considerably less than the risk of wrongful retention by F in Japan. Further, in my judgment, having considered all the evidence and submissions carefully, the risk of abduction can be mitigated by the conditions at paragraph 43 above, which shall be adapted to reflect the geographical location for contact as being in France. France is a signatory to the Hague Convention and, as BIIR applies because the application was issued before 11pm on 31 December 2020, an Article 39 certificate can be lodged in the French courts and/or such other step as enables registration of the order in France.  </p>
