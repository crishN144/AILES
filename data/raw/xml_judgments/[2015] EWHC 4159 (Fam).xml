	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">On Friday, 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> August this year, The Daily Mail newspaper published an updated online article.  The article was removed from The Mail Online shortly before 4pm on 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> August and, I have been told on behalf of the Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) that it would have been removed earlier had there not been &#8216;technical problems&#8217;.  Solicitors for the London Borough of Tower Hamlets had contacted ANL complaining that it was in breach of Orders made in the Family Division.  The previous day The Sun newspaper had published an article in hard copy, which, like the Mail Online article, identified a child subject to these proceedings.  The articles both identified a child as having been arrested in connection with terrorist offences. It was also reported that the child was a pupil at the Bethnal Green Academy.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The local authority took the view, that it would not require any great degree of ingenuity to make the association between the arrest and these proceedings.  Before turning to the substantive application before me I should like to make a few general observations which seem to me to give context.  As I have already explained in earlier judgments, concerns relating to the radicalisation of minors are a new facet of child protection.  Nonetheless, it is important that the professionals involved hold fast to tried and tested principles of comprehensive risk assessment and guard against the kind of moral panic that can all too quickly be generated by what are for many, not just the families involved, highly emotive issues.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The family justice system has, in recent years, taken great strides to ensure that its work becomes properly transparent to public scrutiny.  There is however, and will always be, a tension between that important objective and the equally important obligation to protect children subject to proceedings, within this Division and vulnerable adults in the Court of Protection.   Inevitably, this is a period of evolution.  To achieve the goal of putting important information within the public domain requires the Court consistently to focus on the importance of Article 10 Rights (Freedom of expression) as well as Article 8 Rights which it instinctively protects.  Similarly, and to achieve the same goals, the press must recognise that the protection of vulnerable children will always be given considerable weight in a mature, democratic society.  I have had on more than one occasion recently cause publicly to thank the press for its responsible approach to cases involving both vulnerable adults and children.  The tension between promoting a transparent family justice system and protecting vulnerable children is an essentially healthy one and will always require a careful parallel analysis of competing rights and interests.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">This case concerns the &#8216;radicalisation&#8217; of minors.  There will be both proceedings within the Family Division and a concurrent police investigation.  That is a familiar scenario in a wide range of cases.  Radicalisation however is an issue that the public is understandably anxious about and wherever possible, within the framework that I have just broadly outlined, openness should be the load star.  The Local Authority whose concern is to protect children is very concerned that any information relating to their identity and whereabouts may place them at considerable risk.  I accept that evaluating risk against the kind of identified harm contemplated here is unchartered territory.  It involves a combination of potentially physical as well as emotional harm.  Accordingly, the Local Authority has felt that protecting the privacy of these children in order to ensure their safety and general welfare must be the priority.  I am inclined to think that is the right course but I also consider that the journey of understanding these cases requires to be travelled in a way which promotes wider public understanding of these issues.   To inhibit proper public scrutiny of these cases may have unacceptable consequences.  An over cautious approach to the protection of children&#8217;s privacy may generate mistrust and suspicion.  It can, of course, also create a vacuum of information which can be exploited by those with a nefarious agenda.   </span></p>

Uncomfortable though it may frequently be for the defendant that is a normal consequence of his crime&#8230;From time to time occasions will arise where restrictions on this principle are considered appropriate, but they depend on express legislation, and, where the Court is vested with a discretion to exercise such powers, on the absolute necessity for doing so in the individual case."</span></p>

Equally, each Article qualifies the right it propounds so far as it may be lawful, necessary, and proportionate to do so in order to accommodate the other. The exercise to be performed is one of parallel analysis in which the starting point is presumptive parity, in that neither Article has precedence over or trumps the other. The exercise of parallel analysis requires the court to examine the justification for interfering with each right and the issue of proportionality is to be considered in respect of each. It is not a mechanical exercise to be decided on the basis of rival generalities. An intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual cases is necessary before the ultimate balancing test in the terms of proportionality is carried out."</span></p>

With the benefit of senior police officers behind her and perhaps from her own knowledge, she tells me that it is not police practice to identify a minor upon arrest or indeed upon charge.  Consideration in respect of the identification of a minor will only arise at the first court appearance.  Miss McMahon, with entirely appropriate professional candour, also acknowledges that Parliament has enacted legislation, albeit not yet in force, which provides for the anonymisation of minors in the criminal justice process.</span></p>

This is because stories about particular individuals are simply much more attractive to readers than stories about unidentified people. It is just human nature. And this is why, of course, even when reporting major disasters, journalists usually look for a story about how particular individuals are affected. Writing stories which capture the attention of readers is a matter of reporting technique, and the European court holds that article 10 protects not only the substance of ideas and information but also the form in which they are conveyed: News Verlags GmbH&amp;Co KG v Austria 31 EHRR 246, 256, para 39, quoted at para 35 above. More succinctly, Lord Hofmann observed in Campbell v MGN Ltd <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 AC 457" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 AC 457</ref>, 474, para 59, judges are not newspaper editors. See also Lord Hope of Craighead in In re British Broadcasting Corpn <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 AC 145" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 AC 145</ref>, para 25. This is not just a matter of deference to editorial independence. The judges are recognising that editors know best how to present material in a way that will interest the readers of their particular publication and so help them to absorb the information. A requirement to report it in some austere, abstract form, devoid of much of its human interest, could well mean that the report would not be read and the information would not be passed on. Ultimately, such an approach could threaten the viability of newspapers and magazines, which can only inform the public if they attract enough readers and make enough money to survive.</span></p>

If the newspapers choose not to contest such an injunction, they are less likely to give prominence to reports of the trial. Certainly, readers will be less interested and editors will act accordingly. Informed debate about criminal justice will suffer.__ Mutatis mutandis, the same applies in the present cases. A report of the proceedings challenging the freezing orders which did not reveal the identities of the appellants would be disembodied. Certainly, readers would be less interested and, realising that, editors would tend to give the report a lower priority. In that way informed debate about freezing orders would suffer.</span></p>

The identities of persons charged with offences are published, even though their trial may be many months off. In allowing this, the law proceeds on the basis that most members of the public understand that, even when charged with an offence, you are innocent unless and until proved guilty in a court of law. That understanding can be expected to apply, a fortiori, if you are someone whom the prosecuting authorities are not even in a position to charge with an offence and bring to court. But, by concealing the identities of the individuals who are subject to freezing orders, the courts are actually helping to foster an impression that the mere making of the orders justifies sinister conclusions about these individuals. That is particularly unfortunate when, as was emphasised on the appellant&#8217;s behalf, they are unlikely to have any opportunity to challenge the alleged factual basis for making the orders.</span></p>

After all, it could be said, what actually matter are the legal and constitutional issues raised in the proceedings and these can be understood and debated on the basis of an anonymised report. But the very fact that M and the other appellants are not accepting, but challenging, the whole system of freezing orders based on mere suspicion means that they are presenting the orders as wrongs done to them, rather than as indications that they themselves have done something wrong. Concealing their identities runs counter to the entire thrust of that case. Should their appeals be allowed, concealment would be even less appropriate. Not E but Mr John Entick of Stepney has gone down in history as the plaintiff in the great case of Entick v Carrington (1765) 19 State Tr 1029. </span></p>

So those identities may not matter particularly to the judges. But the legitimate interest of the public is wider than the interest of judges qua judges or of lawyers qua lawyers. Irrespective of the outcome, the public has a legitimate interest in not being kept in the dark about who are challenging the TOs and the AQO. The case of HAY is instructive in this respect. Most people will be astonished, for example, to learn that, up until now, the courts have prevented them from discovering that one of the claimants, Mr Youssef, has already successfully sued the Home Secretary for wrongful detention after a failed attempt to deport him to Egypt. Equally importantly, even while the Treasury is defending these proceedings brought by him, the Government are trying to have his name removed from the 1267 Committee list. Meanwhile, he is busy writing and broadcasting from London on Middle East matters.</span></p>

The consequence of this, it is argued, is that reporting of these very important issues is, for a combination of financial and simple human interest reasons, given a much lower profile. Thus it follows that important material is not released into truly informed public debate to the extent that the subject matter properly demands.  Again, I have summarised the argument in a way which I hope does justice to Ms. McMahon&#8217;s fuller analysis.  This point is one that I have given great consideration to.  It is possible to contemplate circumstances in which it might prevail.  I am however entirely satisfied that this is not the case here.</span></p>

For the avoidance of any ambiguity, I have found that applies here.  However, certain categories of children within the system are also perceived to be a risk to others.  Society&#8217;s reaction to such children can often be alarming.  These children frequently become particularly vulnerable within the system.  The findings I make will, I suspect, cause real alarm to those who read the judgment.  I am required to sift and analyse facts and to establish those facts within the framework of the law, inevitably that requires consideration of a raft of information within the judgment itself.  Cases of this kind are, happily, still relatively rare but the consequence is that this only makes it easier to link child protection proceedings with concurrent criminal investigation.  Thus the potential for very sensitive information to enter the public domain as a result of journalists recognising the link (&#8216;the jigsaw effect&#8217;) is manifest.  Here, it is not only a real risk, it is a probability.  Not only is the child identified and therefore vulnerable but there is, in my judgement, a real risk that the criminal investigation itself might be compromised.  In short, I do not consider the competing Article 8 and 10 rights here to be delicately poised.  I would however observe, that which I hope is obvious from the above reasoning, that the essence of such an exercise is so fact specific that, as events unfold, there will be occasions when the balance might shift.</span></p>

I have on a number of occasions during the exchanges with counsel in this case compared radicalisation cases to those involving the sexual exploitation of children.  The identification and grooming of minors often through internet connection has striking parallels with sexual grooming.  I made the observation in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt">Tower Hamlets LBC v M &amp; Ors <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/869" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 869 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 869 (Fam)</ref>.</span><span style="font-size:14pt">  Of course, when these codes of practice were written abuse of minors by way of radicalisation was not in contemplation.  The comparisons I have identified trigger, to my mind, the same need for protection.  In any event the entire balancing exercise here again falls heavily towards the protection of the children even when, as here, that affords collateral protection to a parent who, in isolation, might not obtain it.  </span></p>
