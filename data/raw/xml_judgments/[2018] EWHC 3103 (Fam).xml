      <blockContainer>
	<num>14</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.51in">AB&#8217;s circumstances were set out in full in a witness statement from an experienced mental health social worker who has known him since August 2014.  The salient facts were as follows: AB was arrested in 2006 and charged with two counts of rape and one count of sexual assault of a child. The victim was his half-brother who was aged five at the time of these offences.  The sexual abuse had taken place in the home which AB shared with his stepbrother, stepsister, father and stepmother.  It was also alleged that AB had sexually abused his ten-year-old stepsister and his younger teenage brother.  AB was bailed on the condition he had no unsupervised contact with persons under the age of seventeen.   </p>
      </blockContainer>
      <blockContainer>
	<num>15</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.51in">In 2008 AB was convicted and in 2009 the criminal court imposed a hospital order under </p>
      </blockContainer>
      <p style="margin-left:0.92in;text-indent:0in">s.37 together with a restriction order under s.41 of the MHA.  It is noteworthy that, whilst awaiting sentence, AB was found to be in breach of his bail conditions.  A sixteen-year-old girl with a learning disability, who was the sister of one AB&#8217;s friends, accused AB of raping her.  No charges were brought against AB as it was believed AB and this young girl had had consensual sexual intercourse.   </p>
      <blockContainer>
	<num>16</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.51in">Medical assessments of AB prepared for his sentencing revealed that he had an assessed IQ of 71, which amounted to a mild learning disability.  I also note that AB&#8217;s early history described him being a witness to domestic violence between his parents as well as being the victim of physical abuse from his mother&#8217;s then-partner following the divorce of his parents.  He was also the victim of physical and verbal abuse from his stepmother following his father&#8217;s remarriage.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in">AB was discharged from hospital on 7 June 2016 by the First-tier Tribunal pursuant to s.73 of the MHA on conditions which included a requirement to comply with his care and risk management plan.  It was clear that AB had the capacity to understand and consent to his care, support and accommodation arrangements, despite his diagnosis of a mild learning disability.  There was nothing in the papers that I read which suggested that he lacked capacity in this regard.   </p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_18">
	  <num>18</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in">Since his discharge AB&#8217;s compliance with his care and treatment has been good.   He has been able to identify factors which would increase his risk of re-offending and has worked hard to maintain a good level of motivation and engagement with those managing him.  He says he wants to improve his life as he does not want to go back into hospital.  He continues to require twenty-four-hour supervision to prevent re-offending.  This supervision is provided by a specialist service which is experienced in supporting adults with forensic histories in community settings.   </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_19">

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in">The conditions which amount to a deprivation of AB&#8217;s liberty are as follows.  He is supported - that is supervised - at all times across a twenty-four hour period including when he is visiting his family.  All support staff ensure that AB is always supported - that is supervised - and that he always has someone to talk to if he should feel the need and also ensure that AB must be supported to maintain the conditions of his conditional discharge.  Those conditions are,  firstly, to reside in an accommodation approved by the clinical team; secondly, to be compliant with healthcare appointments; thirdly, to be compliant with his care plan and risk management plan; fourthly, not to have contact, either directly or indirectly, with his victims; and, fifthly, not to have access to legal or illegal pornographic materials.   </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_20">
	  <num>20</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in">AB consented to these conditions in 2016 and continues to do so.  His care and risk management plans are reviewed every three months by the project supervising him and every six months by a multi-disciplinary team of professionals.  AB is a registered category 1 sexual offender who also voluntarily wears a tag.  He understands that if he does not adhere to his care and risk management plan it would be likely that he would be recalled to hospital very quickly.   </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_21">
	  <num>21</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in">There remain real risks to others arising from AB&#8217;s community placement, which are set out in the social worker&#8217;s statement.  The nature of his index offences place children and young people at risk from his behaviour, which has been in the past impulsive and opportunistic, especially when AB is feeling overwhelmed by known personal risk triggers.  It was clear from what I have read that, without an extremely high level of monitoring and support, AB&#8217;s feelings of anxiety and self-isolation could be instrumental in a repetition of his offending behaviours.   </p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_22">
	  <num>22</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in">The most important risk management factor is that AB is directly supported and supervised.  AB&#8217;s multi-disciplinary team supports the care plan on the basis that it is appropriate to authorise his continuous support and supervision in the interests of his wellbeing and so as to reduce the risk of his re-offending.   The care plan allows him to live safely in the community with the benefit of protective measures to keep others and AB himself safe from harm.   </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in">In essence, and I put it very simply, AB&#8217;s care plan requires him to be supervised at all times, save when he is with his mother on very, very limited occasions.  She is then responsible for supervising him during those times.   </p>

The first of these was for the applicant to do nothing and wait for any claim or challenge by AB for judicial review and/or a claim for damages under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>.  This was because at the moment the care plan to which AB is subject is precisely the sort of care plan which the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">MM </span>had declared was unlawful and to which AB could not consent. The applicant made no admissions in respect of any claim for judicial review and/or damages and did not accept that any such claims would succeed, but recognised that there would be considerable uncertainty in such a situation. </p>

This would inevitably result in a significant reduction in his supervision and control and would be likely to create a real risk that AB would be recalled to compulsory detention in hospital because of either his actual or apprehended behaviour.   </p>

The establishment of a statutory scheme to bring the cases in this hinterland before the Court of Protection would represent an almost impossible task, whereas the ability of the common law to develop and adapt its jurisdiction, on a case by case basis, as may be required, may meet this need more readily.&#8221; </span></p>
