      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Ms K was born in 1952 and is now 60 years old. She has Down&#8217;s syndrome. Her learning disability is severe and is associated with receptive and expressive communication difficulties. She knows and repeats certain words to indicate her wishes, such as &#8216;shopping&#8217;, &#8216;not shopping&#8217;, &#8216;bowling&#8217;, &#8216;not bowling&#8217;, &#8216;coffee&#8217;, &#8216;pretty, pretty&#8217;. She will sit on her hands if she does not want to do something and look away. If she is unsure what she wants to do, she tugs her sleeves down over her hands. Her IQ was once assessed as being 30.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">From her birth until December 1991, C lived in her family home. She was cared for by her parents and then by her mother alone during her final years there. Her mother passed away in 1995.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In December 1991, with her mother no longer able to meet her needs, C moved to StMC.  It is recorded that her sister, Mrs T, made the decision to place her there.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Between 1991 and 1994, there was a significant deterioration in C&#8217;s well-being. Various assessments were completed and it was concluded that the placement was inappropriate.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In October 1996, C moved to a different residential placement, AH.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In 2001, Mrs T requested that C be placed nearer her family, in order to facilitate contact. Mrs T had identified LH, which would also provide her sister with the benefits of a &#8216;more active peer group&#8217;.  C moved there in October 2001.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">There were a number of problems at LH. Allegations of verbal abuse and poor care led to two members of staff being dismissed. The Care Standards Commission was concerned that Mrs T was recording conversations. It was reported that Mrs T has been visiting the home at odd times; also that she had visited all of the group&#8217;s homes in order to obtain a director&#8217;s home telephone number. The director thought that Mrs T seemed unwilling to work with him and the other agencies, &#8216;instead seeking to dictate to all professional parties involved.&#8217; Some staff felt intimidated by her. The outcome was that LH gave C notice.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Following a social care assessment, a placement was identified for C on the south coast. Mrs T refused to agree to this and proposed that her sister be placed at AH2. The care manager was concerned that it might be unsuitable the other service users were significantly more able. However, C commenced living there in October 2003.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In August 2008, Mrs T expressed concerns about her sister&#8217;s care and recommended a move to C Care Home. A move took place on 8 August and C has lived there ever since. According to a note, AH2 advised the out-of-hours emergency service that Mrs T had removed C&#8217;s belongings from AH2:</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0.59in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">&#8216;Mrs T has apparently found another home for C and has informed staff that C will not be returning. C&#8217;s new destination is not known. C has apparently not seen the home and staff are concerned as to [her] welfare.&#8217;</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In September 2008, there were concerns that Mrs T was calling C Care Home at 2am and disturbing residents; that she &#8216;bullied&#8217; staff; and that she was &#8216;intervening inappropriately, i.e. cancelling hospital appointments for C and a social care review.&#8217;</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In July 2009, Mr and Mrs T moved to their present home, some 65 miles from C Care Home, in order to be near their daughters. </span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Mrs T indicated that she would like C to be considered for HL, a placement near her new home. C was taken on a visit but refused to enter the home. According to the IMCA, C was happy and settled at C Care Home. She was demonstrating by her actions that she did not wish to move there. She had also &#8216;demonstrated reluctance in the past 6 months to go out with her family.&#8217;</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Ms T continued to raise concerns about C Care Home. A GP supported a move to HL on the grounds that it would provide &#8216;greater stimulation, a more able peer group and greater geographical proximity to her close relatives.&#8217; However, subsequently, the GP stated that he had limited knowledge of C and was unable to comment on her communication skills &#8216;due to lack of familiarity with her case.&#8217;</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In September 2009, Mrs T complained to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) about the care home&#8217;s management of her sister&#8217;s catheter and an alleged lack of access to day activities. Mrs T requested that an alternative placement be identified.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In December 2009, a best interests meeting was convened in response to Mrs T&#8217;s request that C be placed much closer to Mrs T&#8217;s home. The outcome was that, &#8216;It was agreed by all professionals involved that it was in C&#8217;s best interests to remain at C Care Home.&#8217;</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In April 2010, Mrs T was advised to consider making an application to the Court of Protection if the differences concerning her sister&#8217;s place of residence could not be reconciled.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">The local authority formally reviewed Ms K&#8217;s case and circumstances on 4 August 2010. The outcome was that her residence at C Care Home was appropriate and met her needs.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In October 2010, the local authority advised Mrs T that it intended to make an application to the Court of Protection.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In the event, Mrs T applied to the Court of Protection first, on 5 November 2010.</span></p>

      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">C Care Home is a two story building on a residential road. It is separated into three apartments, each with a kitchen, lounge/dining area and bathroom facilities. There is a patio area with a barbeque and gazebo. A large wooden hut in the garden serves as the &#8216;activity&#8217; space. The only entrance to the home is at the back of the building through a gate into the garden, which leads to entrances to the three wings.</span></p>
      <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Ms K&#8217;s bedroom is on the ground floor. It has a single bed, chest of drawers, cupboard, sink, mirror and bubble machine. On her bedside table there is a large framed photograph of Mrs T and her family.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Each resident has a day in the week when they develop their home skills, for example vacuuming, washing clothes or baking. For the rest of the week the residents are engaged in activities in or outside the home, for example music sessions with a visiting therapist, arts and crafts or walks around the village. Barbeques are arranged and C enjoys sitting outside when the weather is nice. She walks around the home as she pleases and often goes into the other apartments to see her friends.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">A yearly review report details her needs, medical appointments, medication, physical care, diet, bathing, interpersonal and social skills, relationship with peers and staff, family contact, social contacts, leisure/social programme and use of community facilities. It also assesses her self-help skills and any significant changes since her last review. </span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Mrs T and her family would like to have C living closer to them. The journey times to C Care Home are an issue for them and restrict their ability to give time to C.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">The total number of recorded visits made by Mr and Mrs T to Ms K at C Care Home amounted to 47 days in 2010, 40 days in 2011 and 16 days so far in 2012. Mrs T has made seven short visits to C Care Home in 2012.</span></p>
      <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In Mrs T&#8217;s opinion, C Care Home is &#8216;inappropriate and unsuitable.&#8217; Specifically, the peer group there are largely wheelchair bound, unlike Ms K; they are unable to interact with her because of their &#8216;lack of capacity&#8217;; and there is a &#8216;lack of facilitation for Ms K to maintain full and active contact with her family each weekend at the family home as she always has done.&#8217;</span></p>

The court declared in the interim that it was in Ms K&#8217;s best interests to continue to reside at C Care Home.

On balance, it is my view that it is CK&#8217;s best interest to remain at C Care Home as to move her will potentially undermine the stability and the progress that she has made to-date. While other service providers may be able to provide a similar service level as well as opportunities for CK that are broadly similar it is my view that this represents a risk of disruption and allied distress and anxiety that is not outweighed by possible advantages.&#8217;</span></p>

	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">C had been placed at AH for approximately 12 years, which was only 10 miles away at the time.

	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Likewise, when C moved to C Care Home, Mrs T was living around 25 miles away and would take her out regularly at the weekend.</span></p>

	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Ms K responded well to her nieces and was stimulated by the toddler in the household. She enjoyed being at Mrs T&#8217;s family home.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">It was not C&#8217;s choice that these habitual arrangements should stop.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Mr P had contemplated fortnightly visits to Mrs T&#8217;s home, with the burden of transporting her there and back being shared by the family and service providers.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">There was no reason why the familiarity of the present care home could not be re-established elsewhere.

	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Ms K&#8217;s anxiety needed a source. It was unlikely that she would experience stress in a new care home if it had a benevolent atmosphere and the staff were warm. C responded to &#8216;positivity,&#8217; to people who took an interest in her and asked her questions. It would take only &#8216;a few days or a week&#8217; for C to strike up a rapport with someone with the required approach.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Mrs T had given priority to group activities at C Care Home and arranged visits around them.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">It was not feasible to take C to Mrs T&#8217;s home other than occasionally because this doubled the travelling distance. Mrs T would have to collect C, take her to Mrs T&#8217;s home area, drive her back to C Care Home, and then drive herself home.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">The contact problems started in mid-2009. Until then, staff had accompanied C to the front door of the home when Mr and Mrs T visited, and she had gone on many local walks with them. In around June 2009, Mr and Mrs T were told by staff, &#8216;We can&#8217;t bring her to the front door anymore. We&#8217;ve been instructed not to bring her to the front door.&#8217; Mr and Mrs T &#8216;were told to go into the bowels of the house&#8217; to collect her. C was confused by this change of routine &#8216;and didn&#8217;t get up and go out with us&#8217;. That became the pattern. </span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Mrs T said that she could &#8216;pinpoint no other reason&#8217; for the change. However, under cross-examination, she accepted that there had been occasions before June 2009 when C had not wanted to go out with them.  That did not deflect from the fact that in general C thrived on contact with her family.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">C did experience &#8216;short periods, lasting between a few minutes and several months&#8217; during which she went &#8216;through various demeanours.&#8217; However, there had also been many occasions when she had enjoyed their company and outings.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">It was &#8216;not accepted&#8217; that the visit on 7 February 2009 was the trigger for C&#8217;s change of behaviour and subsequent refusals to go out with Mr and Mrs T.  C &#8216;was fine that day.&#8217; She had been standing in a sunny corner and did not want to get straight into the car because there was snow on the ground. Mrs T had ensured that there was no ice. By the following weekend, C would not have had any recollection of the previous visit.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">It was not the case that Ms K was now more confident and able to express her wishes about visits by Mr and Mrs T. &#8216;As long as she is in the right demeanour to start with, she enjoys my visits and our contact. There were many positive contacts during this period.&#8217; Her sister had greatly enjoyed Christmas with the family.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Nor was it the case that Ms K&#8217;s routine of meeting them at the door changed because her wishes and feelings about visits had changed. The opposite was true; her behaviour changed because of the change in routine.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">It was not correct that Ms K refused to enter HL because she understood or sensed that consideration was being given to a move there. That was jumping to conclusions. She &#8216;would not have recognised it as a place for people with learning disabilities&#8217; and lacked the capacity to understand abstract concepts involving future residence. C did sometimes hesitate before entering a new environment, such as a shopping centre, and she did &#8216;not have an easy rapport with new places and faces.&#8217;</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">The travel costs to C Care Home were &#8216;pretty crippling&#8217;. </span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Mrs T drove, her husband does not. If he visited alone, he travelled by public transport at a cost of &#163;15 return.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Mrs T was not aware of C forming any other close relationships since fellow resident A&#8217;s death.</span></p>

	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">C was sometimes already distressed when Mr and Mrs T arrived. She was not distressed by their arrival. Sometimes she needed &#8216;a little time to adjust, just like anyone.&#8217;</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">It was not true that C was distressed by Mrs T&#8217;s visits but not by those from her daughters (C&#8217;s nieces).</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">The reason she had not taken up the local authority&#8217;s offer of funding for two visits by C to Mrs T&#8217;s home was because she was worried that accepting it might have a negative effect on her application. If the court&#8217;s decision went against her, she would not necessarily take up the offer (&#8216;We would appeal&#8217;).</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">There had only been one, not 15, incidents of C being returned to C Care Home with an over-full catheter bag. The catheter care at the care home had been deficient. In May 2012, Mr T visited C. She did not seem very happy. As she got up, he could see that her skirt and the chair were soaked.</span></p>
	    <p class="StyleCalibriBefore6ptAfter12ptLinespacing15lin" style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">When her sister first used a catheter, there were occasions when everyone struggled to get accustomed to it.

One cannot, as it were, attribute any particular a priori weight or importance to P's wishes and feelings; it all depends, it must depend, upon the individual circumstances of the particular case. And even if one is dealing with a particular individual, the weight to be attached to their wishes and feelings must depend upon the particular context; in relation to one topic P's wishes and feelings may carry great weight whilst at the same time carrying much less weight in relation to another topic.

At the end of that exercise the judge should be better placed to strike a balance between the sum of the certain and possible gains against the sum of the certain and possible losses.

On 21 November 2011, the local authority provided the names of two potentially suitable care homes. On 28 November, Mrs T wrote that she did not consider either home to be suitable. On 30 November 2011, C&#8217;s representative confirmed that the only placements that Mr P would therefore be asked to review were KL and VS. Mrs T later asked that RCH be considered by Mr P (one of the homes previously rejected by her as unsuitable). However, for the reasons set out in his second report he did not do so. Mrs T has not identified any other possible suitable placement. </span></p>
