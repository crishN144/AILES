The Judgment concerned two girls, ZY (now aged 7), and YY (aged 5). AZ is their Mother (&#8220;Mother&#8221;) and BY is their Father (&#8220;BY&#8221;). There is a second set of proceedings concerning ZX (aged 6 months), who has the same Mother, but the Father is EX (&#8220;EX&#8221;). The first proceedings ended in December 2023 with a Special Guardianship Order (&#8220;SGO&#8221;) for ZY and YY in favour of the Paternal Grandparents (BY&#8217;s parents). </p>

Firstly, a Snapchat message dated 4 July 2021 which the Mother says supports her case that EX only met ZY and YY on 4 July 2021, rather than the earlier date in late November 2020, which the Judge had found. The Mother says that she only recovered the Snapchat message in early 2024.  Secondly, that there is subsequent material which undermines the medical evidence before the Judge and her findings. </p>

On 26 October 2021 ZY was given a child sexual abuse medical undertaken by Dr Ongosi, a paediatrician employed at Nottingham Sexual Abuse Referral Centre (&#8220;SARC&#8221;). The SARC is a unit at Nottingham University Hospital, operated by the NHS Trust. She produced a report to which I will revert below. On 2 November there was a further hearing, and the court ordered that the girls live with their Paternal Grandparents.</p>

The presence of genital warts influenced both treating and expert Doctors, which was on the understanding that the Mother had not had genital warts. However, based upon the medical evidence that came in after the experts had given that evidence, the judge accepted that genital warts could have been passed from the Mother.&#8221;</span></p>

This court could only intervene if it found that there had been a failure to consider the whole of the evidence in a rational manner. In fact, the judgment shows that the recorder approached her task with considerable care and reached conclusions that were clearly open to her on the evidence.</span></p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in"><span style="font-style:italic">The grounds of appeal, amplified in various respects in the skeleton argument, are not persuasive. The threshold was plainly crossed in this case. The finding that [ZY] has experienced sexual abuse was securely based on the medical evidence, taken in the context of the evidence as a whole. The consequential conclusion that the applicant is one of the individuals who may have perpetrated the abuse was founded on the court&#8217;s assessment of the evidence, including her own evidence. The recorder adequately explained why, at the same time as making serious findings of domestic abuse against the Father, she did not include him in the pool of perpetrators of sexual abuse. That was a judgement for her to make and this court would not disturb it. Finally, the judgment contains a sufficiently balanced account of the relevant factors, including those favourable to the applicant, for it not to be susceptible to an appeal.</span></p>

Over this time, minor injuries (such as superficial abrasions or lacerations) could have healed without any sign. Furthermore, consensual sexual intercourse and vaginal rape after puberty do not necessarily cause genital injury. Therefore, in this case, acute signs of injury would not necessarily have been expected."</p>

The Judge placed no weight on these parts of Dr Gray's evidence given that the Judge was not confident that they fell within her expertise.</p>

The evidence on the older hymenal defect, and whether it is indicative of an older injury may be consistent with normal variation. I feel it would be unsafe to rely on this. In respect of the healed laceration at 7 o'clock, that does seem to indicate that something occurred. Given that I have found the story about the sex toy impossible to believe, there is some evidence of sexual penetration, which fits with the allegation of abuse. However, given the lack of clarity over the medical evidence, I put very limited weight on this evidence.&#8221;</p>

The LA did not rely upon the SARC report. Sexual abuse was found on other evidence. No evidence was given by SARC, but Dr Gray was called to give evidence. The Judge described Dr Gray as an impressive witness, and that her evidence was a model of clarity. He said:</p>

Having heard Dr Gray and read her reports, I am satisfied that her analysis of the examinations of XX is consistent both with the academic literature in this area and her professional experience of the dangers of overinterpreting what may very well be normal features in the development of a post-pubescent girl and cannot therefore support or undermine XX&#8217;s allegations in this case.&#8221;</span></p>

Ms Bashir raises one additional argument, which is that the family members who supported EX having met the girls well before 4 July 2021 had not, at that stage, fallen out with the Mother, and had no reason to lie about the evidence on this point. Further, at the point where they gave that evidence there was no reason for them to understand the importance of the issue which strengthens their credibility in this regard. </p>

This is largely for the reasons given by the LA. The Mother, and EX, face a constellation of findings by the Judge which are not affected by the Snapchat message. Although the issue of the date EX met the girls was undoubtedly important, I can see no sensible forensic reason why it would have changed a large number of the Judge&#8217;s other findings. In particular she found that the Mother had been dishonest on a series of points and she did so on very clear evidence. Those findings were wholly independent of the date of meeting EX. </p>

It is correct that the genital warts are recorded before July, but those are but one indicator of sexual abuse. The Judge did not suggest that the presence or otherwise of the genital warts was itself determinative, it was merely another factor that pointed to sexual abuse having occurred. </p>

In that period SARC has reported on approximately 2000 cases. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It does appear that Dr Gray takes a different view of certain indicators of sexual abuse from some of the clinicians at the SARC. It is important to put these differences again in context. It is apparent from the various reports, caselaw and judicial knowledge that sexual abuse, save in the most clear cut cases, cannot be determined by medical examination alone. There are various indicators, and different clinicians put somewhat different weight on those indicators. That is ultimately a matter of clinical and professional judgement. I note that there is nothing in Dr Fildes&#8217; witness statement that suggests any regulatory concerns around the practice of any of the clinicians at the SARC.  </p>
