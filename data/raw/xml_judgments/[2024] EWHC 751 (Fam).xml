Most of the preparation has been done, and it is a case which will be heard on submissions alone. Given the father&#8217;s open offer, if the case does not settle in advance, the issues at the hearing will be relatively narrow.  Whilst I find that the mother will not reasonably be able to obtain legal services up to and including the next hearing without an order, I do not consider that  the sum that would be required is anything like the sum claimed.  I will therefore make an order for the payment of &#163;30,000 which really should be sufficient.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Despite the complexities in the case, I express the hope that the parties will be able to come to an agreement about the way forward without the matter needing to go to a full hearing.  The mother is undergoing some tests which may bring some clarity so far as the issues the father has raised are concerned. A is a child who has been seen regularly by professionals and teachers (and that continues to be the case).  It may be that terms can be agreed as to holidays, if it is possible for the father to provide sufficient reassurance that he would not retain A in Country X if permitted to take him on holiday.  In making these comments I make it clear that the proceedings are at an early stage and not all of the evidence is yet available.  I only make the obvious comment that the costs of proceedings in both financial and emotional terms is very high.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I am asked to make an order with respect to this application itself, for which the sum of &#163;25,320 is claimed.  It is right that the father did not make any offer to settle this application, making the hearing necessary.  Although I have not made an order in the sums sought by the mother,  the total sums for which I have made an allowance amounts to &#163;200,000.  I have determined that I should make a costs order. Having looked at the schedule sought, I do not consider the sums of money to be unreasonable given the level of representation of both of these parties.  I have, however, made an order which is well short of the amount the mother sought.  In all the circumstances I will make a costs order against the father in the sum of &#163;15,000.  I consider that the amounts sought were excessive but there was time between this application being issued and the hearing, and efforts should have been made to compromise.   The father&#8217;s stance remained at all times that the application should be dismissed.  </span></p>
