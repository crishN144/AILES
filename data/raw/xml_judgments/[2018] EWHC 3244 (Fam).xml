(2) There was no underlying condition which predisposed E to suffer fractures.  (3) They were all non-accidental injuries.  (4) They were inflicted either by the mother or by the&#160;father.</p>

In&#160;the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Birmingham City Council v HH &amp; S</span> [2005] EWHC 2885 Fam, Charles J said at paragraph 55:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"In my view the approach of the family court to earlier findings has three stages: firstly, the court considers whether it will permit any reconsideration or review of or challenge to the earlier finding, here referred to by the parents as a review.  If it does, the second and third stages relate to its approach to that&#160;exercise.  The second stage relates to and determines the extent of the investigations and evidence concerning the&#160;review.  The third stage is the hearing of the review, and thus it is at this stage that the court decides the extent to which the earlier findings stand, by applying the relevant test of the circumstances then found to exist."</p>

		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"The same three-stage approach applies in my judgment whether the issue arises before the same judge or a different judge; whether in the same or different proceedings; and whether in relation to the same or different children.  I do not, with all respect to Baker J's tentative comments, think that different approaches are called for in different forensic&#160;contexts.  The attempt to create such a forensic taxonomy would, I fear, be productive merely of satellite&#160;litigation.  Of course the application of the general approach in any particular case will reflect the circumstances of that case.</p>

In particular in the passage I have set out above, I add this: One does not get beyond the first stage unless there is some real reason to believe that the earlier findings require&#160;revisiting.  Mere speculation and hope are not enough.  There must be solid grounds for challenge, but for my own part, I would be disinclined to set the test any higher.</p>

I suspect that in significant part, they reflect the approach of Lord Nicholls in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (minors: sexual abuse: standard of proof)</span> [1996] 563.  Be that as it may, I think, with great respect to Macfarlane J that that nuance is&#160;wrong.</p>

Much&#160;will turn on the forensic context, and the circumstances of the particular case.  So far as concerns the third stage, the proper approach in my judgment, subject only to what I have said, is that spelt out by Macfarlane J in <span style="font-style:italic">Birmingham (number&#160;2)</span>.  There is an evidential burden on those who seek to displace an earlier finding, in the sense that they have to make the running.  But the legal burden of proof remains throughout where it was at the outset.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"The judge has to consider the fresh evidence alongside the earlier material before coming to a conclusion in the light of the totality of the material before the court.  I think that Charles J's phrase, 'a high test', is best avoided at this, as at previous,&#160;stages.  I can well understand why in the particular circumstances of <span style="font-style:italic">Birmingham (number 1)</span> where there were concurrent findings of two High Court judges and the Court of Appeal, Charles J used those words, but to elevate them to a test, a legal principle, is unwarranted, unnecessary and potentially misleading.  Indeed, I think with respect to Charles&#160;J that reference to 'a high test' at the third stage is simply wrong, essentially for the reasons given by Macfarlane&#160;J in <span style="font-style:italic">Birmingham (number 2)</span>."</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"Fractures to the metaphysis are highly specific for non-accidental injury, hence the term 'classic metaphyseal lesions' that is often applied.  The mechanism for the injury is a torsional twisting force combined with a distraction pulling force.  However, studies on infant pigs suggest the distraction force may be more important than the torsional force.  Accidental rib fractures in infants and young children are extremely rare. They only occur in sever traumatic episodes, such as unrestrained child in a motor vehicle accident, or a crushing injury; and in such circumstances are associated with mortality rates of 40 to 50 per cent.  Rib fractures may occur in children with metabolic or inherited bone disorders, for example, osteogenesis imperfecta.  There is no evidence for that here."</p>

None are deficient in vitamin D.  Vitamin D insufficiency, deficiency, may be caused by insufficient dietary intake, and low exposure to sunlight.  In utero, the foetus obtains vitamin D from the mother via the placenta, and is therefore dependent on mother's vitamin D levels.  Breast milk contains little vitamin D, and therefore a vitamin D deficient mother may not provide sufficient vitamin D in her breast milk to prevent insufficiency, deficiency in the infant.

There are typical changes within the skeleton, namely reduced bone density; widening and blurring of cranial sutures in infants, widening of the growth plates of the long bones; and cupping and fraying of the growth plates.  Changes are most marked at the knees, wrists, skull sutures, and anterior ribs in young children.

In his second report, of 30 November 2012, Dr Saggar advised that there was no mutation identified in either the COL1A1 or the COL1A2 genes, which most commonly account for mild forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, particularly where there is normal&#160;stature.

With high quality radiographs, the assessment that bone density is normal is usually straightforward.  However, the assessment of reduced bone density is more difficult.  In adults it is believed that approximately 40 per cent of bone mineralisation needs to be lost before it becomes obvious on x-ray.  There is no comparable data in children.   In addition, poor quality x-rays or variations in technique and/or post-processing of digital x-rays can lead to a false assessment of reduced bone density.</p>

Several of the images, particularly of the hands and feet, demonstrate quantum mottle.  This is a type of image noise, and produces a grainy image.  It is often caused when the x-ray dose is reduced excessively.  It can also result from poor optimisation of the imaging system for small children.  The images of the long bones also appear to have higher contrasts than I am used to seeing, possibly with the post-processing technique called edge enhancement.</p>

The imaging department at Great Ormond Street Hospital should be able to provide information on the x-ray dose and post-processing techniques employed, but no reprocessing of the x-rays will now be possible.

We&#160;were wondering if you could view two sets of x-rays that we have, as there are inconsistencies between them.  The first set of x-rays were done at Northampton General in April 2012 when E was 7 weeks' old.  The second set was done at Great Ormond Street Hospital in October 2012 when E was 8 months' old.  Also, when she was at Great Ormond Street, blue sclerae was seen, and mild diminished bone density was reported.  We had vitamin D testing done in August 2012.   My result was 26.8, my husband was 26.9, and our daughter was 25.8.  At this point, E was being supplemented with formula milk."</p>

Answer: The possibilities here are (a) it was not present; (b) it was present, but not visible on the Northampton radiographs; or (c) there were technical differences in the radiographic acquisition in the two hospitals that would account for the differences.  Radiographs are poor at assessing bone density in young children.</p>

Fracture susceptibility in the mildest form of osteogenesis imperfecta, namely type 1, usually manifests when infants become toddlers, and fall over.  On the occasion when E fell frequently prior to having her glasses, she did not fracture any bones.  A previous assessment through clinical genetics led to a genetic testing of two genes most commonly associated with OI type 1, namely COL1A1 and COL1A2.  The results shared with me in the case bundle show no mutations were found, although there was note made that larger changes within these genes, accounting for 2 per cent for those with OI, might not have been detected through this test.  There were no grounds indicating a clinical need to pursue further testing.</p>

E does not have clinical or molecular evidence of being affected with OI.  Indeed, there is no clinical evidence that she has an underlying genetic predisposition to be more susceptible to fractures.  As there does not appear to be any evidence that E has a genetic predisposition to being more susceptible to fractures, no further genetic testing is indicated.</p>

The necessary evidence includes my own clinical assessment of the family history, medical history and physical examination, as well as reviewing additional information in the results provided to me in the case bundles.  Although E did not allow me to conduct a hands-on physical examination, I am satisfied the scope of this information has allowed me to accurately draw this conclusion."</p>

Ms Storey for the father adopted the submissions made on behalf of the mother.  I trust Mr Peddie, QC and Mr&#160;Bailey on behalf of the mother will forgive me if I summarise their principal submissions in the following manner: (1) The parents were, prior to April 2012, unknown to social services or the police.  (2) Their care of E was observed to be good and gentle.  (3) D had suffered no physical harm in the care of his parents. (I interpose to say I accept and take account of all of those matters).  (4) The conclusions of a loss of bone density in respect of the October Great Ormond Street Hospital x-rays raises a real issue in respect of the findings of fact made in September 2012.  (5) These conclusions are supported by the opinion of Dr&#160;Watt, that the x-ray films appear subjectively slightly osteopenic but with no local pathology.  (6) The features of blue sclerae, the various descriptions of the absence or presence of Wormian bones, and the question of diminished bone density raise the possibility of a rare form of osteogenesis imperfecta, or other underlying medical condition which may account for E's fractures.  (7) In the premises, it is significant that an unknown course for E's fractures was not considered at the fact-finding hearing.  (8) The failure not to test E's vitamin D levels in 2012 was an unfortunate omission, and leads to the real possibility, given that she was tested as vitamin D insufficient, with borderline deficiency, that in April 2012 she was in fact vitamin D deficient which may have disposed her to fractures with no, or far lesser, force than normally expected or predicted.</p>

(2) The concerns raised by the radiologist at Great Ormond Street in respect of the October 2012 x-rays were comprehensively dealt with by the opinions of Dr Saggar and Dr Summers in 2013.  (3) There is in fact no real difference between the opinions expressed by Dr Summers in 2013, and Dr Watt in 2016, especially as clarified by Dr Watt in his answers to the supplemental questions raised by the parents after his first report of 27 October 2016.  (4) That any outstanding issues between them, i.e. the subjective assessment of slight osteopenia in the long bones were decisively resolved by the opinions and report of Dr Irvine, who was not required to attend and give evidence at this hearing.</p>

Her blood test results undertaken in April 2012 were reported as being normal, especially her calcium levels and phosphates.  There was nothing in these test results to suggest any clinically significant issue in respect of her vitamin D levels.  In any event, Dr Hislop considered a breast-feeding mother would have to be significantly vitamin D sufficient before E was at risk of suffering rickets, and the mother was not.</p>
