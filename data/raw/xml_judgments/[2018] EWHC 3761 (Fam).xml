On the 8th December the passport order was executed by the Tipstaff, and the Tipstaff arrested the father on the basis that the father was, in the opinion of the Tipstaff, failing to comply with his obligation in the order to reveal the whereabouts of the children.  The father was brought before Hayden J on the 10th December 2018, and was remanded in custody until the 12th December 2018. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.91in;margin-right:0.06in">On the 10th December 2018 Hayden J granted the father legal aid to be represented in the proceedings.  On the 12th December 2018 the matter came before Cohen J when the matter was further adjourned until today with the father again being remanded in custody to HM Prison Pentonville.  It was provided in that order that the court today would consider an application for the father's committal, or would consider a further period of remand if the hearing was not effective for any reason.  The father was given permission to file and serve a statement by 11.00 am on the 18th December 2018, i.e. by 11.00 am today. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.91in;margin-right:0.06in">On reading the paperwork last night, I was struck by the absence of any application for the committal of the father to prison in the prescribed form.  By virtue of Family Procedure Rules 37.10 it is provided at sub-rule (1) that, "A committal application is made by an application notice using the part 18 procedure in the proceedings in which the judgment or order was made, or the undertaking was given".  By sub-rule (3) it is provided that the application notice must: </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.41in;margin-right:0.06in">set out in full the grounds on which the committal application is made and must identify, separately and numerically, each alleged act of contempt including, if known, the date of each of the alleged acts and be supported by one or more affidavits containing all the evidence relied on." </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.91in;margin-right:0.06in">Moreover, in circumstances where r.37.10(1) requires the Part 18 procedure to be used, then that brings into play the notice periods in Part 18.  By r.18.8(b)(ii) it is provided that, "Any application notice must be served as soon as practicable after it is filed and in any event &#8230; at least seven days before the court is to deal with the application".  By r.2.9(4) it is provided that, "Where the specified period is seven days or less, and includes a day which is not a business day, that day does not count".  A business day is defined by r.2.3(1) as, "Any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, Christmas Day, Good Friday or a bank holiday". </p>

Now, it is certainly true that the court has power to waive the formal requirements in the rules.  This is provided by Practice Direction 37A, para.13.2, which provides that, "The court may waive any procedural defect in the commencement or conduct of a committal application if satisfied that no injustice has been caused to the respondent by the defect". </p>

For my part I cannot envisage the sort of circumstances where the court would waive the requirement of spelling out in detail in the application notice the grounds on which the committal application is made, and in affording the alleged contemnor the full period of notice provided for in the rules, which have been of course approved by Parliament. </p>
