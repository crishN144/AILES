He made other orders in relation to the transfer of various chattels, provided for a clean break and made no order as to costs.  He also ordered that, if there was an appeal in relation to his order, that the matter be transferred to the High Court to be dealt with by a Judge of the Division, with a time estimate of one to one and a half days.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">His order was premised on the basis of an equal division of all of the family assets, including the pensions, save for two assets held in the sole name of Mrs JS ("the wife"), which he ring-fenced and left in her sole ownership.  The justification for such being the facts that (i) the two assets had emanated from her family in 1996 and (ii) had been retained by her as separate property during the course of the marriage.  The two assets consisted of a 50 per cent share in her parents' matrimonial home at Duthie Road, Aberdeen (which was worth about &#163;72,500) and a bond (worth about &#163;114,200) which had been purchased with funds which had emanated from her family.  Those two assets totalled &#163;186,700 and represented about 8.6 per cent of the overall family assets.  Accordingly, by ring-fencing those assets in favour of the wife, the final division of family assets produced a 17 per cent differential between the parties.  It is the husband's case that that was unfair and plainly wrong in the circumstances of this particular marriage.</p>

The parties married on 2 July 1983 when they were respectively aged 34 and 27 years.  It was their first marriage.  Of course, it is immediately apparent given their ages that each had established themselves prior to their marriage.  So far as I can tell, the husband had gone to university and had graduated in 1974 with a BSc. Thereafter he took an MSc and DPhil.  He took up a job with Conaco.  The chronology indicates that as early as 1975 he purchased his first home in Louth.  Thereafter he moved to London and purchased a small two bedroomed flat in Ealing.  In 1997 he joined Oxidental Oil, which later transmogrified into Total Oil.  His job took him to Aberdeen where he purchased a property at 7 Westward Crescent (that being a three bedroom detached house) with an 85 per cent mortgage.  He joined his company pension scheme.  He was working in the oil industry, which at the time was, as everyone knows, one of the higher paid jobs available.</p>

She has informed the court through her counsel that she believes that throughout her life she has suffered from undiagnosed dyslexia with the result that she has always lacked confidence with written work.  As I understand it, in her early years, she worked for her father in his hire business.  Shortly after the marriage, the wife gave up her employment in order to care for her husband and, when they arrived, their two children.  </p>

In the end, they returned to the United Kingdom, primarily for the benefit of their children.  I doubt that this wife would have worked outside the home, even if she had not had commitments to the children and endured the expat life which I have described.  This was a conventional marriage of breadwinner and homemaker.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Each party brought to it different talents and made equal, if incommensurate, contributions to the welfare of their family - the husband through his prodigious earnings and the wife through her care for the family.  In addition, the wife came from a prosperous family, which hailed from Aberdeen.  Her father, A, was born in April 1921 (now 86 years old).  Her mother, C, was born in February 1924 (now 83 years old).  The wife is their only child and she is close to her parents.  Whilst the marriage subsisted and the parties were on good terms, the husband to a degree helped the W&#8217;s parents with their financial affairs, although there is a suggestion that on following his advice, they lost some money.  In any event, he was privy to their wills.  It was his evidence that in 2001 he knew that they had made mutual wills to the effect that there was to be a payment of the nil rate tax band to the wife, a life interest to the survivor of each of them, be that either the father or the mother, some small bequests to cousins and, after the death of the survivor who held the life interest, the balance to the wife.  It was the husband's evidence before the District Judge that he believed that the wife's parents had assets of between &#163;1 million and &#163;1.5 million, although he was unable to be specific it is right to point out that his information was outdated in the sense that he had not had any communication with them since about 2001.</p>

She told the District Judge that she had never discussed the issue with her parents and so did not know about their testamentary dispositions.  Under cross-examination she was asked whether she expected her parents to make any provision for her or would be surprised if they did not.  Her reply was, as the District Judge pointed out, that any daughter would have expectations.</p>

	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in">"The description by the husband of the assets of the parents and the contents of their Wills carried with it for me the ring of truth.  I am satisfied and find as a fact that the husband's recollection is accurate, particularly as there is no evidence from the wife to contradict what he says.  I therefore find as a fact that in 2000/2001 each of the wife's parents had made an identical Will leaving at least the amount of the inheritance tax relief to the wife, and possibly the remainder of their estate to her, subject to bequests, as a contingent interest."</p>

	      <subparagraph>
		<content>
		  <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in">"It seems to me that there is no firm evidence upon which I can find as a fact, on the balance of probabilities, that the wife will inherit on the death of her father, or her mother, whoever dies first, nor that it is remotely possible to assess the present value of their assets.  I am therefore not satisfied that that which is owned by the wife's parents is property which the wife "has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future"."</p>

		  <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in">"&#8230; if I am wrong in that, there is one principle which emerges very clearly from all the previous cases, and that is that an adjournment has been ordered where it is not possible to do justice fairly between the parties in relation to their existing assets and the settlement thereof.  In the case of Mr &amp; Mrs S, they have accumulated during the marriage substantial assets, which can be divided fairly between the parties such as to provide comfortably for the needs of each of them.  To use the words of Mrs Justice Bracewell, it is not necessary for there to be "an order for an adjournment as the only means whereby justice could be done to the parties"."</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">It is clear to me that a great deal of the three day hearing before the District Judge was taken up with consideration of whether the husband's application for a lump sum and transfer of property order should be adjourned to await the outcome of the wife's prospective inheritance, whether he should receive a designated percentage proportion of it or whether, were it to come to fruition, he were to receive a greater proportion of the current family assets to adjust for the fact that the wife had a future and, as he put it, &#8220;expected&#8221; inheritance. It was a topic of hot debate.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In fact this case took a great deal more than the estimated three days which I have already outlined.  During the course of the hearing, an issue arose as to whether the children's bank accounts and insurance policies which had emanated from the husband's resources, should be subject to a transfer of property order.  Thus, although the hearing was in November, the learned district judge reserved his judgment and in the following four weeks, he wrote to the parties' solicitors seeking clarification in relation to the issue of the children's trust.  He asked for an affidavit to be prepared to assist him with this point.  After he had received that document, he took further time to consider the matter, and in about February 2006 wrote for further information by way of a &#8220;questionnaire&#8221;.  </p>

It seems to me that cases such as this, which are not simple or run of the mill, a Form E is not sufficient to give the Court sufficient and full information.  Therefore, as a matter of course, parties should set out their case clearly in statements before the commencement of a trial.  This would avoid circumstances as arose in this particular case, with points arising during the course of the hearing which obviously caused the tribunal some concern.  By February 2007 the matter had been long delayed.  The District Judge finally handed down his judgment in April 2006.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">That in itself was not the end of the matter, for a further hearing was required to determine the terms of the order and consequential matters.  That was listed for half an hour in July 2006.  That hearing had to be adjourned for lack of time and a final hearing was offered to the parties on the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2006.  That was the day upon which the District Judge made his final order.  It is easy to see that many months had passed  since the proceedings were dealt with by him.  To my mind this chronology is most unsatisfactory for the parties and the court alike, particularly as it is costs-generative.  All delays mean that the litigation continues, with all professionals concerned required to read the papers each time there is a hearing.  That in itself is costly.  I do not consider that it is appropriate for any hearing of this type to be delayed in this way.  The costs before the District Judge were very high.  The husband's side have told me that their costs were &#163;60,000; the wife's some &#163;30,000.  That is a total of &#163;90,000, which I remind myself is about 4 per cent of this family's wealth.  The costs of this appeal have added to that burden.  Some &#163;22,000 worth of costs on the husband's side and &#163;14,700 on the wife's side, another sum approaching &#163;37,000.</p>

It is immediately apparent to me it approaches the amount of the assets that were &#8220;ring-fenced&#8221; by the learned District Judge.  It is a tragedy for this family that this amount of money has had to be spent.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In this case the parties did not have an effective FDR.  When the matter came before District Judge Jack on the date fixed for the FDR, he was informed that it could not go ahead.  His involvement on that occasion was so slightly that both of the parties accepted that he could, despite the rules, undertake the final hearing.  Obviously he had not sought to mediate in any way between these parties.  The FDR procedure must be undertaken in an effective way in every case, for it gives every party the opportunity to settle the litigation, to air the issues and to have neutral judicial evaluation at a time before the costs have denuded the parties' assets in the manner in which they have in this case.  As a general principle, therefore, I make it clear that where an FDR is not effective, it is incumbent upon the court to fix another appointment as soon as practicable in order to ensure that there be such mediation.  It must come before an experienced tribunal and it must be given sufficient time to enable that tribunal to read the papers fully and to engage with the parties/their professional teams in order that the matter can, if possible, be sorted out.  </p>

She attends Dundee University where she has taken a degree course in American Studies.  She is fast approaching full independence.  The parties' second child is C, was born on 4 June 1988 (nearly 19 years).  She is in her final year at Abbott's Home School.  This school specialises in dyslexia from which C suffers.  It is hoped that on completion of her public examinations, C will undertake some further training.  She would like to read English at university.  But, if she is unable so to do, she will certainly do something suited to her talents.  In any event, she is now also a young adult and will soon be fully independent.  The girls are Mr and Mrs W&#8217;s only grandchildren.  They have made generous provision for each of them in terms of an insurance policy or policies currently worth in excess of &#163;200,000 and due to provide some &#163;400,000 upon the death of the last surviving grandparent.  Those policies are written in trust for the benefit of the girls.  I understand that the trustee(s) are the mother and members of her immediate family.</p>

His contributions appear to have included some &#163;21,000 which came from his family.  The funds transmogrified over the years.  The girls now benefit from insurance policies worth about &#163;20,000 of which they are the primary objects (together with the husband's siblings and any other children he may have) plus bank accounts worth about &#163;150,000 in the round, which contain the proceeds of policies which have clearly matured.  Those funds were placed in building society accounts with the Leek Building Society in the husband's name but held for the benefit of each girl.  There is no formal trust documentation relating to these accounts, but clearly given the children's age, the husband holds those accounts as bare trustee for them.</p>

It seems to me that this was an inappropriate use of section 24 in the circumstances of this case.  In fact I considered he was plainly wrong given the girls&#8217; ages and the amount of the funds involved.  During the course of submissions, I gave certain indications to the parties' counsel about these funds.  Having scrutinised a schedule produced by the husband, it seemed that he had undertaken expenditure on behalf of the children which totalled about &#163;40,000, which could legitimately be deducted from the bank account monies.  Fortunately, the parties have come to terms in relation to that part of this appeal.  It has been agreed that the insurance policies shall remain extant and there is no need to change the terms of the various policies.  So far as the building society monies are concerned (totalling in excess of &#163;150,000) the parties are agreed, subject to the girls' final approval, that the monies which are due to the husband for his expenditure, namely some &#163;40,000, shall be deducted from them and shall be divided equally between the parents.  The remaining funds shall then be divided equally between the two girls.  One of the bank accounts will be placed in the mother's name for the benefit of C, the other account will remain in the father's name for the benefit of L.</p>

The Scottish proceedings were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction with the result that the husband began proceedings in England.  By that stage each of the parties was habitually resident in England and therefore it was clear that this was the appropriate jurisdiction.  Despite this the wife made a tactical decision to stall the English proceedings because her advisers thought that it was inappropriate for there to be a decree nisi before the case had either been settled or adjudicated.  Apparently this was in the belief that the decree nisi would inevitably lead to a decree absolute, which might prejudice the wife's rights as a widow under the various pension schemes which make up about 50 per cent of these parties' wealth.  Accordingly, when the matter came before the District Judge in November, there was no decree nisi.  </p>

This gave her a base with accommodation plus free board and lodging during term-time.  It also gave a 66.6 per cent reduction in the school fees.  The employment has paid her about &#163;10,600 net per annum, more likely to be &#163;12,000 per annum given a pay increase.  She has also been in receipt of working tax credit.  It is expected that she will reduce her workload once C leaves school.  The wife expects to work three day a week basis.  Even so, although she will lose her child benefit and child tax credit, her income will remain at the current level of about &#163;12,000 net because she will receive working tax credit.

In seeking to achieve a fair outcome, there is no place for discrimination between husband and wife and their respective roles.  Typically, a husband and wife share the activities of earning money, running their home and caring for their children.  Traditionally, the husband earned the money, and the wife looked after the home and the children.  This traditional division of labour is no longer the order of the day.  Frequently both parents work.  Sometimes it is the wife who is the money-earner, and the husband runs the home and cares for the children during the day.  But whatever the division of labour chosen by the husband and wife, or forced upon them by circumstances, fairness requires that this should not prejudice or advantage either party when considering paragraph (<span class="Emphasis">f</span>), relating to the parties' contributions.  This is implicit in the very language of paragraph (<span class="Emphasis">f</span>): "the contributions which <span class="Emphasis">each</span>&#8230; has made or is likely &#8230; to make to the <span class="Emphasis">welfare of the family</span>, including any contribution by looking after the home or caring for the family."  (Emphasis added.)  If, in their different spheres, each contributed equally to the family, then in principle it matters not which of them earned the money and built up the assets.  There should be no bias in favour of the money-earner and against the home-maker and the child-carer."</p>

		  <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in">"More often, having looked at all the circumstances, the judge's decision means that one party will receive a bigger share than the other.  Before reaching a firm conclusion and making an order along these lines, a judge would always be well advised to check his tentative views against the yardstick of equality of division.  As a general guide, equality should be departed from only if, and to the extent that, there is good reason for doing so.  The need to consider and articulate reasons for departing from equality would help the parties and the court to focus on the need to ensure the absence of discrimination."</p>

Such property could be seen as a contribution made to the welfare of the family by one party, however, where a claimant's financial needs could not be met without recourse to the inherited or given property, the source would carry little weight.</p>

This included his work-related pension, which when the parties married in 1983 had acquired 26 per cent of its value in terms of time.  The scheme itself was final salary based and so the 26 per cent had not accumulated in terms of value.  However, it cannot be gainsaid that in terms of time a quarter of it had been accumulated prior to this marriage.</p>

He was, therefore, discriminatory ring-fencing them.  Thirdly, it is asserted that he was plainly wrong when he ignored the wife's inheritance prospects and took no account of them.  He should, so it is submitted, have adjourned the case or given the husband a proportion of such inheritance as the wife received or, at the very least, have made an order that adjusted the current assets in the husband's favour to take account of this potential disparity.  Thus, the husband should have received 60 per cent to the wife's 40 per cent.</p>

Therefore, even on the basis of that part of the ruling in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Miller v McFarlane</span>, there is no entitlement in this case in relation to that inheritance.</p>

They each have similar income needs in the long-term.  In the case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Miller v McFarlane</span>, their Lordships may have suggested that the court should not pay much attention to the argument that a spouse who is &#8220;fully fledged&#8221; before the marriage has made a contribution which is valuable and should be taken into account.  I take particular note of what Lord Nicholls stated.  This pronouncement was appropriate in the context of the unusual factual matrix in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Miller v McFarlane</span>, but it flies in the face of the reality in cases such as this.  That is not to say that this type of contribution offers a definitive solution to this or any other case, but it is one of the factors which illuminates the fairness of the division of the parties' assets based on need.  This case is typical of many and I consider that it would be unfair and discriminatory to ignore each of the parties' contributions, whenever made, including that made by bringing monies in at the beginning of the relationship.  As time goes by, all assets become amalgamated and it would seem to me to be inappropriate to omit them from overall consideration.  </p>

Income from free capital, which I have taken as being &#163;335,000 to round it down, at 3.75 per cent net return (which is the Duxbury figure allowing for capital, growth) about &#163;12,500.  On this basis his income, if he earns &#163;12,000 would be in the region of &#163;37,500 per annum.

He will lose the additional pension of &#163;2,960 per annum which is paid until 65.  He will lose his earnings, so overall he will lose at least &#163;10,000 worth of his income in the long-term.  That means that he will have to Duxbury-ise his free capital to assist with expenditure.  Of course, he has the option to work harder and use the additional income that he has from now until 65 to set aside some savings.

I remind myself that this case has, in reality, been delayed from November 2005.

Thus I will order that periodical payments will be paid in a sum which amounts to about 4.5 per cent net on the outstanding balance of the lump sum.  This is a fair recompense for the wife being kept out of her funds since the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2006, when she should have been able to invest them for a proper return.</p>
