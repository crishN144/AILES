	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">In this case there is no dispute that H had been habitually resident in the United States until August 2022.  It is also agreed that his Mother had rights of custody for him and that she exercised those custody rights by agreeing for him to go to live for an undefined period in England with the Father.  Hence, it is common ground that the initial period when H was living in England was not &#8220;wrongful&#8221;.  It is also common ground that there came a time when the Mother demanded that H return to the United States and the Father refused to comply with that demand.  The Father thus accepts that, for the purposes of the Convention, he acted wrongfully at that point, but says that H had become habitually resident in the UK by the date of any wrongful act.  It is also agreed that, in making the decision as to whether H&#8217;s place of habitual residence has changed from the United States to England for the purposes of this case, I must identify the date of the Father&#8217;s wrongful act and make a decision where H was habitually resident at that date.  In this case, the Mother says that the Father acted wrongfully in November 2022 but the Father submits that he was not guilty of any wrongful act until July 2023.  The Father does not resist a conclusion that H had not yet become habitually resident in the UK by November 2022 but submits that the child had become habitually resident in the UK by July 2023.  In contrast, the Mother&#8217;s case is that H remained habitually resident in the United States in July 2023.  The Convention defences raised by the Father are only relevant if the Mother is successful in showing that, at the date of the wrongful act by the Father, H was still habitually resident on that date despite his period of stay in England.</span></p>

The Father is a UK citizen and the Mother is a citizen of the United States of America.  The Mother and the Father commenced a relationship in 2010. They married in Gibraltar in September 2015 and then lived for a short time in Ireland.  The Mother suffered a bout of depression and anxiety after her Father&#8217;s sudden death when she was aged 15 and accepts that she has had problems with her mental health at various points in her life.  She says that she was open with the Father about her mental health and &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">it was something we had in common</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8221;.   The Father has also had struggles with his mental health, battled alcoholism in the past and had a liver transplant before he met the Mother.  He says that he does not drink alcohol at all in order to protect his transplanted liver.</span></p>

It is not clear to me whether that was because of visa problems or because they chose to live apart, but it seems to be the latter.  H was born in the United States the on 15 August 2016, and is now aged 7.  H has joint UK and USA citizenship.  The Father was not present for the birth.  He was told in 2011 that he would be denied entry to the United States for a period of 5 years, but he has no idea what he has done to justify this decision being taken by the US immigration services.  </span></p>

The parties then lived together in the UK until the relationship failed and they separated in about May or June 2021.   The Mother was required to return to the United States because her UK visa was dependant on her being in a relationship with the Father.  However, before she left, the parties discussed and agreed arrangements for H.  These arrangements were set out in a consent order made in the Family Court in Birmingham on 31 January 2022, although by the date the order was made the Mother had already left the UK to return to the US.  This order provided that H will &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">live with</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8221; the Mother and it gave her permission to remove H from the UK and to live with him in Kansas.  It was agreed that H would spend a 6 week holiday each summer with the Father and for the Father to have H for alternative Christmas holidays.  It was also agreed that H would spend such further or other time with the Father as agreed between the parties.</span></p>

However, she was not able to do so because she could not get the appropriate immigration status and hence returned to the US with H in December 2021.</span></p>

It is clear that, in the late spring and summer of 2022, the Mother&#8217;s health and well-being was deteriorating. The contemporaneous documents disclosed in this case suggest that, at that time, the Mother had three different but interlinked problems.  First, she was drinking large quantities of alcohol and passing out when drunk, even though she was H&#8217;s main carer.  Secondly, she was taking illegal drugs and was described by her Mother as a drug addict, although it is unclear precisely what drugs she was taking.  She has referred herself to her smoking &#8220;weed&#8221; which I take as a reference to cannabis but there is also evidence that she was abusing prescription drugs including opioids.  Thirdly, the Mother had developed paranoid delusions about her own Mother, including believing that her Mother was trying to take H away from her.  That belief was not delusional because the evidence shows that MGM was so concerned about her daughter and grandson that she was in contact with social services and there was active discussion of the possibility of H either going into care or going to stay with his Father in England because of the risks to H from his Mother.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Both sets of US social services became involved in the case, largely as a result of being brought in by MGM.  The parties have managed to get part of the records from social services and the events in the period June to August 2022 are also detailed in a series of text messages between the Mother and the Father and between MGM and the Father.  Nonetheless, the exact sequence of events is not wholly clear, in part because the Mother was having such a serious mental health crisis at this time that she is unable to recall exactly what happened.  However, it appears that a time came in about June 2022 when MGM was so exasperated at her daughter&#8217;s drinking and drug taking that she threw her out of her house.  That meant that the Mother left with H and went to a hotel for a short period.  The Mother then went to live with MGM but her delusions continued and she then left with H to go to live on a farm with a cousin in the neighbouring state, about 50 miles away from her mother&#8217;s house.  There is some evidence of violence between the Mother and MGM at this time although it is unclear who was violent to whom.  The social services reports refers to H saying that MGM was violent to the Mother but the records also contains evidence to suggest the Mother was violent to MGM.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">There were calls between H and MGM and a time came when MGM collected H from the farm for his own safety.  When MGM attempted to keep H away from the Mother she was told by the police that, absent a court order, she could not do this because the Mother had parental responsibility for H.

Meanwhile, the Mother&#8217;s mental health crisis appears to have worsened and she was hospitalised.  It is not clear if the Mother was formally sectioned (under a procedure akin to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>) or was a voluntary patient.

There was no clear agreement as to how long H would spend in the UK, but it must have been implicit that the child would, at least, be staying until the Mother felt well enough and stable enough to resume caring for him.  Although I am confident that neither the Mother or the Father looked at these arrangements through the terms of the Family Court Order of 31 January 2022, I consider that Mr Bowe for the Father is right when he submits that the broad effect of the agreement was that H was given permission by the Mother in August 2002 under paragraph 4(c) of the order to travel to England to spend a period of time with the Father.  It was an open-ended permission without any clear agreement being reached at that time on an end date.  </span></p>

I have read large parts of these messages, albeit not every single message.  I am grateful to both counsel for drawing my attention to various aspects of these text messages.  The overall impression from the messages is that the Mother was always fearful that the Father would use her mental health crisis as a reason to keep H with him on a longer term basis and the Father, whilst assuring the Mother that this arrangement was not intended to be permanent, was largely reluctant to engage with precise dates when H should return.   I accept that the Father&#8217;s reluctance was, in the early months, largely driven by his concern about what he had learned about what had happened to H in the summer of 2022 and his fear that the Mother&#8217;s recovery was not as solid as she felt, and thus his fear that H would be returning to a potentially dangerous situation if he went back to the US before the Mother was fully recovered from her illness.</span></p>

At that point the messages make it clear that the Mother was taking the very clear position that H should return to the United States to live with her in order to start a new school term on 15 August 2023.  This is the first time that I can discern any form of clear ultimatum being given by the Mother or any clear failure by the Father to comply with an instruction that the Mother has given.  I accept that the Father started off with a reluctance to allow H to travel back to the United States because he was concerned that the Mother had not yet become well enough to care for his son.  It may well be that, as the months went on and as the relationship between him and his son improved, a point may have been reached at which the Father started to ask himself whether it would be better for H if the child stayed in his care on a longer term basis as opposed to going back to live with his Mother in the United States.  However, it seems to me more likely that the Father was responding to things on a week-by-week basis and the evidence does not suggest to me that he did anything specific or said anything specific to the Mother which showed he was resolved to prevent H from going back to live with the Mother at any point prior to July 2023.  In particular, he did not make an application to the Family Court to amend the terms of the consent order to allow H to continue living with him in the UK.  </span></p>

As I understand the Mother&#8217;s case as advanced by Mr Evans, it is that once the Mother raised the possibility that the time had come to discuss H&#8217;s return, the Father was under a positive duty to accept that concrete plans needed to be put in place for his return and the Father&#8217;s failure to do so amounted to a breach of the Mother&#8217;s rights as the custodial parent. Mr Evans acknowledged the difficulties caused by the absence of any clear evidence that the Mother withdrew her permission for H to stay in England or clearly demanded his return prior to July 2023, but he submitted I needed to be cautious when looking at the exchanges.  He accepted that, if there was no inequality of power between the parties, it was not wrongful for the Father to seek to persuade the Mother that the Father should keep H here for longer.  However, he said that there was real inequality of power between the parties here because the Mother wanted to maintain contact with H and so, to maintain contact, she felt unable to assert her authority as the custodial parent and to demand his return, but she was making her demands sufficiently clear that the Father acted wrongfully by not agreeing an earlier return date.</span></p>

First, it implies that the Father can act wrongfully by failing to act, namely by an omission, as opposed to taking a positive wrongful act.  Extending wrongfulness to a failure to act substantially expands the ambit of acts which could be wrongful beyond those identified by Lord Hughes as being limited to a &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">objectively identifiable act or acts of repudiation&#8221;.  </span><span style="font-size:12pt">Secondly, the Father&#8217;s response to this complaint is that he genuinely did not feel the Mother was well enough in November 2022 to resume full time care for H and therefore, in effect, he negotiated with the Mother for additional time.  Given that the genuineness of his position is not under challenge (and it could not be in a case where no oral evidence was called), his case is that, as long as the Father was continuing to negotiate about the length of time that H should stay in the UK based on what he feels are the best interests of his child and as long as the Mother has not clearly terminated her permission for H to stay in the UK or set out any form of ultimatum, he cannot be guilty of a wrongful act in the terms identified by Lord Hughes.  </span></p>

Whilst I can appreciate that the Mother may have been frustrated by the Father&#8217;s refusal to accept that she was well enough to care for H without exposing him to danger, and I also accept that she wanted to maintain contact, in my judgment neither factor prevented her clearly and unequivocally withdrawing her permission, as the custodial parent, for H to remain with the non-custodial parent, namely the Father.  It seems to me that, in contrast to the way that her case was put, her position as the sole custodial parent gave her very considerable power because she could tell the Father she was withdrawing her permission for H to be in England from a particular date and require him to come back to the US.  It was, I accept, a power that she was plainly reluctant to exercise.  Nonetheless the consequence, in my judgment, of her failure to clearly and unequivocally withdraw her consent to H remaining living with the Father and her continuance of the negotiations meant that the Father was not, in Convention terms, acting wrongfully.</span></p>

This will involve a real and detailed consideration of (inter alia): the child's day to day life and experiences; family environment; interests and hobbies; friends etc. and an appreciation of which adults are most important to the child. The approach must always be child driven. I emphasise this because all too frequently and this case is no exception, the statements filed focus predominantly on the adult parties. It is all too common for the Court to have to drill deep for information about the child's life and routine. This should have been mined to the surface in the preparation of the case and regarded as the primary objective of the statements. I am bound to say that if the lawyers follow this approach more assiduously, I consider that the very discipline of the preparation is most likely to clarify where the child is habitually resident. I must also say that this exercise, if properly engaged with, should lead to a reduction in these enquiries in the courtroom. Habitual residence is essentially a factual issue, it ought therefore, in the overwhelming majority of cases, to be readily capable of identification by the parties&#8221;</span></p>

Whilst I accept that a child can become habitually resident far more quickly in a new location if the child moves with the knowledge that the new location will be a permanent change (see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">A v A and another (Children: Habitual Residence) (Reunite International Child Abduction Centre and others intervening) [</span><span style="font-size:12pt">2014] AC 1), it is not the law that a child who comes for either a fixed period of time with an intended return date cannot become habitually resident in the child&#8217;s new location.  The same must be true for a child who comes for an undefined period of time.  If the child has a stable place to live with members of his own family in the new location and develops &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">some degree of integration by the child in a social and family environment&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> then the child may become habitually resident in the new location.  That new place of habitual residence will not be prevented from arising solely because one or other parents has the capacity to make decisions that will result in the child leaving this location.  Both counsel have accepted that the question as to whether H was habitually resident in the UK on the relevant day (whenever that was) is a matter of fact for me to determine, as best as I am able to do, within summary proceedings based on the documentary evidence.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">However, I would have been far more troubled by the defence under article 13(b).  In summary, I would have found that case was made out primarily because I do not consider that I was in a position to assess how much risk H would be exposed to if he returned to the US.  I accept that, if the Mother continues to take her medication, abstains from alcohol and abstains from illegal drugs, H will be at no grave risk of harm from her.  The Mother&#8217;s psychiatrist confirms that, as long as she takes her medication, she is no risk to H.   The Mother says that she has complied with all 3 requirements since the autumn of 2022 but no medical records have been disclosed and there is no evidence of the steps she has taken, if any, to address the psychological drivers which led to her alcohol and/or drug abuse in the past.  There is no evidence that she has attended Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar group or taken steps to understand how she came to abuse drugs and what steps she needs to take to minimise the chances that she will lapse back into narcotic abuse in the future.  Whilst I accept that her firm intention is to remain clean, at present there is a dearth of evidence to explain whether and if so how she is addressing the underlying issues which led her down that path in the first place.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The protective measures go some way to meeting those concerns but, in the end, I would not have found that they go far enough for the simple reason that all those mechanisms were effectively in place in the summer of 2022 and they did not prevent H going through the events that he describes and which could have been far more serious for him.  Counsel for the Mother says that I have to look at a short time window prior to family proceedings in the United States.  Whilst that is usually correct, I cannot ignore the fact that the Father does not have the financial means to commence litigation in the United States and that, in all probability, it will be many months if not longer before he can even get a visa interview and so cannot visit the United States to progress such an action.  It thus seems to me, that in assessing whether there is a grave risk to H, I have to consider a slightly longer time horizon.</span></p>

However, I accept that given what happened last summer and the continuing risks, there are serious questions as to how safe H will in fact be if he was to return to live with his Mother. I consider that those risks remain even if the measures that the Mother proposes were to be put in place.  I thus would have accepted that the evidence shows that H will be at a grave risk and thus I would have found that this defence was established.  </span></p>
