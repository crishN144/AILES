	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case gives rise to the vexed question of how the court should, when exercising its powers to award ancillary relief, reflect, if at all, the property that the husband (&#8220;H&#8221;) bought to the marriage back in 1993.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a not very big money case. It is agreed that the assets in this case amount to about &#163;9.714m in value. It is not disputed by the wife (&#8220;W&#8221;) that when they married H was a rich man. In her evidence she told me:</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in">I thought he was pretty rich. He used to say he was very rich. His uncle called him a yuppie. He would say &#8220;I am much richer than a yuppie; it is insulting to call me a yuppie&#8221;.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence demonstrates that H had assets worth &#163;2.116m at the time of the marriage in 1993. Merely to adjust by inflation would up-rate that figure to &#163;3.4m today. If one were to allow for a measure of passive growth using, say the FTSE100 index, or 3.75% compound interest, then the figure becomes &#163;4.2m. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H does not ask that all of the value of his pre-marital property be reflected in the result, let alone all of the value of that property up-rated by growth.  His proposal is that W should receive &#163;4.17m out of the &#163;9.714m, or 43%. This would leave H with &#163;5.544m, or &#163;1.374m more than W. Thus it can be seen that H seeks reflection of 65 pence in the pound of his actual pre-marital property, or 33 pence in the pound of the up-rated value. H says that his proposal meets the justice of the case, and that the sum of &#163;4.17m will meet W&#8217;s reasonable needs.</p>

First and foremost she says that half of &#163;9.714m, or &#163;4.857m is in fact barely enough to meet her reasonable needs.

		    <p class="Quote" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in">[Pre-marital property] represents a contribution made to the welfare of the family by one of the parties to the marriage. The judge should take it into account. He should decide how important it is in the particular case. The nature and value of the property, and the time when and circumstances in which the property was acquired, are among the relevant matters to be considered. However, in the ordinary course, this factor can be expected to carry little weight, if any, in a case where the claimant&#8217;s financial needs cannot be met without recourse to this property.&#160; </p>

This will normally determine the way in which the discretion is exercised, and thus ensure some measure of uniformity of decision. From time to time the considerations may change as public policy changes, and so the pattern of decision may change: this is all part of the evolutionary process.&#8221;</p>

The answer might well have been that it applies only to matrimonial property, namely the property of the parties generated during the marriage otherwise than by external donation; and the consequence would have been that non-matrimonial property would have fallen for redistribution by reference only to one of the two other principles of need and compensation to which we refer in para&#160;[68], below.

Application of the sharing principle is inherently arbitrary; such is, I suggest, a fact which we should accept and by which we should cease to be disconcerted. Mr Pointer's approach seems particularly by-and-large. But is the greater apparent specificity of Miss Stone's approach an illusion? Powerful voices are raised against the accuracy of the types of valuation which her approach often requires. For example in <span style="font-style:italic">H v.

We may infer that Moylan J would have preferred in the first instance to adopt Mr Pointer's approach and, at most, only to test the suggested result against application of Miss Stone's approach. The exercises, on the one hand, of adopting A and of testing against B and, on the other, of adopting B and of testing against A may indeed have subtly different consequences. At all events in this case, particularly in circumstances in which a central valuation mandated by it has been crystallised by sale, I prefer in the first instance to adopt Miss Stone's approach.  </p>

My view of overall fairness to both parties, developed at an early stage and not displaced in the course of protracted subsequent reflection, is that an award of 40% to the wife, for which Mr Pointer contends, would be unfair to the husband and that the bracket fair to both would be between 30% and 36%.

Had the husband been incapacitated in the course of the marriage, so that he was incapable of earning his living, this might well have justified, in the interests of fairness, not holding him to the full rigours of the ante-nuptial agreement. But this was far from the case. On the evidence he is extremely able, and has added to his qualifications by pursuing a D&#160;Phil in biotechnology. Furthermore, the generous relief given to cater for the needs of the two daughters will indirectly provide in large measure for the needs of the husband, until the younger daughter reaches the age of&#160;22. Finally, the Court of Appeal did not upset the judge&#8217;s order that the wife should fund the discharge of debts of &#163;700,000 owed by the husband, only a small part of which she had challenged.</p>

This showed family expenditure of $800,000 with income to put towards it (including investment income) of only $350,000. Plainly since 2007 the family has been running a large deficit. Both parties accept that after this case is over they will have to retrench significantly.</p>

Of this &#163;197,000 is in their &#8220;son&#8217;s account&#8221;, which was opened a long time ago in 1999. Since then regular contributions were made to it which were recorded on the parties&#8217; joint US tax return.  It is now agreed that the funds will be used to meet their son&#8217;s school fees and US university fees (it being overwhelmingly likely that he will go to university in the USA). Much (far too much) criticism was made of H for not mentioning this fund in his Form E and for suggesting that the school fees should be divided equally. H&#8217;s reason for not mentioning it was that he thought at the time that the fund was earmarked for university fees. As a default this was trivial but it was used as a forensic weapon with which to assail H in order to try to paint a picture of him as an unfair litigator. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Quite apart from the fact that these sums are de minimis in the context of the case I roundly reject W&#8217;s criticisms. In this country we have separate property. If a party disposes of assets with the intention of defeating the other party&#8217;s claim then such a transaction can be reversed under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>. Similarly, where there is &#8220;clear evidence of dissipation (in which there is a wanton element)&#8221; then the dissipated sums can be added back or re-attributed (see <span style="font-style:italic">Vaughan v Vaughan</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 1108" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 1108</ref> at para 14). But short of this a party can do what he wants with his money. What is not acceptable is a faint criticism falling short of either of these standards. If a party seeks a set-aside or a re-attribution then she must nail her colours to the mast.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">W&#8217;s second criticism only emerged in her s25 affidavit dated 7 February 2011, one month before the commencement of this case. The affidavits were in fact supposed to be exchanged, by virtue of an order of the court, on 7 January 2011, but the parties made a private agreement to extend the time for doing so. Given that the court has a duty proactively to manage these cases I doubt that it is proper for parties to alter court fixed time limits without reference to the court. The consequence of the delay was that H only saw W&#8217;s case about his allegedly eschewed earning capacity very late in the day. He did not bother to meet that case in writing before he stepped into the witness box, where he convincingly demonstrated that all of W&#8217;s allegations were either misunderstood, or were hopelessly stale, or were insubstantial.   </p>

	  <num>42.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reject W&#8217;s case in this regard for a number of reasons. First, if it is alleged that a party is not exploiting an earning capacity, then it is incumbent to prove that by clear evidence rather than by anecdotal scraps. I would have expected evidence from an employment consultant demonstrating that H did indeed have and has a substantial earning capacity in the financial sector since 2007. One can speculate why such evidence was not forthcoming. Maybe H&#8217;s age and the arrival of the global financial crisis had something to do with it. Second, Mr Amos QC asserted that if I were to find against W on this ground that would not in fact affect her claim to a 50% entitlement under the sharing (as opposed to the needs) principle. It was no more than a reinforcement to his central argument. I wondered therefore why it was being advanced at all. Third, the evidence relied on by W was, as I have said, no more than anecdotal scraps, which H convincingly demonstrated were either misunderstood, or were hopelessly stale, or were insubstantial. Fourth, even if W had been able to show that H had indeed eschewed a high earning capacity I find it impossible to criticise him for moving into another more happy and fulfilling field at the age of 55, even if rather lower paid. By ordinary standards H is well paid as a school-master. I do not attribute to him any higher earning capacity than that which he presently earns, and I certainly do not criticise him at all for having failed to earn more since leaving banking in 2007. Equally, I do not attribute any earning capacity to W for the purposes of my calculations. It may be just possible for each to earn more (for example by H doing some kind of financial consultancy work in the school holidays) but if they do then the income derived must be regarded as a bonus. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having dealt with these aspects of W&#8217;s case, I now turn to my conclusion as to how the assets should be divided. My first conclusion is that a sum of &#163;240,000 should be taken off the top to constitute a fund for the daughter&#8217;s education. The parties are agreed that such a sum will likely cover all or most of her education to the end of her first degree. It would put her on an equal footing with their son, and makes very good sense where there are only finite sums in hand. This leaves &#163;9,474,000 as the divisible amount.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I conclude that it would be wrong and unfair for none of H&#8217;s pre-marital wealth to be excluded from the sharing principle. It was the bedrock on which this marriage was founded. As against that are the undoubted facts that the marriage was long and the monies were well and truly mingled with marital funds, signifying an acceptance by H that to a great extent the monies, or at least their growth or earnings,  would be shared with (or to use the words of the marriage service &#8220;endowed on&#8221;) W. I have concluded that &#163;1,000,000 should be excluded. This satisfies the justice of the sharing principle, and as I will show below, the residual sum will meet W&#8217;s needs. Any greater excluded sum would not permit W&#8217;s needs to be reasonably met. But for this factor, I would have excluded more. If W&#8217;s needs suddenly had come to be met or had disappeared by virtue of an unexpected event, such as a windfall, remarriage to a rich man, or death (as happened in <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Smith (Smith And Others Intervening)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 2 FLR 432" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 2 FLR 432</ref>) then I would have excluded &#163;2.116m being the actual value of H&#8217;s pre-marital wealth, for the same reasons as I stated in <span style="font-style:italic">FZ v SZ</span>.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Jones </span>the overall percentage granted to the wife was 32% after a 12 year childless marriage (see para 52).

Her housing capital need was stated to be &#163;4,947,411. Her budget, excluding child expenses, was stated to be &#163;176,000, but this did not include medical insurance of &#163;11,250, giving an adjusted budget of &#163;187,000. This would require a Duxbury fund (excluding the datum of UK state pension) of &#163;4,734,355. Thus W&#8217;s claimed needs were &#163;9,681,766, rather more than the totality of the assets possessed by the parties. W never put forward an alternative needs case tailored to her claim for half of the assets. Her case had an unreal air about it.  I have therefore had to do my best in the absence of any helpful evidence from W.</p>

This is most unsatisfactory and it is baffling given the massive expenditure on costs why such a casual approach to an important feature of the case should be adopted. That said, W accepts that she will have to cut her coat according to her cloth. Having considered the matter carefully I agree with Mr Dyer QC that based on his particulars an all-in housing fund of &#163;1.75m is appropriate. This would enable a very comfortable and reasonable home to be bought in either W10 or W6, but probably not in W11 or W2, where prices per square foot are appreciably higher.  </p>

Again, ignoring the datum of the state pension, as this will not be available to these US parties, she will from that fund have an annual income of &#163;104,000. In my judgment she can live comfortably on that.
