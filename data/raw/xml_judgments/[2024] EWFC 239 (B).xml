It consists of     23 pages and has been signed and dated by the judge. The Judge has given permission for the judgment (and any of the facts and matters contained in it) to be published on condition that in any report, no person other than the advocates or the solicitors instructing them (and other persons identified by name in the judgment itself) may be identified by name, current address or location [including school or work place]. In particular the anonymity of the children and the adult members of their family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that these conditions are strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court. For the avoidance of doubt, the strict prohibition on publishing the names and current addresses of the parties and the child will continue to apply where that information has been obtained by using the contents of this judgment to discover information already in the public domain.</span></p>

The Guardian also recommends some orders about the parents sharing important information about the children with each other and making decisions as their parents together wherever possible.  The Guardian was very clear that there is no safeguarding risk to the children from them seeing F, and if the children don&#8217;t have a relationship with their father, this creates a risk to their welfare and that risk is likely to result in very significant and long-term problems for them.  </span></p>

At the time of this incident A and B would have been very young, potentially too young to fully understand what happened, but they were present in the house at the time of the incident.  Both M and F also agree that they had been arguing before this incident and that M had been trying to film F during the incident.  While M and F were arguing with each other, it seems they agree that they were not focused on B who had earlier been hurt playing on a bike.  It is not clear how much of this incident A and B remember but I have taken judicial notice of the fact that, as research shows, an incident of this type would have been harmful for them even if they were not directly present and even if they had no clear memory of it or clear understanding of it because of their age.</span></p>

They are 16 and 15 as I have noted, and their views to professionals have been largely consistent in that they do not want to spend time with F now.  Their reasons for this have been different at times, but the key themes they have referred to are F&#8217;s anger when he lived with them, and B in particular has referred to being angry at F for leaving them and to being told things by M or A which on any view should not have been shared with him (for example M telling him about the incident in 2013 and B being told about the incident with A when F lost his temper in June 2023, which F disputes).  Both A and B are clearly very angry with F and suspicious that he has not changed and therefore remains likely to lose his temper with them, A referring in particular to the incident in June last year when F became frustrated and shouted at him (page 389).  However, A also talked about being angry with F for &#8216;cheating&#8217; on M and knew about this because of what A was told by M (page 389), and Pilar Cubelos noted that A gave her a variety of reasons for not wanting to see F and did not rate the incident in June last year very highly when asked to rate the reasons for not seeing F.  A gave &#8216;cheating&#8217; and calling A &#8216;disabled&#8217; as the highest rated reasons for not wanting to see F.  As I noted earlier, F does not accept that he called A &#8216;disabled&#8217;, but the evidence from A to professionals seems clear that this is what A believes F said and, since F accepts he became frustrated and lost his temper, it is likely that his recollection is also not reliable.  On balance I am satisfied that he must have said something that A interpreted as being called disabled and that is now what A believes F said.</span></p>

Despite this, it is clear on the evidence before me that A does not want to see F at present and wants F to respect A&#8217;s wishes and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;color:initial">&#8220;back off a lot&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial"> (page 418).

Clearly A and B are both older teenagers and that means greater weight should normally be given to their wishes and feelings than would be the case for younger children.  However, their understanding has in my view been considerably impacted by prolonged exposure to parental conflict in this case.  I am satisfied on the evidence before me that both parents have failed to protect A and B from their adult conflict, and this includes F losing his temper and assaulting M in the past as well as M sharing inappropriate information with A and B during these proceedings. It also includes the parents&#8217; refusal to communicate directly with each other, another form of demonstrating ongoing conflict as William Walker noted (page 328).  As a result, neither A nor B have a properly balanced and objective viewpoint informing their wishes and feelings about spending time with their father.  This will also not be helped by the negative view of F that M has expressed to various professionals and during her evidence to me.</span></p>

The reasons for A and B not wanting to see F is not just because of what M has done.  The evidence in this case is not that simple.  Both M and F have admitted doing things that will have influenced what A and B now think about seeing F as I noted earlier.  Equally, as the Guardian&#8217;s evidence shows, some aspects of what M has done, for example showing A and B the photos of her injuries from 2013, not doing enough to encourage them to see F, and sharing her negative views of F, are not child-focused and show her not actively supporting and encouraging the children to have a relationship with their father.  However, F has also had a long history of failing to manage his temper and exposing A and B directly and indirectly to this, and both M and F have failed to stop A and B from being exposed to their adult conflict.  All of this will have undoubtedly contributed to the views that A and B have about not seeing F.</span></p>

Both A and B have an emotional need to have an understanding of and relationship with F, as well as potentially their wider paternal family.  The professional evidence is very clear that if they don&#8217;t have this then they are at risk of harm, as Michael Nwoye reiterated to me in his oral evidence.  The professional evidence is clear that knowing about their father and paternal heritage is an important part of understanding who they are, where they come from, and it will not benefit them to completely sever their relationship with him. William Walker described a potential for B to have </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;color:initial">&#8220;a lasting hole in [B&#8217;s] identify as [B] becomes an adult&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial"> (page 327) if B is allowed to carry on life without F being involved.  A has additional physical, emotional and educational needs arising from the injury, and the medical evidence also supports a conclusion that the parental conflict in this case has negatively impacted on A&#8217;s welfare whilst trying to recover.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial">The likely impact on A and B of any change in circumstances is the next relevant heading.  I am not asked to make any changes about A being in country C, A&#8217;s medical care or education.  Similarly I am not asked to make any changes to B going to school here.  It is submitted by Ms Murray KC for M that if I make the order that the Guardian and F want, specifying that A and B should live with both M and F, but it being up to them to choose when they live with F, this will be a change in circumstances.  On balance, I am not persuaded that this would be a change in circumstances within the ordinary meaning of the phrase in the Children Act.  Each parent has parental responsibility for A and B and the proposed order would not change this, unlike in the case of a parent who doesn&#8217;t have parental responsibility but may acquire it if a child arrangements order directing that a child will live with them is made.  Before these proceedings and during them A and B could choose to live with either or both of their parents.  At the moment they are choosing to live with M and not to live with F or spend time with him.  The proposed order is subject to the wishes and feelings of A and B so they would still, as now, be the ones choosing when they live with F and that would include whether they live with F at all.  The only change as a result of the proposed order would potentially be the message that it sends to A and B about the need to have a relationship with both of their parents, and that their parents both need to help support A and B with this.</span></p>

I have already noted their ages, but would also note that, as the Guardian put in his written evidence and F told me, it is incredibly difficult to get children of this age to do anything that they don&#8217;t want to do.  Obviously both A and B would benefit from having a relationship with their father in terms of their own identity needs and I have already noted that.  Similarly, their background is inextricably linked to both of their parents.  A also has additional challenges arising from the injury including issues around working memory, impulsivity and physical mobility.  I have also noted the anger that both A and B have clearly expressed to professionals in this case, often using very extreme language.  Learning to manage that anger appropriately is going to be important for each of them considering F&#8217;s history of failing to do that.  As the Guardian noted in his final report at page 420, A also needs to focus on rehabilitation without the weight of the ongoing issues between F and M.</span></p>

As is clear from all the professional evidence before me, A and B have both suffered harm from the failure of both of their parents to protect them from adult conflict.  They have also suffered harm from F&#8217;s anger and that includes the impact of this on them directly and indirectly.   It is also clear from the evidence of William Walker and the Guardian that A and B are also at risk of harm through not having a relationship with their father.  The Guardian described that F and M were </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;color:initial">&#8220;consumed by their own needs and have demonstrated limited insight into the harm that they continue to indirectly perpetrate to A through their ongoing actions&#8221; (page 420).  </span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial">He also described M as having placed both A and B in a difficult position because she says that she will support them having contact with F if they want (something she repeated in evidence to me), but M has also shared inappropriate information with them and accepts that her negative views about F may have &#8216;bled&#8217; into the children&#8217;s feelings about F as well.  My conclusion is that M may say that she will do what the children want but has created a situation where A and B may well feel awkward about asking her, therefore making it less likely that they would tell her if they wanted to see F in future.  This is no doubt partly why both William Walker and the Guardian have provided evidence pointing out that M needs to move to actively encouraging and supporting A and B to want to see F.  It was very striking in M&#8217;s evidence to me that she was completely unable to describe how she might do that, perhaps not helped by the fact that she has yet to complete the recommended work.</span></p>

M and F are no longer together as a couple and A and B are now of an age where, as the Guardian told me, they are less likely to be afraid of F losing his temper because they can protect themselves.  Equally, there is clear evidence from both William Walker and the Guardian to show that A and B are at risk of harm if they continue to be exposed to their parents being unable to resolve matters in a co-operative and child-focused manner.  As William Walker said </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;color:initial">&#8220;It is understandable that M has reservations and fears about engaging with F due to his past behaviours and that F may be reluctant to communicate with M for fear of his words or tone being used against him.  F and M must find a way to present in a way that shows they want the best for their children.  This can only be done by supporting each other&#8217;s relationship with their children, such as showing up together at essential meetings regarding the children and encouraging and supporting their children to communicate any stated difficulties with the other parent.  Communicating with each other can be difficult, but it doesn&#8217;t always have to be.  The ability to work together is at the heart of a healthy co-parenting relationship and produces positive outcomes for children&#8221; (page 361).  </span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:initial">This is also important, as he noted at page 360, because of what M and F are teaching A and B about how to handle disagreements, which may have profound implications for A and B&#8217;s ability to have healthy adult relationships in future.</span></p>

However, the Guardian gave me clear and compelling oral evidence that he is not saying that A and B must be forced to spend time with or live with F against their wishes and feelings.  His evidence was that these children need to know that not only do their parents share legal parental responsibility for them, but they are also equally responsible for them in reality and neither parent has priority over making decisions that affect A and B.  He also told me that the wishes and feelings of the children would be what decides when and how they might choose to live with F, and that it may take considerable time before they might be at the point where this was possible so F would have to be patient.  M would also have to do more to actively support and encourage A and B to want to spend time with F.  The Guardian was also clear that he was confident that if the order was made and explained to A and B by him in the right way, and not misrepresented to them by anyone, then they would not be angry and upset.</span></p>

Historically the concerns about the latter have related to M and she is the one that has to improve this, but it is important that F must also continue to promote A and B&#8217;s relationship with M if and when they start to spend time with him again.</span></p>

F will have to continue to be patient and to show M, A and B that he is being patient and continuing to build on the progress that he has already made in completing the recommended work.  M needs to prioritise undertaking the work that has been recommended for her and to start as soon as possible to actively support and encourage A and B to want to spend time with F.  I appreciate that M actively supporting and encouraging A and B to want to spend time with F may not be popular with A or B, but a good enough parent doesn&#8217;t do things to remain popular with their children, they do what is in the welfare interests of the children.  This includes not sharing inappropriate information with A and B in future.</span></p>
