	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">First of all, can I express my gratitude to all counsel for the skill with which they have presented the arguments this morning on the points raised.  The hearing today was set up in accordance with an order which I made in fact as long ago as March 2017, for me to consider and ultimately to determine the claimants&#8217; application for damages under the Human Rights Act and whether I should approve the potential settlement of a claim.  I gave specific directions in relation to that back on 2 March 2017 and that order was supplemented - indeed, in some respects, replaced - by orders made on 13 April, and 19 June.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should make it clear that I never contemplated - nor is it apparent from any of the orders I have made to which I refer - that I would at this hearing be deciding whether the statutory charge, to which I will refer a little later in this short judgment, would apply to the award of damages which the claimants sought under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>.  By order of 2 March, I had made it clear that the Legal Aid Agency&#8217;s contribution was to &#8220;make any representations about its funding of the claim&#8221;.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">That all said by way of introduction, I have been pleased this morning to approve the settlement of the two claims of the claimants under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> and I have separately, following on from that approval, made a directions order which effectively adjourns the investment hearing to a Master to determine the matter at the beginning of next term, as soon as a date can be located, with specific directions that the father is to replace the Official Solicitor as the Litigation Friend for the two claimants.</p>

Mr Butler, on behalf of the claimants, advised me that as a ballpark approximately one half of the work undertaken on behalf of the claimants by the legal team since 19 July, the date on which the indication of the acceptance of the settlement was given, has been caused by the failure to which he has referred.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The position of the Legal Aid Agency in this case was set out initially in a position statement helpfully provided on their behalf and drafted by Mr Birdling, who ably represents them today, dated 4 April 2017.  He set out in that document the Legal Aid Agency&#8217;s understanding of the relevant facts and set out the funding position and the application of the statutory charge, reproducing in para.4 of his document the relevant provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/10/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref>.  After a brief discussion and analysis, he says this at para.8:</p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;In the circumstances of this case, the Legal Aid Agency considers that the Human Rights Act damages would be &#8216;property recovered by the individual in proceedings or in any compromise or settlement of the dispute in connection with which the services were provided&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">For reasons which I do not need to develop, the hearing in fact which I had timetabled for mid-April did not take place.  I then made separate orders to which I have earlier referred, 13 April and 19 June, for the filing of documents by the claimant and the defendant, and gave the Legal Aid Agency and indeed CAFCASS the opportunity to make further representations.  In para.17 of the document prepared for this hearing by the claimants, erroneously dated 19 September but I think in fact truly dated 19 July, they say this:</p>

No decision on the application of the statutory charge to the settlement sum has yet been taken by the Legal Aid Agency.  If an adverse decision is taken, the correct procedure for challenging it is by a claim for judicial review &#8230;&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The provision of the skeleton argument in accordance with my direction coincided with exchanges of correspondence between Leigh Day, the solicitors instructed on behalf of the Official Solicitor for the claimants, and the Legal Aid Agency.  I have been taken through that correspondence this morning.  It is again probably unhelpful and unnecessary for me to reproduce it in full, but I make reference to one or two of the key items of correspondence, starting with the letter of 13 June 2017 from Leigh Day to Mr Barry Scott of the Legal Aid Agency.  In that letter, Miss Moore, the solicitor at Leigh Day with conduct of the case, specifically drew to the attention of Mr Scott at the Legal Aid Agency the judgment of Mr Justice Keehan in <span style="font-style:italic">H v Northamptonshire County Council</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/282" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 282 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 282 (Fam)</ref>, (hereafter the <span style="font-style:italic">Northamptonshire</span> case), in which the judge had made clear that, in this type of case, well in advance of the final hearing of the Human Rights Act claim, the Legal Aid Agency should be invited to make a decision on whether it asserts that the statutory charge will be applicable to any award of Human Rights Act damages.  Miss Moore expressly invited the Legal Aid Agency to make a decision in the case at that time and explained in the letters not only the basis on which the claim was brought under the Human Rights Act and why it was different from, as she asserted, the care proceedings, but also why it would have a direct implication for the claimants. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">That letter was responded to by the Legal Aid Agency in an email dated 22 June in which Mr Rymer, senior lawyer for the central legal team of the Legal Aid Agency, indicated that the Legal Aid Agency had already set out their position in their written submissions to which I have earlier referred &#8220;&#8230; so you are aware of the Legal Aid Agency&#8217;s position&#8221;; but, says Mr Rymer, &#8220;[y]ou have raised some new points and so I should be grateful if you could let me have until 7 July to respond&#8221;.</p>

That was responded to by Mr Rymer two days later in these terms:</p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;I am going to be meeting Barry later to see what he has got so that I don&#8217;t ask you to send me material that the Legal Aid Agency already has&#8221;.</p>

Accordingly, in a sense, she (Miss Moore) put on hold any intention to send documents to the Legal Aid Agency although, on 21 July, chased it up by a request: &#8220;Do you need any further documents from me?&#8221;  Mr. Rymer replied, 21 July, in these terms:</p>

Instead, on 11 August, the Legal Aid Agency submitted a further skeleton argument or written representation.  That is in my bundle.  That is again prepared by Mr Birdling.  In that further representation, he says this:</p>

It appears from correspondence received from the claimants&#8217; solicitors subsequent to that date that its understanding of the relevant background may have been incomplete.  At the conclusion of these proceedings, the Legal Aid Agency will consider the operation of the statutory charge in light of that correspondence, the final outcome of the case and the material which has been disclosed to it&#8221;.</p>

I have had specific regard to Part 44 and Part 46(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998.  Specifically in Part 46(2) and the power of the court to make orders for costs against third parties, I have had regard further to the decision of <span style="font-style:italic">Globe Equities v Globe Legal Services Ltd</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/1999/3023" uk:canonical="[1999] EWCA Civ 3023" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] EWCA Civ 3023</ref>, in which Lord Justice Morritt said at para.21 as follows:</p>

First, to para.58 and Mr Justice Keehan&#8217;s recognition and confirmation that the court has power to make third party costs orders in the circumstances, a point about which I have no hesitation in agreeing with.  Secondly, para.93, that the court should exercise that discretion where the third party has increased costs unnecessarily and/or unreasonably.  Thirdly, in a passage which for its full import should be read essentially from para.81 through to 91, that there is no reason why the Legal Aid Agency should not make a decision before the conclusion of Human Rights Act litigation, particularly where the Human Rights Act claim has been compromised and the factual matrix of the claim is agreed and settled &#8211; see paras.85, 87 and 88 in particular.</p>

More than once in this type of case have judges had cause to express their concern - I among them - about the injustice that is effected by the incidence of the statutory charge on damages awarded to claimants in cases which arise largely as a result of, or in association with, facts which have founded the basis of making Part IV <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> applications and possibly orders.  However, it was in my judgment unreasonable for the Legal Aid Agency not swiftly to put itself into a situation where it could - and, in my judgment, should - have made a decision about the statutory charge and its application in this case when, first, it arguably had all the relevant documentation in July or thereabouts, as Mr Rymer makes clear in his correspondence to Miss Moore.</p>

Thirdly, it was being reminded in correspondence on a number of occasions about the implications of the <span style="font-style:italic">Northamptonshire</span> case.  Specifically, I refer to the correspondence of 13 June, 2 August, 8 August and 25 August.

In the circumstances it would, applying the discretion which is open to me under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/51" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.51</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1981 Act</ref> and the Civil Procedure Rules 1998, only be just that I determine that the Legal Aid Agency should pay those additional or increased costs.</p>
