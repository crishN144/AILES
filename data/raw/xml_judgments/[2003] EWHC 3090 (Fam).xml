	    <p class="p19" style="margin-left:0.51in"><span style="font-size:10pt">This case had the potential for a grave miscarriage of justice and wrongly breaking up a family, perhaps forever. On 21 October 2003 I gave permission to a local authority to withdraw their application for care orders, which had the effect that all legal proceedings came to an end. What follows is not a judgment in the conventional sense, for I did not hear any oral evidence, did not hear any disputed arguments, and have not had to rule or adjudicate upon anything (save to discharge the court&#8217;s own duty when granting permission to withdraw). Rather, the purpose of this &#8220;judgment&#8221; is to draw the attention of courts and the legal and medical professions to the history of this case, for the lessons which may possibly be learned from it.</span></p>

The examination was performed by a specialist registrar in paediatrics, Dr Paula Drummond, under the supervision of a consultant paediatrician and senior lecturer in paediatric forensic medicine, Dr C de San Lazaro, who was also present. Dr Drummond&#8217;s report dated 22 December 2000 said that:</span></p>

		    <p class="p22" style="margin-left:1.49in"><span style="font-size:10pt">T had engaged extremely well with general physical examination and been completely undistressed by this. However, she then had a bizarre outburst of crying when we first opened her legs to look at her perineum and although she became extremely distressed, screaming, she did not actually try to move away or close her legs. As the examination progressed she relaxed and allowed full examination but remained very quite and tearful. Examination of her hymen showed a dilated orifice after initial spasm and inability to relax. The hymen was redundant but opened out fully in the end. There was a deep transection notch at 7 o&#8217;clock and the hymenal orifice was approximately 0.6cm.</span></p>

These findings along with the comment from T are extremely concerning and therefore this young child with poor verbal skills should be considered significantly at risk.&#8221;</span></p>

		    <p class="p22" style="margin-left:1.49in"><span style="font-size:10pt">Genital inspection was of considerable interest. As had been suggested in two previous examinations, by Dr Rollison and Dr Curtis, the transection to the right hymen appeared to have significantly healed and this part of the hymen had fused. There was a small amount of altered vascularity around this area, as a remnant of what had been present before. However, the tissues above that area of the hymen had become thickened and notched and there was what appeared to be a disruption and an area of healing allied to the opposite side of hymen at around the 5 o&#8217;clock position. There was marked hypervascularity around all the tissues, which looked somewhat inflamed, although externally there did not appear to be any inflammation of the skin.</span></p>

As the genitalia are not centrally placed in the frame of the photograph it is difficult to tell if there has been an equal amount of traction exerted on each genital lip and therefore caution should be exercised in interpreting any findings. The hymen is annular. There is some oestrogenisation of the hymen (which would be expected at this age) and there would appear to be more hymenal tissue on the left than the right of the hymen. There is a deep defect or notch in the hymen at 7 o&#8217;clock. It is difficult to be sure if this goes across the full width of the hymen to its base (a transection). The vaginal walls can be seen. There is no evidence of any recent injury, nor of any discharge.&#8221;</span></p>

The irregularities to the hymenal rim at 7 and 9 o&#8217;clock are consistent with an old healed nick or small tear of the hymen but not a full width transection.

Doctors Evans, Drummond, Rollison and Sunderland all gave evidence. Dr Evans and Dr Sunderland adhered to their opinion that the photographs of 15 December 2000 and 15 February 2002 all revealed evidence of trauma, both prior to 15 December 2000 and again prior to 15 February 2002. Dr Sunderland advanced the hypothesis, with which Dr Evans (who was recalled) agreed, that T had a sleeve-type hymen. This explained why in the February 2002 photographs there was no continuing sign of the abnormality in the 7 o&#8217;clock area.</span></p>

I would further draw the court&#8217;s attention that my previous reports have been based on examination of the previous photographs and diagrams. My clinical examination together with the 11 June 2003 photographs explains to me my previous difficulty in reconciling the evidence in this case.

There needs to be much more open discussion between paediatricians and gynaecologists in cases of alleged female sex abuse and there will be continuing discussion between forensic examiners, paediatricians, gynaecologists and other doctors regarding this sensitive and difficult area.</span></p>

I agree that these findings alone provide no evidence of abuse. The question is whether these findings are consistent with the previous findings, ie whether this could represent healing. The question is whether, if there was a deep notch at 7 o&#8217;clock in December 2000, that notch could heal so as to be no longer noticeable. In reality, very little is known about hymenal healing.</span></p>

If there is a deep transection extending to the base or even near to the base of the hymen that defect would persist unless it is surgically repaired &#8230; There is no medical possibility that edges of a hymen that have healed from acute trauma would spontaneously regenerate and grow back together&#8221;. If the final examination [viz in June 2003] was normal &#8220;the hymen was always normal. Mistakes are made in the examination of pre-adolescent girls, particularly those who are this young. Mistakes are made because an examiner hurries and is reluctant to put girls in the prone, knee-chest position when they are so apparently certain of the findings&#8221;.</span></p>

But they rightly recognised that the reports of those statements alone could not, in the light of the final state of the medical evidence, justify a finding that T had ever been sexually abused by the father or, indeed, by anyone. So all parties joined in asking me to permit the local authority to withdraw their applications for care orders so all proceedings came to an end. I was, however, invited by all parties to summarise the history and the medical evidence.</span></p>

So far as possible, I have deliberately quoted the words of the doctors themselves and not summarised or paraphrased them in language of my own. I wish to make it quite clear that I do not make, nor wish to imply, any criticism of any doctor individually. Clearly, however, the story is a very serious one. The consequences for this family have been grave and might have been even more grave. For two and a half years from December 2000 until the joint report of Doctors Sunderland and Evans on 16 June 2003 all the expanding medical evidence was to the effect that T had definitely been sexually abused, with penetration, prior to December 2000 and probably again prior to February 2002. All four doctors who gave evidence to His Honour Judge Wood gave evidence to this effect, and (although she did not give evidence) the reports of the fifth doctor, Dr San Lazaro, were to the same effect.</span></p>

I cannot imagine that the proceedings have not had an emotional impact on the children despite their apparent confidence. &#8230; The children have been harmed by virtue of the disruption to their family life&#8221;. I agree with the further comment of the guardian that &#8220;It is a devastating and sobering thought that had another physical examination not been carried out by Dr Sunderland and Dr Evans, the outcome to this case may have been very different&#8221;.</span></p>

My attention was drawn to the &#8220;Guidance on paediatric forensic examination in relation to possible child sexual abuse&#8221; produced by The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and The Association of Police Surgeons in April 2002. In several places that Guidance implies reliance for second or expert opinions upon still or video photographs obtained by colposcope (see under the headings Joint Examination; Colposcopy and photo-documentation; and Statements/Reports). I do not presume to say that the Guidance necessarily needs to be revised. But it does respectfully seem to me that those bodies need to consider whether, in the light of the experience of this case, any parts of the Guidance should be revised.</span></p>

There is much force in the comment by Dr Sunderland in his letter of 10 July 2003 that &#8220;The implications for good practice in child protection include the need to treat colposcope photographs with caution and the need for the courts to appreciate intimate examinations may have to be repeated&#8221;.</span></p>
