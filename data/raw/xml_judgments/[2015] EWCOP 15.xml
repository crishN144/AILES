	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 28 November 2014 P suffered a major cardiac arrest.  There was a period of 25 minutes between his arrest and spontaneous circulation.  As a result he sustained severe hypoxic brain injury which is considered by the doctors to be severe and irreversible.  Since that time he has remained totally dependent on intensive care.  Medical opinion suggests that he is unlikely ever to recover any level of consciousness.  The second respondent representing P&#8217;s family disagrees strongly with the medical opinion.  The Trust therefore applied to the Court for a declaration in P&#8217;s best interests firstly, not to escalate his care and secondly to discontinue some care, inevitably leading to his demise.  Therefore the question is of the utmost and crucial private and public importance leading to the Health Trust making an application on 20 January 2015.  At the same time they also applied for a reporting restriction order with accompanying documentation.  When they sought to serve that material on the Press Association through the service known as CopyDirect, but now in fact called the Injunctions Alert Service, the second respondent objected to the disclosure of any identity either of P or of P&#8217;s family.  That objection was maintained at the first hearing on 22 January 2015.  </p>

Mr Patel on behalf of the Authority, Mr Sachdeva QC on behalf of the second respondent and Ms Dolan on behalf of the Official Solicitor.  I have also heard, as previously indicated, very helpfully from Mr Dodd of the Press Association, his submissions being made specifically on behalf of the Times Newspapers, Trinity Mirror, Independent Print Ltd, Evening Standard Ltd, Associated Newspapers, Guardian News and Media and the Telegraph Media Group.  I have also read a submission in an email from the Guardian Newspaper which I take into account.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the conclusion of the hearing Mr Sachdeva, who raises and argues this point, asked for time to consider the submissions of the Authority and the Official Solicitor (who were in agreement).  I carefully timetabled submissions in order to provide time for the preparation of this judgment.  A Joint Note from the Trust and Official Solicitor was received in accordance with the Court Order.  Nothing was received, nor was there any communication from Mr Sachdeva by way of apology, or even as to whether something was likely to be received, until chased on my behalf by my clerk.  Mr Sachdeva&#8217;s lamentably late short supplementary document was not received until 5 March, by which time it must have been obvious that the outline of this judgment had already been completed and the time available to the Court had been lost.  As a result the hearing listed has had to be vacated and relisted at no little inconvenience to everyone else in the case.</p>

The Court has been vested with significant powers to assist those who, for whatever reason, lack the capacity to make decisions themselves. The background to the new legislative structure arose from the need to address the interests of those individuals who did not fall within the ambit of successive Mental Health Acts. The Family Division of the High Court gradually developed structures appropriate to provide the protection necessary to meet those needs. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The 2005 Act</ref> replaces this jurisprudence by introducing a self contained legislative structure, largely based on the practices of the Family Division where judges dealt with welfare matters. The matters historically dealt with by the Office of the Supreme Court (under the name of the Court of Protection) involved property and financial affairs. The two jurisdictions dealing with both welfare and property and financial affairs are now vested in one court: the Court of Protection.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">The jurisdiction is regulated exclusively in accordance with the new Act. The result is that the affairs of those who are incapacitated for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> are examined before a judge in court. The affairs of those who are not incapacitated are, of course, decided and handled privately, usually at home, sometimes with, but usually without confidential professional advice. None of these decisions is the business of anyone other than the individual or individuals who are making them. And that, as we emphasise, represents an entirely simple, and we suggest self-evident aspect of personal autonomy. The responsibility of the Court of Protection arises just because the reduced capacity of the individual requires interference with his or her personal autonomy.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">The new statutory structure starts with the assumption that just as the conduct of their lives by adults with the necessary mental capacity is their own affair, so too the conduct of the affairs of those adults who are incapacitated is private business. Hearings before the Court of Protection should therefore be held in private unless there is good reason why they should not. In other words, the new statutory arrangements mirror and rearticulate one longstanding common law exception to the principle that justice must be done in open court.&#8221;</p>

There is no express obligation (there being no contract between the applicant and the subscriber) and whilst the subscribers receive the material for the purpose of deciding whether to oppose an application, it is difficult to identify any sound basis that there is an intention to create legal relations between them, especially given disclosure is made pursuant to the requirements of PD13A.</p>

The relationship, no doubt founded in the philosophy of anxiety and concern for privacy of children derived from many years of practice in the Family Courts has led to difficulties.  As a result, in September 2006 the Family Division introduced a check list which counsel making applications was required to complete, to demonstrate to the Court that media notifications had been made with the correct documentation.  That had followed complaints through the Injunctions Alert Service that applicants were frequently withholding documents and details, e.g. the names of parties, which made it impossible for them to make sensible and properly informed decisions, and subsequent submissions about whether they wished to challenge the imposition of such restrictions.  </p>

Service of notification by this method has been accepted by the Courts and the media as meeting the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>.  The benefits for the Court are that it is reasonable to assume that media who may wish to oppose an application or argue a particular restriction will be able to do so once they have received notification of an application.  Therefore once an order has been made and assuming there is no major change in circumstances the Court should be able to assume that the issues of reporting restrictions and publicity have been dealt with properly at the start of the case and will not subsequently suddenly surface at various stages during the proceedings.  An additional benefit, it is submitted, is that if the media should decide to make representations, they may well be able through discussion and exchange before or through the hearing to narrow the issues that go before the Court (see here also the example which occurred during the currency of the case heard by Baker J in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">W</span> v <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">M</span> (supra) where an appropriate accommodation was reached and approved by the Court).</p>

I, like Baker J, consider that that is undoubtedly because it is frequently unhelpful to serve a full draft on the media because, as often happens, the detailed terms of the order are often changed and adapted significantly during the course of a hearing.  However, in the absence of any such requirement, it must be incumbent on the applicant to indicate clearly in the application and in the submissions the burden of the order being sought.  Notice of course should indicate the categories of persons (if there are many, as for example with health professionals) whose identity would be kept confidential under the proposed order, if the applicant wishes to apply for an order restraining the media from communicating with those persons.  </p>

The exercise of parallel analysis requires the court to examine the justification for interfering with each right and the issue of proportionality is to be considered in respect of each.  It is not a mechanical exercise to be decided upon the basis of rival generalities.  An intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary before the ultimate balancing test in terms of proportionality is carried out.  Having so stated Lord Steyn strongly emphasised the interest in open justice as a factor to be accorded great weight in both parallel analysis and the ultimate balancing test.&#8221;</p>

It also suggests that the assumption is being made that the applicant&#8217;s right to privacy under Article 8 of the ECHR outweighs the media and public&#8217;s rights under Article 10.  That approach by lawyers representing applicants seeking reporting restrictions or injunctions in refusing to identify the parties involved in a case involves restricting the media&#8217;s rights even before the Court has had an opportunity to consider the matter.  That, it is said, leaves the media unable to take advice or make sensible and informed decisions as to what approach, if any, to take in a particular case.  </p>

Any lacuna may be covered by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/97" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 97</ref>, or alternatively there is no Court of Protection equivalent to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/97" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 97</ref>.  With respect to Mr Sachdeva I consider that the analogy with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/97" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 97</ref> of the Children Act may not necessarily be a good one having regard to sections 8(3), 8(4) and 10(1)  as well as <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/97/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 97(2)</ref> and the word &#8220;possible&#8221; should be given its ordinary meaning.  It should be remembered too that wardship is a different animal, created in an entirely paternalistic age which would be unthinkable under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> today.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The questions therefore seem to be as follows.  On the one hand the arguments in favour of revealing the parties&#8217; identity to the Press before such an order is made include Practice Direction 13A requiring that the application notice (COP 9) be served with the media notification.  The COP 9 has the parties&#8217; names on it as of course does the witness statement (COP24).  It is in accordance with open justice to allow the media fully to consider whether to object.  It is pragmatic, otherwise the media would have to attend every case to learn the parties&#8217; identity.  Arguably no harm is done by notification because the media cannot report the parties&#8217; identity despite no RRO being yet in place without being in contempt and the media will learn the parties&#8217; names once the RRO is made in any event.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Against the proposition is the assertion that the Practice Direction (which is a practice direction, not a Rule of Court) does not require the draft order to be served on the media (as noted by Baker J in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re M</span>).  However, he was considering the issue in relation to the identities of a considerable number of people who would be covered by the anonymity order.  More directly than that it is simply unnecessary for the media to know the identity of P before forming an opinion on the terms of the RRO being sought, the issues being the centre of interest.  Relevance is also placed on the absence of prohibitive order prior to hearing, a breach of which it is said is not clearly a breach of confidence or contempt of court.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, it seems to me that there are a number of factors which come decisively together.  Firstly, that the Practice Direction is inclusive, it covers the service of COP 9 and COP 24, it is silent as to the removal of the identities of the parties.  Rule 17 of the Practice Direction appears to be predicated on the basis that there may be exceptional circumstances or circumstances in which some information, either an entire document or part of it, would be withheld until adjudicated upon by the Court.  That seems to me to suggest that the norm would be that the information <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">is</span> given to the Press.  Ultimately I am impressed by the arguments, two of which were stressed by Mr Dodd.  The first is that the Court should work on the basis that just because it may hypothetically be that one rogue editor or subscriber takes a different view that the fact that one individual in the sector abuses or could abuse his position does not mean that that freedom is lost by all members of the Press.</p>

In our view, broadcasting authorities and newspaper editors should be trusted to fulfil their responsibilities accurately to inform the public of court proceedings, and to exercise sensible judgment about the publication of comment which may interfere with the administration of justice. They have access to the best legal advice; they have their own personal judgments to make. The risk of being in contempt of court for damaging the interests of justice is not one which any responsible editor would wish to take. In itself that is an important safeguard, and it should not be overlooked simply because there are occasions when there is widespread and ill-judged publicity in some parts of the media.&#8221;</p>
