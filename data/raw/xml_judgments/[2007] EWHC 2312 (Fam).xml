	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment concerns 7 year old C who was born on 25 August 2000.  The issue is whether he should continue to live with this mother, 36 year old Miss K T in DeV, or return to London and live with his father, 39 year old Mr J V W.  The mother has represented herself; the father has been represented by Miss Parker QC.  The hearing took place on 16, 17, 19 July and 27 July 2007.  It was an anxious hearing for everyone.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the separation there were a series of disputes.  Since 2004 mediation has been used.  Both parents lived in London for some 2 years prior to December 2006.  The mother then announced without notice that she, C, her second husband Mr M, and their son T (then 7 months old), were moving from London to DeV.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father applied to court to prevent the move.  If he did not succeed in that, he wanted C to finish the school year in London.  A child psychiatrist, Dr Berelowitz, reported.  There was a two-day hearing before me in April 2007.  C spent the summer term at school in DeV.  His contact with his father increased to five days a fortnight by June 2007 with school holidays being shared.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother has never accepted his position as a father.  She has denigrated him, his family, and his home to C.  Their relationship has been harmed as a result.  She has failed to implement changes to improve this despite clear warnings.  She lacks insight, remains uncooperative, accepts no blame, but rather blames other people.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The whole move to DeV and her conduct since then has been aimed at reducing his role in C&#8217;s life.  This is so against his best interests that only a move to his father now can ensure their relationship prospers.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Only if the court is satisfied that the mother is committed to promoting and expanding C&#8217;s relationship with the father should he remain with her.  There is no sufficient evidence of that.  A last chance for the mother merely delays his return to his father in London.  If he does stay, the mother will feel vindicated, and consider there is no need for change.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Historically her view was that the father wanted to exercise control, he was inflexible, and his solicitors wrote aggressive letters over the slightest thing.  She has defended herself and her family from the father&#8217;s accusations.  She accepts that she has made mistakes.  She should have involved the father in the decision to move out of London.  She did not think that allowing C to call Mr M &#8220;Dad&#8221; mattered despite Dr Berelowitz&#8217;s warnings in April.  It was only when she discussed with him in detail on 7 July that she understood.  She now accepts the points that he makes on this and other topics.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She has never encouraged C to denigrate his father.  There was the strife in her home because of the pressure of father&#8217;s attitude, the flow of letters and e-mails, and court applications to which she did not respond well.  That may well account for C&#8217;s negative remarks about this father.</p>

They discuss the time he spends with his father, he is doing well at school, and he enjoys his friends and in particular, his half brother.  It would be contrary to his best interests to move him back to his father&#8217;s house in central London now she understands what was wrong in the past.  He would be very unhappy at the change.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the 8 days between the third and the final day of the hearing, I read all the daily transcripts and a great deal of the background statements and reports.  In announcing my decision, I pointed to the improvements in contact that had been achieved since April as the father accepted.  He lacked confidence that it could be sustained.  His alternative for C to live with him in London was viable but it would cause much upset.  Contact arrangements with the mother would not be easy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I could not say that the changes which the mother had made, though very late, were just for the court to hear, as the father believes.  They were fuller than might have been expected.  They justified not moving C at this stage, but their timing meant a review was needed when Dr Berelowitz&#8217;s further opinion would be available.  I invited the parties to enter agreements about therapy.  It was for the mother to demonstrate what she said she had learned in the very stressful, expensive and wearing process of the hearing.</p>

The mother, Mr M, and the maternal grandmother Mrs T had agreed to take part in therapy.  The parents were going to work on a parenting plan.  A further one day was to be listed in December 2007.</p>

In particular I refer to the reports and evidence of Dr Berelowitz which is now accepted by both parties.  Finally I shall expand on the reasons for my decision.  This exercise will I hope help the parties to understand what has now to be achieved and the possible consequences if that does not happen.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Between January 2001 and September 2004 the father was working in Germany.  His commitment to C is amply shown by the fact that he commuted back to London at weekends and midweek to see him.  In October 2001 he issued an application for contact. There was a consent order in July 2002.  The father saw C midweek and on a half day at weekends.  From January 2003 this was extended to all day at the weekend.  Between August 2002 and September 2003 the mother was out of the jurisdiction with C for over three months.  The reasons have not been explored.</p>

A home had been found and C enrolled at a local school which he had visited in November.  She gave more details four days later, when she criticised the father for leaving C in the house on his own.  She informed the police.  The father accepted that he had wrongfully left him on two occasions for a short time.</p>

It is difficult to see this other than a demonstration of the mother&#8217;s view of the second class role that the father had in matters relating to C.  It is no answer that the father now sees more of C than he did before.  It understandably confirmed the father&#8217;s worst fears and led to these series of court hearings.</p>

Action is required now which would allow C to continue with his father in London, and attend his former school.</p>

They started by her complaints that the father has used his wealth unnecessarily to oppress her by frequent communication and court proceedings without an appreciation of the strain on her and her financial difficulties.  He has been unreasonable.  His care of C can be rightly criticised, whether it is frightening him, pursuing her on skiing holidays, irresponsibility in his day-to-day care, or failing to keep her informed of his plans and actions in which C is involved.  Though there is some substance in the latter complaints, the father has had to resort to solicitors and the court to achieve proper contact.</p>

I accept that this caused her to change.  Her final submission is impressive.  Refreshingly it does not criticise the father in any major way (see para 50).  It does criticise his solicitors for the volume of documents, sending transcripts to DeV when she was in London, and the tone of the final submissions.</p>

It was to C&#8217;s detriment.  It is sadly a not uncommon result of a breakdown in a relationship.  It is not often that it is so graphically pointed out as in this case.  Courts are slow to change residence in such circumstances without giving the resident parent a chance to understand what has gone wrong and to remedy it, provided such a course is compatible with a child&#8217;s best interests.  The changes in the mother&#8217;s attitude justify such a course in C&#8217;s best interests.</p>
