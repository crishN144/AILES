The second respondent&#8217;s position is that FX does not have capacity to make decisions as to his residence, care and finances at this time. It is not argued by any party that he lacks capacity in respect of contact. There is no dispute that FX lacks capacity to litigate these proceedings.</span></p>

This is a rare genetically determined disorder apparent at birth that is associated with particular physical and behavioural characteristics. These include developmental delay and likely mild intellectual disabilities, relative deficits in growth and sex hormones and in early childhood the emergence of a marked propensity to overeat (hyperphagia) that can result in life-threatening obesity if access to food is not controlled. There may also be an increased propensity to other behavioural difficulties including temper outbursts, repetitive and ritualistic behaviours, and skin picking.</span></p>

He has a history of placement breakdowns, problematic behaviours and safeguarding concerns with respect to his family. FX is overweight and has health problems such as skin complaints, type II diabetes, oedema and sleep apnoea which are very likely related to him being overweight. FX is relatively independent in many areas of his life. He is able to self-medicate, mobilise independently and perform personal care tasks. However, he is unable to control his compulsion to constantly eat and the majority of his care is focussed on this. Unlike many people with PWS he does not have particular routines or rituals and skin picking is not a severe problem.</span></p>

Unfortunately, home care packages have broken down. He still visits and maintains a strong relationship with his family. When these proceedings were commenced FX resided at Care Home A. FX wished to move from there to Care Home B &#8211; a placement where he had previously resided. A lack of clarity about plans for FX&#8217;s future prompted this application. Ultimately Care Home B was not an available option. During these proceedings, on 28</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt"> February 2017, FX moved to Care Home C a residential placement where he is settled and where he states he wishes to remain.</span></p>

He felt unable to comment about FX&#8217;s capacity to make decisions about contact with others as this is very dependent on circumstances. He concluded that in respect of residence &#8220;on the balance of probabilities at the time I saw him, he lacked the capacity to make this decision for himself. He was not able to give coherent reasons for wishing to live where he is or to balance and weigh the various options.&#8221; With respect to decisions about care he could not determine whether FX recognised the risks of over-eating and FX was unwilling to reflect upon his future care needs. He concluded that as he did not understand and could not weigh and balance the relevant factors FX lacks capacity to make decisions about his care and treatment now and probably in the future. He concluded that FX has capacity to manage modest amounts of his day-to-day money as agreed with the support staff in his care plan. However, he does not have a sufficient understanding to plan and budget, to have the capacity to fully manage all of his financial affairs.   </span></p>

In her oral evidence she said that she believes that FX &#8220;knows what we are talking about but won&#8217;t say it&#8221;. He told her that in respect of his PWS he had commented more with her than other professionals. He acknowledged that he used to overeat but says &#8220;I don&#8217;t do that anymore&#8220;. She believes that FX acknowledges what it means to have PWS and links things to it but does not say it. He said that he was not happy at Care Home A and needed more support there because he was not happy. At Care Home C he is happier, he wants support in the kitchen and actively seeks staff out. </span></p>

He likes staying at his mum&#8217;s and he is happy at Care Home C. He said that the other place (Care Home D) is too far away. He likes being in Care Home C as it is close to his mum and he knows people there. He described the staff as helping him when he goes out, staying with him whilst he makes his breakfast, helping him at lunchtime and making his dinner. He described Care Home D as &#8220;it&#8217;s for my PWS&#8221;. He refused to discuss his PWS but he did say that PWS is an eating disorder and that he was born with it. He was able to explain that when he goes out he has to make sure he has taken his tablets for diabetes. He said that he sometimes becomes frustrated with the staff when he is out &#8220;sometimes they ask me to buy diet drinks or fruit instead of crisps and I get fed up sometimes. I don&#8217;t like that but I am trying to lose weight and they are helping me that&#8217;s why they do it&#8221;. He also explained that he does not wear his sleep apnoea mask &#8211; &#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you say I&#8217;m not wearing it! If I lose weight that will help me so I&#8217;m not wearing it! Don&#8217;t talk to me about it!&#8221;. He understood that the cost of living at Care Home C is met by the NHS and Social Services.</span></p>

He talked to her about Care Home D and his worry that it was far from his mum&#8217;s, that he would not be able to travel there, that he knows the current bus route and area but wouldn&#8217;t know the one from Care Home D. He also said that he has built relationships at Care Home C which he relies upon to calm him down and which he did not want to lose. He fears that if he moved he&#8217;d be unhappy and this would affect his behaviour. He said that he had not been happy at Care Home A and that had affected him. It affected his weight as he had pushed boundaries for example with respect to meals and in the kitchen because he didn&#8217;t get on with the staff.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt">There are other reasons to be cautious about the opinion of Professor Holland. In his evidence he demonstrated an obvious knowledge of PWS and great commitment to improving the lives of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, this seems to have led Professor Holland to conflate best interests with capacity. He acknowledged that with respect to understanding of relevant information he had set the bar quite high and linked this to the consequences of uncontrolled symptoms of PWS upon sufferers and the benefits to them of a tightly controlled regime particularly with respect to food security. In addition, he failed to conduct a proper analysis of the presumption of capacity. In his analysis the burden was shifted to FX to demonstrate that he possesses capacity. He was unable to provide a satisfactory answer to Mr O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s question &#8220;what did FX say to lead you to the conclusion that he lacked capacity having regard to the test under section 3?&#8221; He did not consider whether any of FX&#8217;s reported actions were unwise decisions rather than indications of lack of capacity. </span></p>

Professor Holland&#8217;s evidence has been relied upon to support the second respondent&#8217;s assertions of lack of capacity. In his oral evidence Professor Holland was clear that FX has the capacity to decide between two environments, as that is a more &#8220;concrete&#8221; decision and one where he could decide which he prefers. However, where all options are open, in his opinion FX cannot incorporate in to his thinking an understanding of his PWS and then he does not have capacity.

I conclude on the balance of probability that he would not. However, it is very likely that he would be able to form a view between two possible options both of which had food security&#8221;.</span></p>

Following LBL v RYJ a decision is not to be made by P in general or in abstract. On the basis that Professor Holland is satisfied that FX has capacity to decide between two options it must follow, as matter of logic, that he has capacity to make decisions about the place where he currently resides.</span></p>

She has different qualifications to those of Professor Holland and her assessment was not ordered for the purposes of these proceedings. However, she had the advantage of being able to meet more extensively with FX and was able to have more productive discussions with him. She conducted her assessment from the correct starting point of presuming that FX has capacity and applying the relevant statutory framework and guidelines. </span></p>
