	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case has been before five judges in the urgent applications list of the Family Division of the High Court.  In general, this list is before a different judge each week.  On the first four occasions it was heard without notice to the Respondent.  The proceedings were brought by the Applicant in reliance upon the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref>) and the Hague Convention.  The Applicant was seeking an order for the return of the child of the parties to the United States.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, and before the proceedings were issued, the application came before an experienced circuit judge sitting as a High Court Judge who made a location order.  Since then I am the fifth judge of the Division who has dealt with the case.  When the matter first came on before me, the Applicant was still seeking to pursue his application under the Hague Convention and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref> for an order for the return of the parties&#8217; child to the United States.  However, after the short adjournment, his counsel informed me that he was instructed to withdraw or seek a dismissal of that application, with the result that the only live issues relate to costs.  At that stage, no application for a wasted costs order had been made against the Applicant&#8217;s solicitors, but the possibility of one being made had been raised in correspondence, and in submission. Such an application was made over the adjournment of the hearing with the result that I now have to deal with applications made by the Respondent for costs against the Applicant and for a wasted costs order against the Applicant&#8217;s solicitors.  These applications are resisted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A location order was granted and continued in this case.  It is one of a number of orders directed to the Tipstaff, the Respondents and other people served with them.  Other such orders are Collection orders and Passport orders.  Standard forms of such orders exist but they can be tailored to meet individual cases.  They are served by the Tipstaff or, at his request and instruction, by the police.  They can result in service by the police at residential addresses at any time of day or night, or by police at ports.  They confer a power of arrest if a person served does not, in the view of the Tipstaff or the police, obey the order (e.g. as to handing over travel documents or providing information concerning the whereabouts of a child).  They also provide for a port alert to be entered at the instance of the Tipstaff. As the names indicate, a location order is primarily directed to finding a child and then keeping that child in the jurisdiction, a passport order is primarily directed to obtaining travel documents and keeping children in the jurisdiction, and a collection order is primarily directed to finding and handing over a child.  As is common, the location order in this case contained (a) an order that all passports of the child and the Respondent were to be handed over, (b) injunctive relief preventing an application being made for a passport for the child or the Respondent and (c) injunctive relief preventing the removal of the child from England and Wales and a change being made to the place where the child was living at the time the order is served.  The location order did not include an injunction preventing the Respondent from leaving England and Wales (which can sometimes be included) but the practical effect of her having to hand over her passport (and, probably the injunction relating to the child, if she was with her) meant that the location order provided that the Respondent could not leave England and Wales.</p>

They enable public authorities to interfere in the private lives of adults and children and carry serious penalties.  It should be known to all judges who grant them that experience has shown that:</p>

In that case, Theis J refers to and cites from two decisions of Munby J (as he then was) and one decision of mine.  The case related to a child and involved the making of a passport order.  It confirms the need for caution, care, rigour  and close scrutiny in respect of applications for and the grant of Tipstaff orders on a without notice basis. Theis J sets out the principles and procedures at paragraphs 13 to 16 of her judgment.  I cite them in full because in my view they should be considered and applied by every applicant for, and every judge dealing with, an application for without notice relief in the Family Division and this is particularly so if that relief involves the grant of a Tipstaff order.

In my view this can lead (and experience as the applications judge confirms that it does lead) to practitioners making without notice applications which are not necessary or appropriate, or which are not properly supported by appropriate evidence. Also there is in my view a general practice of asking the court to grant without notice orders over a fairly extended period with express permission to apply to vary or discharge on an inappropriately long period of notice (often 48 hours). It seems to me that on occasions this practice pays insufficient regard to the interests of both the persons in respect of whom and against whom the orders are made, and that therefore on every occasion without notice relief is sought and granted the choice of the return date and the provisions as to permission to apply should be addressed with care by both the applicants and the court. Factors in that consideration will be an estimation of the effect on the person against whom the order is made of service of the order and how that is to be carried out. </span><br/><br/><span style="font-size:10pt">38. Inevitably on a without notice application the court hears from only the applicant.

As to that I accept and acknowledge that a reference to notice being given if practicable, or for a short period of notice (say 2 working hours or just two hours if a week end or holiday period is imminent), may often provide an appropriate balance to avoid a sequence of effectively without notice applications, and that in some cases a longer period of notice may be appropriate, and</span><br/><br/><span style="font-size:10pt">iv) in many cases an account of the steps the applicant proposes concerning service, the giving of an explanation of the order and the implementation of an order.

I appreciate that in many instances there is a very real urgency and there will not be third party evidence of allegations of abusive behaviour that are readily available but in others there will be. A classic example, which occurs regularly, is that an applicant who seeks a return of children to his or her care fails to provide any third party evidence (e.g. from a school, a GP or records in their possession) to confirm that he or she is indeed the primary carer of the relevant children. </span><br/><br/><span style="font-size:10pt">40.

Naturally I endorse that guidance and do not seek to add to it save to emphasise the points made above and to record my own observations that practitioners (a) too regularly do not follow and implement that guidance, and (b) by such failure show an insufficient appreciation of the exceptional nature of without notice relief and the impact it has (or potentially has) on the rights, life and emotions of the persons against whom it is granted. </span><br/><br/><span style="font-size:10pt">42. As to this I acknowledge that the courts must take part of the blame for such failures by granting relief without notice in cases when (a) the guidance has not been followed, and (b) the impact on the person against whom the relief is granted could be considerable. </span><br/><br/><span style="font-size:10pt">43. I add that additionally there is a need (a) to comply strictly with undertakings given at the time the order is made, and (b) to keep full and proper records of what is put before the court and said to the court. This should include a record of the times of the hearing so that a transcript can be more easily obtained. The availability of a transcript does not however reduce the duty of those applying for without notice relief to keep a full record of what the court was shown and was told. </span></p>

To my mind, this regular and flagrant failure by many practitioners and judges is contrary to the public interest.  I, and some of the other judges of the Division, try to bring about necessary and much needed changes when dealing with without notice applications (particularly in the Applications Court).  But sadly, this case is a clear demonstration that we have not succeeded and that a number of our colleagues do not take the same approach.  So the serious failings are endemic amongst many family practitioners and judges who have been family practitioners.</p>

But this temptation, and the strong public interest in granting such relief, does not provide an excuse for failures to apply the correct approach in law to such applications.  Indeed, if anything, the strong public interest in providing such relief and its impact on the subjects of the relief and their families mean that the correct approach in law should be followed and so the sound reasons for it, based on fairness, should be observed.  Naturally this applies to all without notice applications, but it can be said to have particular importance when Tipstaff orders are sought and granted because they can found a deprivation of liberty without further court involvement, and they do restrict freedom of movement.</p>

They met in Pakistan and were married there in 2006.  After their marriage, they lived in the United States but separated before the birth of their child in August 2007.  Their divorce was finalised in the United States on 15 September 2008.  Orders were made by the American court that gave "legal and physical custody" of the child to the mother and permitted "visitation" to the father as set out in the order.  The order also provided that the parties were to: "provide the other with forty five (45) written days notice to the other party of their intent to remove<span style="font-weight:bold"/>the minor child from the United States; without providing such notice neither party may remove the minor child from the United States&#8221;.</p>

She also asserts that this had been discussed between them and that before the child left the United States she had advice from a lawyer who told her that he could see nothing that would prevent her from removing the child from the country.  There is some correspondence relating to this between the parties; in it the father asks a number of questions.

He then sought and obtained leave for alternative service from the American court and served his application pursuant to that order by post to an address in Pakistan in September 2009.  On 5 October 2009, the American court ordered that the original contact order was to be "modified" so as to award custody to the father and found the mother to be in contempt.  Also, it revoked the father's financial obligations to the mother and the mother was ordered to pay US$5000 towards the father's legal fees.  On a date which is unclear from the papers, the mother sought to have this order set aside: this application was rejected in September 2010.  Also at some point (again the date is unclear on the papers) the mother was indicted by a Grand Jury for "felony parental abduction" and assistance was then sought from the Department of Justice for the extradition of the mother to the United States to stand trial.</p>

Indeed, a location order is normally (if not inevitably) made on the basis of there being a risk of flight if the Respondent is notified of court proceedings.  It is this that generally justifies it being made without notice.  </p>

It came before a High Court Judge of the Family Division.  The mother had not been located in this country and had not been served by fax or email.  On that occasion, two further disclosure orders were sought and counsel for the father, through a position statement and submission, informed the court that:</p>

That, it transpires, is not a formal restaurant but a far more informal restaurant.  My Lord, the information about that came from a Facebook entry that my client managed to obtain indicating that the mother was at this address.  So what we propose to do is take a chance and just ask the Tipstaff to send the police to that address.  If the mother is there then fine.  It may well be that there will be third-party individuals there who will give sufficient answers to the police to avoid arrest and who will then tip the mother off.  But on obtaining instructions, we propose to take that risk. </span> &#8221;</p>

My Lady, may have seen historically, or may not have seen, that what happened was that he got wind from a friend who saw a Facebook entry that the mother had travelled from Pakistan to England and was attending at a restaurant and at an address in Coventry.  He had two potential addresses.  The Tipstaff attended both addresses and could not find the mother.  They made various enquiries but no arrests were made, and so they were satisfied that no one was hiding or concealing information about the mother or the child's whereabouts.</span></p>

But it is common ground that if it did the mother did not get them.  Also, the potential addresses visited by the Tipstaff were not identified, but it seems that one of them may have been the informal restaurant.  In those circumstances, Counsel sought and was granted a three-week adjournment, that being the maximum time permitted under the rules, and indicated that it may very well be that in three weeks time the father would have no alternative but to invite the court to dismiss his application.  This echoed the father's position, through counsel, at the hearing on 9 November 2011.</p>

This applies to (a) the reference to &#8220;military sources&#8221; and an unidentified Facebook entry concerning the restaurant &#8211; which the court was told was not a formal restaurant, and later to (b) the assertion that the father had been told by an unidentified friend of the Facebook entry and that he had two potential addresses &#8211; which were not identified, but one may be the informal restaurant.  It is also the case, that this trail of confusing information would only have been available in part to the succession of judges because some of it was imparted by oral submission, rather than the updating position statements (which I will assume were in the court bundle).  The updating should have been set out in evidence with an explanation of its impact on the beliefs set out in the witness statement of the father&#8217;s solicitor.</p>

This falls short of the description of the belief asserted in the witness statement and does not accord with the possible inference therein that the child was one of the family eating in the restaurant.  So, it provides another reason why in this case updating investigation and evidence was warranted to put the position as it was known and believed to be from time to time, together with relevant sources of information, fully and frankly before the court.</p>

Also, there is no additional information about the relevant sister and where she is studying.  In this context, the father would know how many sisters the mother has and, as the marriage was arranged, there is surely a real prospect that his family might know where that sister was studying.  Indeed, in his statement prepared for this application the father&#8217;s solicitor says that he had been informed by his client that the wife&#8217;s sister was at Warwick University (which was correct) but I have found no mention of this earlier.

So it would have provided (a) proper details of the relevant sources of the information that founded the asserted belief that she had been here, and (b) a properly particularised account of the reasons for a belief that the child would be likely to return with her mother having regard to updating information, and any contact there had been with, or information that had been obtained about, the mother, the child and the maternal family in Pakistan and here.

I reject that ground.  To obtain without notice relief, an applicant should explain why it is necessary and a location order should not be granted unless the court is satisfied that such without notice relief is warranted.  Indeed, as I have indicated earlier, the underlying premise of a without notice Tipstaff order is that his assistance, and so often that of the police, is warranted to locate and serve the Respondent with the intention of preventing further unknown moves of a child and this purpose would be likely to be destroyed if the Respondent was served before the location order was executed.  The common and appropriate practice is therefore not to serve the proceedings or other orders before the Tipstaff order is executed.  To my mind, the undertaking in the order made on 31 October 2011 could and should have been better expressed but should be read as referring to service as soon as practicable after execution or discharge of the location  order.</p>
