	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">26 years ago, on 12 February 1993, two-year-old James Bulger was abducted, brutally tortured and then murdered by two 10-year-old boys, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. It was a crime that, at the time, profoundly shocked the nation and now, all these years later, will still be remembered in detail by many and also, I suspect, will be well known to the generation of those who were not even born at the time. The family of young James Bulger were and are deserving of the greatest sympathy as the indirect victims of this most horrific crime. </p>

They were sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty&#8217;s pleasure. Injunctions were granted at that time to restrain publicity as to their circumstances during the remainder of their childhood. In August 2000 both JV and RT reached the age of 18 years. They applied to extend the anonymity injunction in order to provide protection on into their adult life. That application, which was contested by a number of media agencies, received extensive consideration by the then President of the Family Division, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss. On 8 January 2001, Dame Elizabeth, at the conclusion of a comprehensive judgment [<span style="font-style:italic">Venables v News Group Newspapers Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] Fam 430" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] Fam 430</ref>], granted the application and made a wideranging order, unlimited in time, prohibiting the publication of (in summary): </p>

It was further held that the requirement for proportionality was plainly met as the aim of the injunction was &#8220;to protect the claimants from serious and possibly irreparable harm&#8221;. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 24 February 2010 JV was, indeed, recalled to custody and charged as a result of the discovery of child pornography on his computer. The criminal process, which culminated in proceedings before Bean J (as he then was) at the Central Criminal Court, were originally conducted using the identity that had by then been adopted by JV. The rationale which justified doing so was to avoid the potential for prejudice were his true identity to become known prior to any possible jury trial. In addition, the judge made an order on 21 May 2010 under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49" uk:canonical="1981 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Contempt of Court Act 1981</ref> [&#8216;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49" uk:canonical="1981 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CCA 1981</ref>&#8217;], temporarily prohibiting the reporting of the existence of the prosecution. In the event, on 23 July 2010, following an initial process conducted in open court during which information was given relating to JV&#8217;s current identity and whereabouts at the time of the commission of the offences, JV pleaded guilty to three offences concerning child pornography. Thereafter, understandably, Bean J concluded that it was in the public interest for the original identity of the defendant as &#8216;JV&#8217; to be known. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49" uk:canonical="1981 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CCA 1981</ref> order was discharged, no further reference was made in court to JVs new identity or his whereabouts, but free reporting was permitted of the fact that the defendant in the case was the individual formally known as JV. </p>

On a night out in a pub he was warned by a friend that he must leave immediately as he was going to be stabbed in the toilets. Police concern for his safety led to the installation of a panic button in his home. Since the claimants returned to prison more than 2000 people have joined a Facebook group claiming that Mr. XX is JV. The group&#8217;s members have vowed to track him down and wreak revenge for &#8220;the murder of James Bolger&#8221;.

That fact and the details of those offences can now be (and have been since last Friday) freely reported. But there is no legitimate public interest in knowing his appearance, his location in custody; or the exact location at which he was arrested and to which he might return in the event of being released; or, if there is, it is of marginal significance when set against the compelling evidence of a clear and present danger to his physical safety and indeed his life if these facts are made public. </p>

But now that he has been convicted on his own pleas of guilty entered in the name of JV, there is no reason why his new name should be made public. The effect of doing so would simply be to assist those who seek to track him down. The fact of public interest, as I have already said, is that the man formally known as JV has been convicted. His new name is entirely immaterial. </p>

Further, in the present application Mr. Makin does not challenge the approach described by the President in her judgment and now set out in the submissions of the AG.

In my judgment, the court does have the jurisdiction, in exceptional cases, to extend the protection of confidentiality of information, even to impose restrictions on the press, when not to do so would be likely to lead to serious physical injury, or to the death, of the person seeking that confidentiality, and there is no other way to protect the Applicants other than by seeking relief from the court.&#8221; </p>

In 1993 Moreland J considered that there was a real risk of revenge attacks upon them from others. Lord Woolf CJ in his statement on the tariff in October 2000 confirmed, from the information presented to him on the tariff, that that remained the situation. I heard evidence, in chambers, which supported the conclusion to which Lord Woolf CJ came, that there are solid grounds for concern that, if their identities were revealed on release, there might well be an attack or attacks on the claimants, and that such an attack or attacks might well be murderous.&#8221; </p>

The Supreme Court had evidence that the identity of the individual had been publicised in media outside England and Wales and that a significant number of members of the public in England and Wales were said to know of the celebrity&#8217;s identity.

The publication of the story in newspapers in the United States, Canada, and even in Scotland would not, I think, be sufficient of itself to undermine the claim for a permanent injunction on the ground of privacy. However, the consequential publication of the story on websites, in tweets and other forms of social network, coupled with consequential oral communications, has clearly resulted in many people in England and Wales knowing at least some details of the story, including the identity of PJS, and many others knowing how to get access to the story. There are claims that between 20% and 25% of the population know who PJS is, which, it is fair to say, suggests that at least 75% of the population do not know the identity of PJS, and presumably more than 75% do not know much if anything about the details of the story. However, there comes a point where it is simply unrealistic for a court to stop a story being published in a national paper on the ground to confidentiality, and, on the current state of the evidence, I would, I think, accept that, if one was solely concerned with confidentiality, that point had indeed been passed in this case.&#8221; </p>

Where, as here, the rights to be protected are of a wholly different order and relate to protection from torture and murder, the relevance of some of the confidential material being known to some members of the public (and even assuming for these purposes that the leaked material was indeed true) must be substantially reduced even from the level found in the very different circumstances of <span style="font-style:italic">PJS</span>. </p>

The open source research has been limited to open profiles, and it is believed that private profiles or groups exist with the explicit purpose of sharing views about the subject in a private forum. The content of these groups or the intent of the members is not known but it is likely that some exist for the discussion and escalation of vigilante behaviour. </p>

Whilst the amended injunction proposal does not seek to directly reveal current details of the case and is limited to information not including images, it is highly likely, if not inevitable, that triangulation of geographical and biographical information would reveal his current identity beyond doubt to previous associates and lead to the revelation of recent images and information confirming the identity of the subject on social media. This is at least as wide reaching as the mainstream media but with little scope for censorship or control. Such is the nature of social media, any successful identification of the subject online is highly likely to reach individuals with whom he associates [who] were unaware of his identity and may react adversely when presented with this revelation. This could lead to confirmation of his current or future location and lead to targeted or opportunistic vigilante violence or demonstrations. </p>

Both of the perpetrators were arrested, convicted and sentenced. The sentence is a life sentence. Whilst at times JV may have been at liberty, he has never been entirely free and never will be. He has subsequently been recalled to prison and convicted on two occasions for offences which all right-thinking people will regard as wholly repulsive. On the second occasion the sentencing judge held that JV&#8217;s obsession with pornographic images of very young boys indicated that he was to be regarded as a risk in the future.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The criminal justice system, in the form of the courts, the prison service, the Parole Board and the probation service has a statutory duty to monitor JV and make decisions with regard to the need to protect the public from harm. Decisions as to what should happen to JV as a result of his past offending and, should he offend in the future, any future offending, are matters for the State. Irrespective of what one may think of JV, he, in common with every other citizen, has a right to be protected from serious threats to his life which may arise from individuals seeking to take the law into their own hands. That this is so is a matter, as Bean J held, of the law of England and Wales as much as it is under the law of the ECHR, which is itself part of our domestic law under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>. The purpose of the confidentiality injunctions to protect JV from being unlawfully murdered or seriously assaulted. It is extremely rare for criminals to be protected in such a manner. The question of whether JV should be protected has already been decided in principle in 2001. The question currently before the court is whether the circumstances have changed sufficiently to justify varying the injunction and reducing the level of confidentiality. </p>

As the extract from the judgment of Bean J demonstrates, there has, in the past, been at least one entirely mistaken belief that an individual is JV and that belief was apparently sustained by those who held to it for a period of years.  </p>

Whilst I understand Mr. Makin&#8217;s submission, and for the same reason that the other Supreme Court Justices disagreed with Lord Toulson, I am unable to accept it as, by focusing on only one element in a sophisticated balancing exercise, it does not represent a correct statement of the law. </p>

Secondly, I accept the analysis of Mr. Spurr that the existence of the current injunction has been and remains a critical element in protecting JV. Without the injunction the mainstream press would be free to report accurate details of JVs identity and past whereabouts. He would be likely to be identified. No further injunction or future attempt to change his identity would be likely to regain any significant element of protection. </p>
