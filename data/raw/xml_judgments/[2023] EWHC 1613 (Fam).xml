When the mother was in her mid 20&#8217;s she moved to live in England.  She met the father when she was volunteering in Canada, and they kept in touch. She returned to Canada in 2011 and the parties were married in 2013.  Their daughter was born in 2018.   There were some difficulties in the marriage for which they sought counselling, but things became worse during 2022.  They agreed to travel to England for a period of time to work on their marriage. The father says the agreement was for a period of six months, the mother that it was more open ended. Whilst the parties had had extensive discussions about spending some time in England, when it came to it the final decision was made quite suddenly and possibly at a time of some turmoil after the father confessed that he had had an affair with a colleague.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The mother and child left Canada in early September 2022 with a signed agreement from the father that the consent was for B to be removed for six months (until 1.3.23).  The intention was for the father to come to England as well, and this he did, arriving some two weeks later. At first the mother and B stayed with a friend, with the father staying nearby. In October the mother signed a six month tenancy on a property in the area in which she had lived before she went to live in Canada.  The parents continued to live separately whilst each hoping to save the marriage.  In December the parties sold their home in Canada, with furniture going into storage.  The father lost his job.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">There is a significant dispute between the parents as to what was agreed between them throughout the six months from September to March. The mother says she believed the initial agreement between them was that the stay in England was intended to be open ended, albeit temporary, but that in January the father told her he was happy for her and B to remain permanently and that he intended to stay too.  She said they continued to have discussions along these lines until March and so that when he issued the application for a return order in April she was taken by surprise.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The father, on the other hand says that the agreement was only ever for them to come to this country for six months. The house in Canada was sold but only so that they could buy another in a different area.  He says he never agreed that B could remain here permanently. On the contrary, he said in his statement that he told the mother in December he was concerned she was intending to stay against his wishes, and told her many times thereafter that he wanted B to return to Canada in March.</span></p>

The mother argues that by 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">st</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> March B was habitually resident in England so the Convention does not apply.

She denied that there was a plan to buy a property in a different area to the one they had been in before. In particular, she said that their agreement had been to come for six months or maybe a year (or even permanently), and that she had taken two years&#8217; leave of absence from her job.

His oral evidence often differed in tone and emphasis to what he said in his statements. I do not find that the documents he produced support his case that the topic of a return to Canada was repeatedly discussed by them between January and March in particular, and it is significant that the description in his statement of the contents of the voicemail of 16</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> March to the mother was inaccurate.

The father felt he should put in a return date on the document he signed but this did not mean it was written in stone.   The mother thought that six months would not be enough but the time was fixed mostly around the father&#8217;s leave of absence from his job and his visa. Nonetheless, as the father agreed in his oral evidence, he understood that he and the mother would review what should happen so far as their return was concerned as they went along.

This undoubtedly did lead him to question where his future lay, and that of the family. He said that the discussion revolved around whether he wanted to go back to Canada as opposed to his country of birth but did not agree that the mother and B could remain in England.  I find it very unlikely that the topic of the family remaining in England did not come up in the course of such a conversation as it was very obvious to the father that this is what the mother dearly wanted. I accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that the father did say words to the effect that he would agree to them remaining in England, and also that he looked at jobs both in England and Canada after the discussion in January.  When this was followed by the completion of the sale of the house and the sale of some of the contents this fortified her in her view that they were going to remain in England for the foreseeable future.</span></p>

Although they had spoken of going to England on several occasions in the event there was not much pre-planning at all. The parties were not fully in agreement with the length of time but the discussions they had centred around six months.  B&#8217;s toys, clothes and bedding were brought, but possessions or furniture were not shipped over.  The family home was being sold in Canada but plans to buy another were on hold.  After they arrived the parties initially stayed with friends, and unlike the mother and B, the father never obtained independent accommodation. Neither parent obtained a job in this country and the father never obtained more than a visitor&#8217;s visa.  All these factors point to the temporary nature of the stay here. Of course, it is B&#8217;s situation that I am concerned with, but with such a young child her position is very much dependent on that of the parents.</span></p>

In October 2022 B&#8217;s position became more stable with her move to a rented home with her personal belongings around her and furniture being bought. From all the evidence the move was proving very positive for the mother, which would inevitably have had an effect on B.  In my judgment the early roots put down in the autumn of 2022 became firmer in the new year. The effluxion of time for such a young child and her increasing familiarity with the busy life of activities she was leading would undoubtedly have an effect on her. The mother was clearly very happy to be here, and had re-engaged with friends and the life of the church, a life which very much included B.

In any event, any move back would be to a different home in a different area (albeit not far removed from where they had been before) and a different church community (which for this family is an important part of their lives). The mother would go back to her old job but for B and the father things would be different.  B did not have a school lined up in Canada, although I accept the parties had been looking into this before they left.

Whilst her life here was not completely stable in the sense that the father was much less settled than the mother and there (as I find) there was no clear and unequivocal agreement about the future, she had achieved a sufficient degree of stability and integration into a social and family environment here to put down the necessary roots at the same time as becoming detached from the old ones. I know that five months is not a long period of time, but it is a considerable proportion of B&#8217;s life.   For her it would seem much longer than for an adult.  Even in the absence of any agreement for B to remain here permanently as opposed to temporarily, by late February it seems to me that her home was here. Nursery was going well, she was doing lots of other activities, and she was very much a part of the church community.

Despite my findings about the evidence above, I do not find that the father&#8217;s words and conduct either before or after Christmas 2022 quite reached this particular level.  He was in an emotional state, particularly during the conversation in January 2023 but afterwards too. He wanted to save his marriage and, like the mother, was focussed on that.  He was adamant he wished to live in the same country as B, but without getting a visa he was not guaranteed this and so would not have given his unequivocal agreement.
