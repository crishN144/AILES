He remained an in-patient for a number of weeks.  On 1st of July 2012, and again on 6th of July 2012, blood tests revealed an unexpectedly high level of sodium in A's blood.  The usual cause of such high sodium levels is dehydration and on each occasion it was felt by the medical team that A was showing no clinical signs of dehydration.  The consultant nephrologist was concerned, therefore, that the only alternative cause of the elevated sodium levels was that salt had been administered to A by a third party.  </p>

A decision was rapidly reached that a finding of fact hearing would be required in these proceedings to determine the cause of the hypernatremia.  Pending such a hearing, the mother moved out of the family home, the children having remained at home in the care of the father, assisted by the grandmother.</p>

Mother stated that he had been referred to the orthopaedic team by the orthopaedic team at another hospital.  This was not the case.  A had attended that hospital where the orthopaedic team had suggested some investigations and management and mother had discharged A against medical advice.  A was found to have tender swelling of his left thigh but was otherwise well.  This was felt to be a localised infection and he was commenced on antibiotics.  On the evening of 9th of June he became unwell and had an episode of apnoea. He was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit for further management in the early hours of 10th of June.  He was intubated and ventilated and required medication to help his profusion and blood pressure.  It was felt that this was compatible with serious infection at the septic shock. He went to theatre for further exploration of his left thigh, but no pus was found.  His condition improved and he was extubated on the morning of 13th of June and went back to the ward.</span>"</p>

The nurse looking after him has documented that A had two loose stools that morning.  Although he had a heart rate of 55 beats per minute, he was looking well and eating and drinking.  A junior doctor reviewed him at 12.45 hours and noted that A appeared well; had a BP of 120 over 80, which is slightly elevated, and was warm and well profused.  All this suggests that he had no clinical signs of moderate or severe dehydration.  He was commenced on 0.9% saline and 5% Dextrose, sixty-eight ml per hour, which is more than his calculated for maintenance.  Blood tests were performed because of the low heart rate at 14.00 hours and this showed severe hypernatraemia in a one sixth second. His urea and creatinine were low normal. Although he had further episodes of loose stools, his fluid balance charge showed input at 608 mls and output of 526 mls of urine.  Following the blood results showing severe hypernatraemia he was reviewed by the same junior doctor who, once again, noted that A appeared very well and did not have any signs of dehydration.  The blood test was repeated.  His plasma sodium had improved.  His urine sodium this time was 312 mls.  The fractional excretion of sodium was 1.8 which suggests he was actively trying to excrete salt and not conserve salt as avidly as a child with severe dehydration would be expected to do.  The plasma sodium came back to normal within ten hours of commencing intravenous normal saline and 0.45 saline, a little more than full expected maintenance, which would be unusual for a child with severe hypernatraesion dehydration."</span></p>

There are, undoubtedly, questions as to whether A's admission and continued stay in hospital at this time was in some way caused or contributed to by the actions of his mother. The court has heard no evidence about this and this judgment deals only with the single issue of whether A's hypernatraemia on those two occasions was caused by the mother poisoning A with salt. The mother has not been called to give evidence and I have been invited to decide the issue on the basis of the medical evidence alone.  </p>

Dr Coulthard called this:  "An enormous amount, two or three times the amount you would expect in a boy of this age."  The modest amount of fluids A had had administered via the bolus could not possibly account for it and, said Dr Coulthard, is inconsistent with the same bolus being desperately needed in the body if he had in fact been dehydrated.</p>

This was done in the light of the safeguarding concerns which were held about the mother's actions and behaviour in regard to A.  The notes record the mother being &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">stressed&#8221;</span> and of drawing the curtains around A, despite being asked not to do so.

The following morning A was examined by cardiology and ward doctors.  He was well and stable with only a mild sinus bradycardia.  In the morning and early afternoon he had seven small diarrhoeal stools, amounting to only 300 mls and a single vomit.  His pulse slowed and so a blood test was taken and that revealed his plasma sodium at 167.  Clinically, therefore, A had been well and the diarrhoea and vomiting in the morning, too little and too late to have caused even mild hypernatraemia due to dehydration.  </p>

This, it was agreed by both Dr Coulthard and Dr Fitzpatrick, is not in keeping with severe dehydration when the FE would be generally less than 1% and is consistent with the kidneys actively trying to excrete salt rather than conserve it.</p>

I am satisfied in relation to the first episode, notwithstanding Dr Fitzpatick's anxiety about it, which I judge to be based largely upon her reluctance to rely on the undoubted and unequivocal clinical and recovery picture in the absence of all the chemical data advocated by the guidelines.  I bear in mind that they are guidelines and not mandatory and that whilst I look at each episode separately, I also look at it in the context of the bigger picture, namely the mother's overall behaviour as conceded by her, and by the fact that she, undoubtedly, poisoned A five days later by the same means.</p>
