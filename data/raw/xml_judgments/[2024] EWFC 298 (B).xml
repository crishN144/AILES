Annie has two older full siblings who have recently been adopted and the local authority hopes to facilitate direct contact between Annie and her two adopted siblings once long-term plans are known. Annie also has an older sister who is cared for by the local authority due to her complex health needs. It is hoped Annie may be able to have contact with this sister as well.</p>

The findings made by the court were about their relationship which was characterised by domestic abuse and violence perpetrated by the father towards the mother. In order to give an illustration of it the court made findings identifying four specific dates when assaults took place: November 2019, August 2020, and two after proceedings had been issued, in March 2021 and July 2022 to demonstrate the duration of the violence with no reduction in its severity or likelihood of occurring. The parents were both using illegal drugs whilst caring for the children, the mother tested positive for cannabis use and the father for both cannabis and amphetamine use.  The local authority attempted to manage the risks to the children in the care of their mother by putting in place safety plans which the parents breached. In January 2021 social care staff found the father hiding in the loft at the family home when he should not have been present.  On the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2022, the father was arrested at the mother&#8217;s home following an incident of violence perpetrated by him towards her.  This was a new confidential address where the mother had been placed for her own safety but the court found she had invited him to her property with no regard for the impact the nature of their relationship would be likely to have on their children.</p>

The local authority asserts the mother remains vulnerable and socially isolated without a reliable support network, the emergency contact number given by the mother to the midwifery service in August 2023 is F&#8217;s mother&#8217;s number suggesting she has, by extension, remained in some form of contact with the father. The local authority asserts this increases the likelihood of Annie being brought into contact with the father and the risks he poses to both mother and child. The mother denies F was the father of the pregnancy which she miscarried in January 2024 but the person she names as the father is also an individual known to the local authority to be a person who poses a risk to her safety, and it asserts this highlights her vulnerability to abusive relationships.</p>

At the initial IRH listed on the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2024 the mother applied, very belatedly, for a psychological assessment to update the assessment she had undertaken in the previous proceedings. It was an application opposed by the local authority and the children&#8217;s guardian but granted by this court because it was necessary to evaluate the progress the mother had made in the therapy she had been undertaking since the previous proceedings concluded.

I do not accept the mother&#8217;s explanation for the shift in the dates she put forward when she said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I got mixed up at the time, I was going through a lot with my older children&#8221;</span> because the mother did not file her initial response until February 2024 which gave her ample time to reflect, recall and be truthful. In the context of this case I find it is more likely the mother shifted the dates to fit the evidence. The mother&#8217;s ongoing use is also consistent with her cannabis use in the previous proceedings and her ongoing use of smoking it several times a day which she admitted to the midwife in August. It is consistent with the smell of cannabis in her home when the social worker visited in February 2024.  She did not engage with any substance misuse work thereafter to support any reduction and there is no reasons for her to suddenly just stop as she asserts when she has been using cannabis since she was 17. It is implausible she stopped in August apart from a &#8216;one-off&#8217; episode in October when she indicated in her evidence she uses cannabis to manage her stress levels and these proceedings have been very stressful for her.</p>

However, I have also taken into account that illicit drug use impaired her parenting of the older children and contributed to the neglect of their welfare causing Oliver and Poppy to require a therapeutic level of re-parenting once they were accommodated by the local authority. I am therefore persuaded in this case this is a risk which is likely to lead to the neglect of Annie&#8217;s welfare whilst ever the mother is under the influence of illicit drugs, not least due to her complete lack of support network who could step in and take over the care of the child until she recovered. I find the mother is not being truthful about her cannabis use and I make finding number 2 on the schedule accordingly.</p>

This is supported by the hair strand drug testing for the period start of April &#8211; start of July 2024, and the mother actively denied being in contact with any person who would use it to be able to conclude it was due to passive exposure. The Lextox results do not, in any event, support a conclusion of passive exposure as this would be the less likely explanation for the positive test result.</p>

The mother told Dr Brown she knew she was pregnant by the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2023 but when asked directly by social workers who visited her at home on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2023, she denied it. In her oral evidence the mother accepted this to be correct but deflected and denied responsibility for concealing it by alleging the social worker  &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">was very rude&#8217;</span> to her and that is why she didn&#8217;t tell them.  I find this defensive deflection to be consistent with the psychological assessment of her personality which has been carried out in these proceedings. For three months between the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May and the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2023 the mother did not make any attempt at all to inform the local authority of her pregnancy even though social care were involved in her life with the provision of contact to the older children in this period.

The significance of this is demonstrated in the mother&#8217;s ability to maintain her lies and repeated denial to Ms Main who she accepts she had a positive relationship with, who was supportive of her, and who had given her repeated reassurances the local authority may not remove Annie from her care if she was truthful with them. When asked in cross examination why she did not tell the truth to Ms Main who she liked and trusted, the mother said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I don&#8217;t know, there isn&#8217;t an explanation&#8221;</span>.

As part of the safety plan the mother agreed she would permit unannounced visits to her home by social care staff and if she was not at home, she would answer her phone to enable the social worker to know where she was.  This was important for the local authority to gain an understanding of the mother&#8217;s lifestyle and routines.

Following receipt of Dr Brown&#8217;s assessment Ms Fish was less sure of her recommendation that &#8216;nothing else would do&#8217; for Annie and requested further information and clarity from Dr Brown about time scales.  It led to Dr Brown giving oral evidence.  At the conclusion of his oral evidence, Ms Fish again supported the local authority&#8217;s applications. A summary of her reasons for doing so are set out below. I commend Ms Fish for taking time to pause, reflect and to seek further information when the recommendation she is being asked to make has life-long consequences for a child. By doing so, Ms Fish has fulfilled her independent role to Annie and ensured all avenues have been explored by seeking clarity and not slavishly following the local authority&#8217;s recommendations.</p>

Annie has been with the same carers since she became a &#8216;looked after child&#8217; and her bond and attachment to those carers is growing. She is also having a high level of contact to M and growing an attachment to her. Annie is getting older and starting to walk and talk and she is not with her main care giver who is going to look after her throughout her minority, she has also already had one change in primary care giver from her mother when she left the hospital.  If the change in care happens soon, she will have longer to bond with new carers and they will have longer to bond with her from a much younger age.  That benefits her throughout her life, for them to be able to tell her things from when she was under 2 years old.&#8221;</span></p>

It is agreed the mother has been committed to visiting Annie in hospital throughout her lengthy stay, and to attending a high level of contact four times per week. The guardian agreed, the mother has been dedicated to her visits and shown Annie love and affection. The quality of the time they spend together within the confines of supervised contact is positive.

She is the expected size and weight for her corrected age allowing for her prematurity and is described as a very smiley and happy baby. Annie is slightly behind in her development due to her prematurity, mainly in her gross motor skills, and when the report was prepared she was unable, at 11 months of age, to sit up independently or crawl. There is also some delay in her personal social skills but she is meeting age-related expectations for her fine motor skills and problem solving. Annie has required a nasogastric feeding tube due to her poor weight gain and reflux and is now gaining weight as expected with no vomiting. She requires feeding by this method for 16-18 hours per day with a six-eight hour break. Annie has begun trying small amounts of food and is tolerating this well.

In the current proceedings, a similar pattern is evident, the mother&#8217;s engagement with the local authority is recent, her obtaining of employment is recent, her completion of the CHIME courses is recent.  This does not give time to assess their efficacy or sustainability.  What I do know is that the completion of the domestic abuse course the mother &#8216;successfully&#8217; completed with &#8216;LG&#8217; in the previous proceedings was not put into practice as the mother almost immediately returned to her relationship with F, despite being able to give all of the correct answers the professionals wanted and expected to hear following her attendance on the course. It persuades me Ms Main is likely to be correct when she expressed her concern that putting it into practice is the issue for this mother, and the only reliable indicator of the mother being able to maintain her commitment to change will be by lengthy observation and assessment of her actions. Simple attendance on courses is not going to be enough in this case.</p>

Whilst it is not possible to pinpoint any date, I find it to be more likely she has been in contact with him in some format after that date by drawing inferences from the following: her unwillingness to permit the social worker into her home at the start of the year; her unwillingness to answer her phone to enable the social worker to ascertain her whereabouts, effectively &#8216;hiding&#8217; from the local authority; her positive test results for the use of cannabis and amphetamine which are the two drugs the father is known to use; the mother&#8217;s provision of the paternal grandmother&#8217;s phone number to the midwifery service; the lager cans found in the mother&#8217;s dustbins when she doesn&#8217;t drink alcohol; and the covering of all of the mother&#8217;s windows internally by curtains or blankets which prevented the social worker peering through the window to see who was home. One or two of these features may have given rise to a suspicion but the totality of it tips the balance into finding on the balance of probabilities the mother is not telling the court the truth when she states she has had no contact at all with the father since the night Annie was conceived.</p>

The emotional abuse and trauma which has led the mother to this point in her life has been experienced by her since she was a child, and I agree with the social worker and children&#8217;s guardian that where relationship difficulties have arisen over years of trauma, the initial period of therapy may provide her with a greater understanding of why she needs to be there but it is not going to be sufficient to bring about long term change.  A person really has to understand the need for change and to want to achieve it before it is likely to happen.  I am not persuaded the mother is yet at that point.</p>

In my judgment, the mother will need a lengthy period of assessment to see if she can apply any insight gained in therapy to the creation of healthy relationships. She will need a period of assessment to see if she can achieve and then sustain long term abstinence from any drug use. I consider all of this additional assessment would be essential because currently it is difficult to identify any internal psychological process for this mother to bring about change, it is all being led by external pressure e.g. the court process. </p>

Annie has an emotional connection with her mother and enjoys spending time in contact with her and this will be a loss to her when it comes to an end. The disruption to Annie&#8217;s emotional and psychological attachments to her mother and to her foster carers is going to be a challenge and cause short-term confusion and anxiety for her.  It serves to emphasise the prejudice being caused to her welfare by further delay.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.24in;margin-right:-0.2in;text-indent:0.25in">I also take into account that adoption outside of a child&#8217;s birth family is not always successful and can break down in later years and cause further harm to a child. Fortunately, Annie is sufficiently young to make this outcome unlikely and the positive attachments she has formed to her foster carers are likely to be transferable to adoptive carers to make it a successful adoption. It may take longer to find an adoptive placement for Annie due to her higher than average care needs and there is no guarantee what time-frame that may be achieved within, but I am persuaded it will be achievable. Any adoptive placement which is found for her will only be progressed after a robust and comprehensive assessment of the prospective adopter/s ability to meet her needs and this will minimise the likelihood of any adoptive family placement breaking down. An adoptive placement will keep Annie safe, it will meet her needs, it will provide her with life-long security and be free of the risks she is likely to face in the care of her mother or indeed her father. It may also provide her with a relationship with her older full siblings which will benefit her understanding of her identity.</p>

If she does not make these changes, the risks which Annie is likely to encounter are the same as those which Oliver and Poppy encountered in their mother&#8217;s care. This was not low level harm and neglect but significant emotional harm to their welfare. Their welfare was harmed to the extent one foster placement broke down due to the siblings&#8217; behaviour towards each other and they required therapeutic re-parenting to repair their relationship. The impact upon Oliver and Poppy of the care they received is set out in the judgment from the previous proceedings filed in the court bundle, and Annie must be protected from this harm occurring to her.</p>

This was my conclusion in January 2023 at paragraph 92 of the previous judgment: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Neither parent has sourced or completed the therapeutic interventions recommended by [the previous psychologist] and it is likely this would take a minimum of three months if it started immediately.  There is no evidence it is going to start immediately. I am persuaded the likelihood of the mother resuming a relationship with the father or with another person who may pose a similar risk to the safety of herself or any child in care is likely to continue until she does and/or there is cogent evidence her level of insight has increased.&#8221;</span> Given this is exactly what happened after those proceedings concluded leading to the mother being assaulted yet again by the father, it serves to highlight the risks Annie will face in the care of her mother. </p>
