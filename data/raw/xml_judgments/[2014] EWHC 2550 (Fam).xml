The Local Authority in these proceedings has sought disclosure of the records.  She first became known to Liverpool Social Services in July 2013 in circumstances where it appears the mother sent a text message to a refugee and asylum support staff member stating she had bought a knife and was going to kill herself.  The police attended the mother&#8217;s address and found that the mother and child were safe and well.  According to further information from Liverpool, at that time it appears the mother and child were residing in NAS or SERCO accommodation in Liverpool.  She was said to be open to a Serco worker, and as of 25</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July 2013 it is recorded the mother was in receipt of support and health visiting services in terms of monitoring and offering support.  </span></p>

The mother was refusing to disclose H&#8217;s whereabouts despite several efforts made in late October and early November to locate her.  There is a reference in the chronology prepared by Liverpool for these proceedings that on 30</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2013 &#8220;H is not with her mother and she will not disclose H&#8217;s location&#8221;; they request the police to try and locate the child.  The mother was apparently arrested for obstruction and taken to hospital, but H&#8217;s whereabouts were still unknown. H was reported missing to the police and there is reference to the police making enquiries.  The records indicate they checked the mother&#8217;s phone, she had been down to the south of the country and the child could be anywhere.  It appears in relation to Liverpool&#8217;s involvement the case was closed in January 2014.  From the limited documentation that is available, it appears that H was not seen between the period of late October 2013 and January 2014.</span></p>

The mother was then driven off in a car waiting outside and H was left behind.  T was visited by Social Services and police later that day.  She claimed the mother was somebody who she had only met two times previously and had had no contact with for many months.  She stated that a man had dropped H at her house, not the mother as previously stated.  It appeared to the social worker who attended there were more belongings for H than would have been expected for a baby who had been dropped off only for a couple of days.</span><br/><span style="font-size:14pt">T initially told the police and social worker that she had no contact details for the mother, despite being repeatedly asked for a telephone number. She said she had hardly known her and had only known her briefly through the Albanian community in Brighton.  Due to the lack of clarity about how H came into T&#8217;s care, police used their police protection powers on 20</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> March and H was placed with foster carers, where she has remained.</span></p>

The mother has not been available to the social worker.

The mother and H were known to Liverpool Social Services in July 2013, the mother making threats to kill herself, and the police visited the home and raised no concerns.  There was a visit to the mother by an asylum support group in July 2013, recording the mother stating she would stab herself if she is refused asylum, and wants her daughter to grow up in England and not have to return home.  There is a further reference in October 2013 to the mother taking an overdose, which again is brought to the attention of the authorities in Liverpool, and again this is in the context of her failed asylum application.  At that stage H is not with her and cannot be located, and the evidence appears to indicate that nobody saw or had any information about H&#8217;s whereabouts between October 2013 and January 2014.  </span></p>

A</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> case in relation to the child&#8217;s circumstances are particularly apt in this case, because even with the lack of clarity in relation to H&#8217;s care throughout her life, it is submitted that H&#8217;s habitual residence is established in this country for the reasons set out in her skeleton argument.  H was born in the United Kingdom, and although she is an Albanian citizen that is derived from her mother, and habitual residence does not necessarily flow from that.  There is no evidence that H has ever left the United Kingdom; all of the evidence from the various different sources points to her having remained in this jurisdiction since birth.  It is clear from the information that the court does have, albeit from third party sources, that the mother&#8217;s intention was that her daughter should remain in this jurisdiction and be brought up in this jurisdiction. Although the mother&#8217;s circumstances are far from clear, her ability to integrate into social and family environment is clearly affected by her lack of immigration status, but there is evidence to say that H has integrated into a social and family environment, although there remains uncertainty as to precisely when she went into T's care.  The social worker who attended at the home observed that there was a significant amount of material there for H, which perhaps lends support to the view that was expressed by the maternal grandparents that they had understood H had been cared for by T since October 2013.  In those circumstances, it is submitted by Miss Philips H has habitual residence in this jurisdiction in her own right.  </span></p>

It appears from the information the court has it is the only jurisdiction that she has ever been in.  There has been, in the relatively short period of time that she has been alive, some integration into the social and family environment in England, although there is some uncertainty during part of the time as to precisely where she has been.  The indications are that it was the mother&#8217;s wish for her to be born and brought up in this jurisdiction, and so in the somewhat unique circumstances of this case I am satisfied that her habitual residence is here.</span></p>

However, as Mr. Cameron sets out, the effect of Article 61 is that jurisdiction must be exercised under the Regulation rather than under the Hague Convention of 19 October 1996 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children (the Convention). In those circumstances, it is submitted, rightly, that the court cannot make use of the Article 15 procedure because that is to request a transfer to another Member State, and Albania is not a Member State.  It is also submitted, in my judgment rightly, that the court could not use the transfer request under Article 8 of the Convention, since Article 61(a) of the Regulation acts to provide for jurisdiction only to be exercised under the Regulation and that this would be consistent with the practice guide&#8217;s comment at page 16 that &#8216;the scope for using Article 8 must be limited&#8217;.  So, I do not consider that there is any positive obligation as a result of either the Convention or Brussels II Revised for this court, in the circumstances of this case, to actively consider whether there should be any transfer of the proceedings to Albania.  </span></p>

If those assessments are positive there may need to be arrangements put in place for H&#8217;s placement with those family members in Albania. But until we know the result of those assessments, the court is not going to be in a position to be able to determine whether such a placement will meet H&#8217;s welfare needs.</span></p>
