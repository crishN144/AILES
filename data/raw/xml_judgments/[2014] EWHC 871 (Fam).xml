	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is my judgment on a mother&#8217;s appeal against orders made by District Judge Bowman on 26 February 2014 which registered, and permitted enforcement of, a judgment made by Judge Dubarry in the Tribunal de Grande Instance d&#8217;Evry, France on 18 June 2013 (&#8220;the Evry judgment&#8221;). Those orders for registration and enforcement were made pursuant to Article 28(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (&#8220;B2R&#8221;) and FPR 2010 rules 31.8, 31.11 and 31.17. The Evry judgment followed a hearing on 4 June 2013, which the mother did not attend, and awarded the residence of ND, who was born on 9 July 2012 in France, and who therefore was then aged 11 months, to his father, with ample contact to his mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Linked to this appeal is an application by the father under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980. In my decision of <span style="font-style:italic">JRG v EB (Abduction: Brussels II Revised)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2012/1863" uk:canonical="[2012] EWHC 1863 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWHC 1863 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 1 FLR 203" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 1 FLR 203</ref> I ventured the view that where there is a parental responsibility order made in a sister EU state the better procedural course is to apply for registration and enforcement under Chapter III of B2R rather than under the Hague Convention since under the former defences available under the latter would not be available. Here the two applications have proceeded in tandem. The main reason is legal aid. But as it happens it was right that they should have done so as there is here an arguable ground of appeal under Article 23(c) of B2R. Should that ground succeed I will be able to move straight onto the Hague application. This aspect points up the need for the court when giving directions for such an appeal to make a preliminary assessment of its strength. If it seems arguable then linkage with Hague proceedings, as has happened here, would be appropriate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">CJEU and domestic decisions made under the Judgments Regulation show that a successful invocation of the public policy ground will be a very difficult challenge indeed. A criterion of exceptional circumstances applies, which is hardly surprising given that the ground of being contrary to public policy is stressed by the adverb &#8220;manifestly&#8221;. Even fraud may not suffice, as the better remedy is to apply for revocation in the original court &#8211; see <span style="font-style:italic">Interdesco SA v Nullifire Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] 1 Lloyd's Rep 180" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] 1 Lloyd&#8217;s Rep 180</ref>. A judgment obtained in defiance of an English anti-suit injunction will likely offend our notion of public policy &#8211; see <span style="font-style:italic">Philip Alexander Securities and Futures Ltd v Bamberger</span> [1997] I.L.Pr 73, but contrast <span style="font-style:italic">Golubovich v Golubovich</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] Fam 88" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] Fam 88</ref> where a Russian divorce was recognised notwithstanding that it had been obtained in breach of an English anti-suit injunction. Differences in substantive law will not suffice to invoke the ground. Article 35 of the Judgments Regulation and Article 24 of B2R specifically forbid a challenge to the jurisdiction of the original court on the ground of public policy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have mentioned the public policy ground has been augmented in B2R by the qualifying phrase &#8220;taking into account the best interests of the child&#8221;. All EU countries apply the paramountcy of the best interests of the child as the governing principle. The question whether a registering court can examine the application of that principle by the original court has been considered in a number of domestic cases.

One of those grounds is that laid down in paragraph (2), in order to ensure the adequate protection of the rights of a defendant against whom judgment is given in default of appearance abroad. Article 27(2) provides that a judgment shall not be recognized ' ... if the defendant was not duly served with the document which instituted the proceedings in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defence'. That provision takes account of the fact that certain Contracting States make provision for the fictitious service of process where the defendant has no known place of residence. The effects that are deemed to follow from such fictitious service vary and the probability of the defendant's actually being informed of service, so as to give him sufficient time to prepare his defence, may vary considerably, depending on the type of fictitious service provided for in each legal system.</p>

As I have mentioned above in Art 34.2 of the Judgments Regulation this is: &#8220;unless the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for him to do so&#8221;. Thus a defendant will lose the protection of article 34(2) if he failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for him to do so. According to Dicey, Morris and Collins at para 14-234 "this aims to overcome the sense of disquiet at the behaviour of a defendant who knows perfectly well of the proceedings which have been commenced against him, but who elects to do nothing about them, and then relies on a shortcoming in the service of process." This is a perfectly rational and understandable provision. I can discern no reason why it was not included in article 23(c) of B2R. Instead the conjunctive proviso is &#8220;unless it is determined that such person has accepted the judgment unequivocally&#8221;. It is hard to imagine a state of affairs where this comes into play. The appellant is appealing registration of the judgment, and therefore by definition, resists its implementation. It is hard to envisage a scenario where she would have been unequivocally accepting the judgment beforehand. </p>

Accordingly, with some considerable misgivings, I conclude that subsequent inaction by the mother is irrelevant to the merits of an appeal against registration and enforcement of a parental responsibility order. Equally, the fact that the mother may have concealed her whereabouts appears to have been deliberately excluded by the draughtsman as a relevant matter.</p>

By contrast, the father contends that the words are perfectly clear and that the proposal for residence and visiting rights extended only until the hearing of the joint application. I have to observe that the father's position is not very logical because, after all, by the time of the next hearing, the relevant events would have happened and so the proposed future residence of the mother in England and his visiting rights would be meaningless.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In fairness, the mother's appeal on the ground of public policy was but faintly advanced. It is hopeless. The fact that a judgment was given in her absence awarding residence to the father is completely unexceptional. There is nothing in the procedure leading up to the hearing or in the terms of the judgment which gets anywhere close to the very high threshold required to be passed in order for this ground to succeed. The submissions came close to seeking a review of the substance of the Evry judgment; this is, of course, totally forbidden by article 26.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn therefore to the mother&#8217;s second ground. As I have said, the inaction by the mother following notification of the judgment is inexcusable. Were this case being determined under article 34.2 of the Judgments Regulation that would be a fatal blow to her appeal. But, for mysterious reasons, this conduct by her is irrelevant in proceedings being determined under article 23 of B2R. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact that the mother was properly served, in the strict technical sense, under French law does not prevent me from making a realistic judgment as to whether she in fact had sufficient opportunity to prepare her defence. As Coulson J has rightly stated &#8220;what matters most is not form but function&#8221;. The father must have known that attempted service of her at his own address was an absurd charade. He deliberately refused to supply copies of the relevant documents to the mother&#8217;s solicitor when asked. In my judgment he was doing all that he could to make the mother's defence of his application as difficult as possible. As against that, the mother was arguably almost as obstinate in refusing to seek copies of the documents from the court in Evry or from appearing at the hearing, if only to seek an adjournment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied that for the purposes of Article 23(c) this was a judgment given in default of appearance of the mother. It is true that the Annex II certificate states that the judgment was not rendered by default. This reflects, I imagine, the undeniable fact that under French law the mother was properly served. It may also reflect the fact that the mother was a joint applicant in the first application (although the court issued an order that that application had lapsed due her non-appearance). Be that as it may, the authorities make very clear that I am to judge the reality of the situation, and I have no doubt that the mother did not &#8220;appear&#8221; (in either sense of the verb) on the father&#8217;s application for sole custody.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, although the balance is exceedingly fine, the conduct of the father is more culpable than that of the mother. In circumstances where the mother had not laid eyes on the father's originating application for sole custody and where the father had refused to supply it to her solicitor I am satisfied, notwithstanding her own foolish conduct, that she was not served in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable her to arrange for her defence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I therefore hold that the mother's appeal succeeds under article 23(c). Although the result will be that I now must move on to the linked Hague Convention proceedings I would observe that this case has demonstrated the merit of my observations in <span style="font-style:italic">JRG v EB (Abduction: Brussels II Revised). </span>The submissions on the appeal were made very economically and with high quality. There was no oral evidence. None of the familiar and, it must be said, emotion-laden matters which are the hallmarks of Hague proceedings featured at all. The facts here were exceptional and have led to the very unlikely result of a successful appeal; in the great run of cases that will not be so and the case would have stopped at this point.</p>
