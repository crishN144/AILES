In late 2022, he says that Ms AA withdrew their eldest child from school, and instead enrolled him and his brother in an online school based in England in January 2023.  Later in 2023, Ms AA said that she intended to go to India to spend some time with her family and to enable the children to visit India for the first time.  Mr ZZ was in agreement with this plan. </span></p>

He was aware they did not have a return flight booked, but he expected them to be back in City W in November.  He was aware that the children&#8217;s visas expired in early November, and on around 4 November asked Ms AA to confirm when their flight back was arriving.  He was told that she had applied to extend the visas so they could stay longer, and Mr ZZ agreed to this, although he was surprised to discover that his wife had taken the children&#8217;s birth certificates with her and had all the necessary documents to make the visa application from India.  In due course, Ms AA confirmed that visa extensions had been granted to 14 February 2024 and that they would return shortly before that date.</span></p>

He says that in the later part of that period, they told him that they missed him and wanted to come home.  On 28 January, having not heard from his wife for two weeks, Mr ZZ received a call in which she said that she was not coming back to City W and that she had issued proceedings in the Indian courts, and would now only communicate with Mr ZZ through her solicitors. </span></p>

The application had been filed on 3 November 2023.   Mr ZZ had one further video call with his children on 10 February 2024 but has not seen or spoken to them since.  Mr ZZ contacted the online school the children had been enrolled with while in City W, and was told that they had been withdrawn from the program in the November or December 2023. He later realised that his wife had taken all of their wedding jewellery with her, and his personal hard drive which he used to back up his laptop.   He says that he offered to his wife that if she returned with the children he would move out of the family home and support them, but she refused. He then issued his application on 22 February 2024.   </span></p>

A remote hearing was listed for 28 February 2024.  Ms AA did not attend that hearing &#8211; the order incorrectly recites that it was made without notice to her, but correctly states that Mr ZZ had effected service on her of the order of Mr Rees KC by WhatsApp, and that Ms AA had failed to comply with the court&#8217;s directions.  Ms Hannah Markham KC declared on a provisional basis that the children were habitually resident in the jurisdiction of England and Wales on the date they were removed to India and had been wrongfully retained in the jurisdiction of India without the consent of Mr ZZ.  The court directed that the children should be made available for video contact with their father at least twice a week.  The children were made wards of court.  Ms AA was directed to file a statement by 5 April 2024 and a remote hearing was listed for 12 April 2024.</span></p>

She had sent the court a letter dated 4 April 2024 setting out her position that she disputed the court&#8217;s jurisdiction, and that the appropriate forum for determining the children&#8217;s welfare was India. She opposed any order requiring her to return the children to England and Wales.  The matter was listed to determine jurisdiction and forum conveniens on 22 May 2024 &#8211; that is the hearing I have conducted and in respect of which this judgment is given.  Both parents were directed to file statements setting out their case.  Mr ZZ complied with that order; Ms AA did not.  </span></p>

Mr ZZ confirmed that details of the hearing had been sent electronically to Ms AA, using the same method that had previously been successful (demonstrated by the fact of Ms AA&#8217;s letter of 4 April addressing the matters that had been directed by Ms Markham KC).  I was satisfied that notice had been effected, and that Ms AA had apparently chosen not to attend the hearing or to comply with the court&#8217;s directions.  I was also satisfied that there was no purpose in adjourning the hearing for further attempts to engage Ms AA to be made, and that it was in the children&#8217;s interests for the court to deal with the preliminary elements of Mr ZZ&#8217;s application promptly. </span></p>

Habitual residence corresponds to the place which reflects some degree of integration by the child in a social and family environment, but the presence of some degree of integration is not determinative.  There must be a sufficient degree of integration, which is a question of fact that requires a global analysis of all relevant information about the child&#8217;s circumstances.  These may include the child&#8217;s life prior to moving country and following the move, the reasons for their stay, their nationality, their schooling, their linguistic knowledge, and their family and social relationships.  The intentions of the parents are relevant to the global analysis, but they are not determinative.</span></p>

As set out, I do not know if they are attending school, whether they have made friends, what activities they do, and whether they know that they are staying in India indefinitely.  Although the boys had been in India for 6 months at the time Mr ZZ issued his application, it is my view, balancing all the considerations I have identified, that they remained habitually resident in the country where City W is located at that time.  Their move to India was anticipated to be temporary and was not pre-planned in any meaningful sense. The children had a stable and secure life in City W and have left behind one of their parents who cannot travel to India easily or at all.  There is little or no evidence as to their degree of integration into the family and social environment in New Delhi, beyond the fact that they are living with relatives.  It is not clear that they are presently in India lawfully given that their visas expired in February, before Mr ZZ&#8217;s application was issued. The only information Ms AA has supplied is that the children have &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">thrived emotionally and psychologically in India, where they feel safe and have established supportive networks&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">.

In this way, proper regard is had to the fact that jurisdiction has been founded in England as of right (see the Spiliada case&#160;</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1986/10.html" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] 3 All ER 843" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] 3 All ER 843</ref></a><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#160;at 855,&#160;</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1986/10.html" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1987] AC 460" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1987">[1987] AC 460</ref></a><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#160;at 477). At this first stage of the inquiry the court will consider what factors there are which point in the direction of another forum (see the Spiliada case&#160;</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1986/10.html" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] 3 All ER 843" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] 3 All ER 843</ref></a><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#160;at 855,&#160;</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1986/10.html" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1987] AC 460" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1987">[1987] AC 460</ref></a><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#160;at 477; Connelly v RTZ Corp plc</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/30.html" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 4 All ER 335" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 4 All ER 335</ref></a><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#160;at 344,&#160;<ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1988] AC 854" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1988">[1988] AC 854</ref>&#160;at 871). If the court concludes at that stage that there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, that is likely to be the end of the matter. But if the court concludes at that stage that there is some other available forum which prima facie is more appropriate for the trial of the action it will ordinarily grant a stay unless the plaintiff can show that there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless not be granted.

The plaintiff will not ordinarily discharge the burden lying upon him by showing that he will enjoy procedural advantages, or a higher scale of damages or more generous rules of limitation if he sues in England; generally speaking, the plaintiff must take a foreign forum as he finds it, even if it is in some respects less advantageous to him than the English forum (the Spiliada case&#160;</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1986/10.html" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] 3 All ER 843" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] 3 All ER 843</ref></a><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#160;at 859,&#160;</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1986/10.html" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1987] AC 460" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1987">[1987] AC 460</ref></a><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#160;at 482; Connelly v RTZ Corp plc</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1997/30.html" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 4 All ER 335" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 4 All ER 335</ref></a><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#160;at 345,&#160;<ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1988] AC 854" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1988">[1988] AC 854</ref>&#160;at 872).

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">I have assumed that the Indian courts are capable of deciding whether the allegations are true, and making appropriate welfare decisions through a process that enables both parents to participate and be represented.  Although Mr ZZ would be in difficulty attending court hearings in India in person, due both to immigration requirements and the practicalities, it appears that he will be permitted to participate remotely, although I do not know whether that permission extends to hearings at which oral evidence is given.   Ms AA could attend court in this jurisdiction as she has indefinite leave to remain, but would also encounter practical difficulties given the cost of travel. She has to date been permitted to attend hearings remotely.  It may be a little more difficult for the views of the children to be obtained and presented to this court, given their location, than it would be in India.</span></p>

The allegations made by Ms AA largely concern events in City W and none concern events in India.  Evidence from police, the NHS, social services, and professionals involved in the lives of the children, as well as friends of the family, will all come from City W.  In contrast, the only witness in India is likely to be Ms AA&#8217;s sister who spent 2 months with the family in City W in 2023.  </span></p>

Ms AA&#8217;s primary concern is that the Indian courts should deal with her application so that the children do not have to return to City W.  It does not follow automatically from a decision that England and Wales is the more appropriate forum for disputes to be resolved that the children would be required to return to City W or to the care of Mr ZZ.  That issue will be determined at the next hearing in this matter.  </span></p>
