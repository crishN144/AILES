The Local Authority was first involved in A&#8217;s life in 2019, when care proceedings were commenced, arising from her exposure to parental domestic abuse. There is no dispute in this case that the father (F) has consistently behaved in a violent and controlling manner towards the mother (M). He admits that when intoxicated by alcohol, he behaves violently and aggressively. His verbal abuse of M is particularly vituperative, calculated to belittle and demean her. F was convicted of an offence of battery of M in May 2021. This involved an incident of strangulation; it was met by a custodial sentence, which was suspended. Only a few months later, July 2021, there were further serious incidents between the couple. At the conclusion of the care proceedings, a Supervision Order was made, predicated on the assumption that the parents had separated. They had not. </span></p>

F recounted the same false story to his probation officer. In fact, throughout the entire period, M and F were together as a couple with F staying in the same house. It would appear that the professionals were entirely credulous and made no robust attempt to test the truth of the accounts they were given, for example by way of spot checks and unannounced visits. The paternal grandparents had been charged with the responsibility for supervising F&#8217;s contact. Whether checks were made in relation to that, I am unclear. M and F&#8217;s relationship has, self-evidently, been an enduring one. </span></p>

F was the father. The baby (R) was born in March 2022. The records reveal a healthy little boy whose progress was entirely developmentally normal. It is significant that on the 19</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> April 2022, the health visitor carried out the new birth visit, at home, where amongst other matters she conducted, as she is required to with every new-born, a safer sleep assessment. In the questionnaire completed with M, M stated that she never took R into her bed with her. She also claimed, falsely as it transpired, that she did not share her bed with anybody else. She denied, again dishonestly, that she did not abuse alcohol or take drugs. A standard booklet was left with her from the Lullaby Trust. In clear and accessible terms, that handbook emphasises babies should always be placed on their back for sleep and given a clear, flat, separate sleep space in the same room as the parents. Firm guidelines are identified, specifically &#8220;no pods, nests or sleep positioners&#8221;. </span></p>

M and F attended the wedding of F&#8217;s sister. M had taken A and J in advance of F and R, to take part in wedding hair and beauty preparations. M began drinking in the afternoon. She continued to drink heavily throughout the day. Shortly before midnight, M and F went to a room that they had booked on the ground floor of the hotel, to put J and R to bed. A had gone to bed earlier in a room occupied by an aunt. At some point in the evening, the paternal grandfather advised the couple to &#8220;slow down&#8221; because they were plainly drinking too much and certainly, far too much to be responsible for such a young baby. A night porter in the hotel had seen the couple on the dance floor and had commented that they were &#8216;steaming&#8217; drunk. </span></p>

He was not changed but remained in the clothes that he had worn for the wedding. M and J also got into the bed. M too went to bed fully clothed. F left the room and returned to the hotel bar where he had more to drink with his family. Eventually, he returned to the room to roll a joint of cannabis, which he went to smoke, outside, before finally going to bed. When he returned and started to undress, he noticed that R&#8217;s entire body had been covered by the duvet. He pulled it back immediately and discovered R lying with his face towards his mother&#8217;s, lifeless and floppy. F ran from the room, plainly and understandably greatly distressed, carrying R in his arms. He made his way to reception to seek assistance from the hotel staff. </span></p>

A total of 4 paramedics worked with R until they were able to restore his heartbeat and transfer him to hospital, shortly before 4am. Later that day, R was transferred to a children&#8217;s hospital specialising in intensive care. Tragically, his condition became moribund and the parents, sadly but properly, upon receiving medical advice, agreed that he should be taken off life support. Death is recorded as having occurred at 14:50 on that day. </span></p>

F has an enthusiastic interest in football. He trains on Wednesday evenings and plays most Saturdays. This is usually followed by going to the pub and watching the league games on the television. As Dr Kate Hellin, the Consultant Psychologist, who assessed M and F, has identified that football is integral to F&#8217;s general mental wellbeing. F also recognises this. From this point, F&#8217;s wrist was in a plaster cast. He was unable to work or play football. It was necessary for him to remain at home for several weeks. His employment is as a roofer. I accept that he went back to work, probably sooner than he should have, with his wrist in a cast, to undertake administrative and supervisory tasks. The above test results show positives for codeine and dihydrocodeine. F states that these were prescribed to treat the pain of the fracture. I have no reason to think that is inaccurate. However, it must be confronted that in this period the tests show positives for cannabis, likely to have been on a daily basis having regard to F&#8217;s own account, cocaine, the prescription painkillers I have mentioned and also for zopiclone (not to be used with alcohol). M&#8217;s statement supporting her application for a Non-Molestation Order, regarding F&#8217;s behaviour also cover this period. Even on F&#8217;s account, there were certainly heated arguments between the couple in this period. M was also drinking excessively and periodically using cocaine. The pathology, discussed below, illustrates why this period is particularly significant. </span></p>

What is striking is the high level of agreement which exists between the couple as to their respective functions in the home. This I find to be secure evidence upon which I can confidently place weight. In her evidence, M was manifestly keen to minimise F&#8217;s violent behaviour in the early weeks of R&#8217;s life. She struck me as keen to portray him in a favourable light. Interestingly, however, she gave a description of F&#8217;s role in the family that, objectively, most people would, these days, consider to be critical. M&#8217;s account was entirely free from criticism. It was a non-judgmental description of family life as she experienced it with F. Strikingly, F agreed with the description entirely, also without any apparent sense of the unfavourable light in which it inevitably cast him. Ms Irving KC, on behalf of F, enquired whether F was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;a hands-on dad&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. M said no, he wasn&#8217;t. She described him as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;more of a hands-off dad&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. She told me F left the house early in the morning, worked all day as a roofer and dedicated most, frequently all of, Saturdays to football and his teammates. He took no part at all in caring for the children, feeding them, entertaining them or helping in any way with their general welfare. M told me, I am bound to say, somewhat unconvincingly, that F had occasionally changed R&#8217;s nappy. Though M was looking after the house, preparing the meals and caring for three children under 5, it never seemed to occur to either of them that F might help out domestically in some way. M accepted, without criticism, that feeding R in the night and attending to him was entirely her responsibility. There was not even a whiff of resentment towards the father in the description of this routine. This was simply a description of her normal everyday life which she accepted. </span></p>

He told me, with no sense of irony, that he had initially tried helping with A but it was obvious to him that M was much better at it and thereafter he left it to her. Though in the tragic circumstances of this case, I place no emphasis upon it, I nonetheless record that at no point did the character and personality of any of these children find its way into the evidence. Neither party suggested that the introduction of a third child into the house had added to M&#8217;s burden. F, who has been critical of the mother&#8217;s drinking, has never suggested, at any stage, that her care of the children or her attention to domestic routine was in any way deficient. I had a strong sense that this was important to him. I also consider that he would not have held back had he considered M to be falling short in either respect. The arguments between this couple, always fuelled by drink, focused on their jealousy of each other&#8217;s independence. M complains of F inveigling his way into each corner of her life, repeatedly checking up on her with his embarrassingly frequent telephone calls. F accepts this. However, M also resents F&#8217;s time away from her with his teammates on Saturdays. It is also important to note that M was not unsupported in her care of the children but was able to call upon significant help from her mother and sister. The care proceedings relating to A were properly predicated on the children&#8217;s exposure to parental domestic violence. Neither parent strikes me as having shown any real insight into the emotional impact of such exposure. There is, however, no suggestion that there was physical harm to or neglect of A. Nor is there any suggestion that home conditions were poor. </span></p>

When I asked Mr Jones KC, on behalf of M, at the PHR, whether the cause of death was actively contested, he was able to take instructions from M very quickly. I am confident that she has recognised how R came to die for some considerable time but had struggled to articulate it in these proceedings. She is suffused with guilt and remorse. </span></p>

These were sustained in a forensic window between 12 and 24 hours before death. They are consistent with CPR/resuscitation attempts. However, callus formation, which was visible to the naked eye, indicated a fracture to the posterior right fourth rib. This was confirmed histologically as an osteocartilaginous fracture, near to the osteochondral junction. Recent haemorrhage was identified within the fracture, which was consistent with refracturing at around 12-24 hours prior to death. It is important to record the following passages of the report: </span></p>

Deaths due to overlaying occur as a result of an adult or older sibling overlaying the body of the baby which affects the baby&#8217;s ability to breathe. This gentle occlusive force applied to the body of the baby can occur to the nose and or mouth preventing air entering and leaving the lungs or over the chest/abdominal area affecting respiratory effort or indeed a combination for both. This causes an asphyxial type death &#8211; asphyxia meaning deprivation of oxygen. Signs of asphyxia include petechial haemorrhages which for the most part in cases of overlaying are either absent or few. The respiratory obstruction caused by the overlaying process can also produce bleeding from the nose and or mouth and within the lungs. </span></p>

Therefore, although the circumstances do raise the possibility of overlaying as the cause of death in this case, in my opinion there is insufficient evidence for me to be sure and for this cause of death to be properly established. However, it is well known that intra-alveolar haemorrhage can be absent in cases of overlaying. Deaths due to overlaying have an increased association with alcohol and/or drugs in the adult sharing the bed with the baby. This latter statement is based on my experience. I have also considered suffocation &#8211; either deliberate or accidental as a cause of death in this case. However, no marks or injuries were noted to the baby&#8217;s face, to the under surface of the skin of the face, to the back of the throat or to the upper airways. Therefore, there is no evidence to support this view but it should be noted that cases of suffocation of a baby as young as this can produce no sign/signs. The autopsy identified the presence of ischaemic hypoxic change within the brain consistent with this baby suffering cardiorespiratory arrest and a downtime of 1 hour 25 minutes before his circulation was re-established.</span></p>

There were multiple anterior rib fractures involving right ribs 3, 4 and 5 along with anterior rib fractures to left ribs 2, 3, 4 and 5 in my opinion consistent with attempts to resuscitate this baby. Additionally, a single posterior rib fracture was identified to the right 4th rib with a callous clearly identified to the naked eye at the time of autopsy and identified just lateral to the vertebral column at the costovertebral angle. Histological examination of this fracture did indeed confirm the presence of an old/previous fracture with this aged between 3 &#8211; 6 weeks. Therefore, it is my opinion that this fracture would be inconsistent with being caused by birth trauma as baby [R] was 11 weeks of age at the time of his death. Posterior rib fractures require a significant degree of force to inflict and are caused by a forceful side to side chest compression and are associated with forceful gripping/squeezing of the chest. In my opinion this injury would be consistent with a non-accidental injury. As it is however a single posterior rib fracture this clearly did not cause the death of baby [R] nor did it contribute to it. It was inflicted in life and would have caused pain and suffering.&#8221;</span></p>

This would also have been associated with squeezing or gripping forcefully. Mr Jones explored the possibility that it might have occurred in an earlier incident of overlaying, given that both parents volunteered that, despite advice, they had regularly co-slept with R. Dr Armour could not regard this as likely. She considered it implausible but did not discount it as impossible. There was ultimately no supportive history to the theory and she was very clear that the side to side and significantly forceful chest compression required was far more strongly indicative of non-accidental injury. </span></p>

With respect to both of them, I did not find this alternative account entirely clear or coherent. The essence of it was that whilst R was in his baby bouncer, supervised by his grandmother, J fell on top of R, which caused the bouncer to come to the floor, the suggestion being that it generated side to side chest compression. The mother states that she heard a clear cry of pain which was sufficient to indicate to her that something serious had happened. However, both women were clear that R had recovered quickly and showed no evidence of pain, when minutes later, his football shirt was taken off and changed. Quite why it was necessary to change his shirt, neither was clear. The kind of fracture being considered here would have, according to the consensus of the medical evidence, generated considerable pain which was not described. If I may say so, I think this incident was rooted in a real event but, even in the way it was recounted by M and grandmother gave me a strong impression that both of them felt it to be grasping at straws. Dr Fonf&#233; rejects the explanations for the fracture aligning herself with the views of Armour i.e., significant compressive squeezing mechanism with the adults&#8217; fingers pressed against the ribs alongside R&#8217;s spine. Dr Fonf&#233; notes that posterior ribs are more difficult to fracture because they are intrinsically more stable as they are up against the vertebra. She goes on to state that, when lying down, the spine cannot be pushed forwards or the ribs pushed over the transverse spinous processes because the bones are aligned and there is nowhere else for them to go. In explicit terms, she discounts both the fall in the bouncy chair and an injury in the course of overlaying as implausible. </span></p>

He described a number of problematic personality traits. Accordingly, I have considered whether he would meet criteria for an antisocial personality disorder with reference to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Version 5 (2013). He meets some of its criteria: he has failed to conform to lawful or culturally normative ethical behaviour as shown by his criminal activity and interpersonal violence. He has been dishonest and hostile, sometimes using violence instrumentally to achieve an outcome (to silence [M] or to get her to listen to him, A5.3, A5.17). He is impulsive and prone to self-destructive behaviour including substance use, alcohol excesses and gambling. However, I did not find him to be lacking in empathy, unable to form mutual intimate relationships, meal manipulative in the terms of the criteria for antisocial personality disorder or habitually deceitful or callous. Taken together, I do not believe that he meets criteria for an antisocial personality disorder though he has antisocial personality traits.</span></p>

In adult hood, his violence has been elicited by a combination of intoxication and provocation. He believes that provocation alone would not be enough to cause him to be violent. His use of alcohol and/or using drugs distort his perspective and make him more interpersonally sensitive, paranoid and inclined to misperceive and overreact to interpersonal situations.

Most notably, in the forensic window within which the fracture was sustained, there was a significant change in the family&#8217;s circumstances. For an extended period, F was at home, all day, due to breaking his wrist in a footballing injury. It deprived him of the outlet of work, as a roofer, which is manifestly important to him. It prevented him playing football, training and the associated activities, which Dr Hellin indicates are integral to his sense of general wellbeing. Two key stabilising factors in his life had therefore been lost to him. Furthermore, the day-to-day dynamics of the household had transformed as the couple was effectively thrust together. As I have stated, the test results reveal that F was drinking heavily and smoking an extensive amount of cannabis. He was also taking pain relief and Zopiclone (prescribed for insomnia).  M was also drinking heavily and using cocaine. If M&#8217;s statement in support of her application for a Non-Molestation Order is to be read at face value, there is, at very least, a continuation of controlling and violent behaviour by F in this period. Given the clear interrelationship of drugs and alcohol with F&#8217;s violent behaviour, identified by Dr Hellin, I consider this likely to be true. In her evidence, whilst M stands by the allegations she makes in the statement dated 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">nd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> June 2022, she contends that she had got the dates wrong and that the behaviour she describes had not continued, following R&#8217;s birth. The statement does not permit of any ambiguity and with little hesitation I consider it to be reliable. Moreover, I note that M describes F&#8217;s behaviour as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;deteriorating&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">: </span></p>

Perhaps what is most unusual is his obvious inability to see any parental shortcoming in this. He made absolutely no attempt, as some fathers do, to amplify or exaggerate his role, he had plainly decided that practical parenting, of any kind, was not his responsibility. He delegated that, he told me in evidence, to M whom he considered </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;was good at it&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. M told me, when asked, that she thought F had </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;sometimes changed a nappy&#8221;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> I am bound to say that I found even that rather unconvincing. F, in response to Ms Bowcock&#8217;s questioning, as to how he had adjusted his own life following the birth of R, responded, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;I don&#8217;t stay at the pub as long&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. He was not, in any way, being flippant or discourteous. In my assessment, he was genuinely trying to answer the question. But the poverty of his response is telling. I am afraid I am also bound to say, again, that in any event, the evidence does not support even this limited assertion. The fact is that F did not change his lifestyle in any way to accommodate a new baby, even though he was at home all day. I recognise that his injury would limit what he could do but it was far from completely disabling. I have noted above, for example, that though he could not actively participate in roofing, he went back to work, in a limited capacity, earlier than he needed to or perhaps ought to have done. M seems to have accepted F&#8217;s role without rancour or resentment. Certainly, as she recounted F&#8217;s very limited involvement, she portrayed no hostility towards him. That he was, as Ms Irving put it, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;a hands-off dad&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> is entirely uncontentious. I do not doubt that F was delighted to have a son and distraught by his death but there is a vacuum in his insight and emotional responses to the responsibilities and privileges of fatherhood. M&#8217;s relationship with R was of an altogether richer and more intuitive complexion. </span></p>

Dr Annavarapu emphasised that which each of the experts agrees, namely that a posterior rib fracture requires both forceful and side to side chest compression which would be far in excess of normal handling. What requires to be confronted is whether or to what extent, F&#8217;s violent behaviour is incorporated into the broader evidential canvas which requires to be considered when identifying a likely perpetrator. </span></p>

F has described M as a loving, attentive, caring parent. The elder child is five, the younger is three. There has been no allegation that M has hurt either of them or has failed in any aspect of their practical care. M also has backup and support from her own mother. There is no report of M having been violent to F or indeed to anybody else. Perhaps inevitably, in the light of what I have said above, any insight into the children&#8217;s lives comes from M&#8217;s evidence. It is pertinent to note that M spoke movingly and spontaneously about R&#8217;s temperament and nature. She told me he was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;always such a good baby&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. She found him easy to care for. She was very much aware that he was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;very mummy&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, as she described in her statement. She talked about how R would follow her with his eyes. She said he could sometimes be &#8220;quite clingy&#8221; with her. Dr Hellin, in her report, considers that M is very resistant to any compliment, indeed, she recoils from them. Nonetheless, it is important that she hears that I consider that the evidence amply establishes that she had an instinctive and intuitive understanding of both R&#8217;s physical and emotional needs. There was manifestly a healthy bond between mother and child. </span></p>

First the improbability of a number of similar incidents alleged against a defendant being false is a consideration which should naturally inform a jury&#8217;s deliberations on whether propensity has been proved. Secondly, obvious similarities in various incidents may constitute mutual corroboration of those incidents. Each incident may thus inform another.

The evidential framework, governing admissibility of propensity evidence, in a criminal trial, predicated on the criminal standard of proof, is very different from that in an essentially investigative process in family proceedings. In the Family Court, the Judge will, invariably, be scrutinising a broad evidential landscape. Where the lodestar for the Court&#8217;s approach is the paramountcy of the child&#8217;s welfare, a very wide category of evidence will fall for consideration. This will include hearsay evidence, be it first or second hand, in documentary format or in oral evidence. It will also include expert opinion evidence. The standard of proof is, of course, the civil standard, requiring facts to be proved on the balance of probabilities.

In this country we do not require documentary proof. We rely heavily on oral evidence, especially from those who were present when the alleged events took place. Day after day, up and down the country, on issues large and small, judges are making up their minds whom to believe. They are guided by many things, including the inherent probabilities, any contemporaneous documentation or records, any circumstantial evidence tending to support one account rather than the other, and their overall impression of the characters and motivations of the witnesses. The task is a difficult one. It must be performed without prejudice and preconceived ideas. But it is the task which we are paid to perform to the best of our ability.</span></p>

If he finds it more likely than not that it did not take place, then it is treated as not having taken place. He is not allowed to sit on the fence. He has to find for one side or the other. Sometimes the burden of proof will come to his rescue: the party with the burden of showing that something took place will not have satisfied him that it did. But generally speaking a judge is able to make up his mind where the truth lies without needing to rely upon the burden of proof.&#8221;</span></p>

The exercise is a parallel one and, for the reasons that Lady Hale has identified in the passage above, the obligation on the Judge every bit as exacting. There will, inevitably, be cases where the identity of the perpetrator will be uncertain. Paradigmatically, injuries to a child occur in the hands of a parent or carer. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> requires the court to focus not only on the significant harm sustained by the child but on its attributability. Inevitably, within the home environment, there are unlikely to be witnesses. The investigative process must track down ascertainable facts from the broadest canvas available and, where possible, draw such inferences as those facts will support. It is frequently a difficult task, but it is not one that can be shirked. The danger in failing to confront it is that an innocent individual may be tainted by a finding that has a direct impact, both on her and on the child. A finding which leaves a parent in a pool of potential perpetrators is likely to adversely influence the nature and extent of the contact arrangements or indeed, on where and with whom the child will live in the future.  Of course, the imperative of child protection must not generate a reason to burden unsatisfactory evidence with a greater weight than it can legitimately support. That would create injustice to all, not least the subject children, but neither does it absolve the Judge of the responsibility to confront the findings that the evidence properly establishes. The same obligation for forensic rigour applies to the lawyers. </span></p>

The parties are agreed that it is and they are right. It is correct, as the Court of Appeal observed, that Re B was not directly concerned with the identification of perpetrators but with whether the child had been harmed. However, the observations of Lord Hoffmann and Lady Hale, quoted at paragraph 12 above, make it clear that the same approach is to be applied to the identification of perpetrators as to any other factual issue in the case. This issue shows quite clearly that there is no necessary connection between the seriousness of an allegation and the improbability that it has taken place. The test is the balance of probabilities, nothing more and nothing less.&#8221;</span></p>

Miss Frances Judd QC, on behalf of the children&#8217;s guardian in this case, has stressed that the guardian would rather have a finding on the balance of probabilities than no finding at all. There are many reasons for this. The main reason is that it will promote clarity in identifying the future risks to the child and the strategies necessary to protect him from them. For example, a different care plan may be indicated if there is a risk that the parent in question will ill-treat or abuse the child from the plan that may be indicated if there is a risk that she will be vulnerable to relationships with men who may ill-treat or abuse the child. </span></p>

Both parents said that he was easy to care for. On this point, I can say that their descriptions were spontaneous, guileless, and consistent with wider family and professional observations. Given that M undertook nearly the entirety of R&#8217;s care, R was, unsurprisingly, observed to be most comfortable with his mother. It was she to whom he turned for comfort. There is no suggestion, within the evidence, that M was under stress in her day-to-day care of R. Despite her longstanding challenges with alcohol dependency, M has been functional. All this evidence points to M having the same strong and instinctive bond with R that she has with the older children. Whilst a strong bond by no means excludes the possibility of causing a non-accidental injury, it is a recognised contraindicator. </span></p>

Though, as mentioned above, it was insinuated that he could not have caused the injuries because he was wearing a plaster cast covering his hand and wrist at the time, this had, in fact, been replaced, after a few days, by a modest splint which, as he agreed in evidence, permitted him to use his fingers freely to the extent that he drove a car and undertook some light duties at work. I noted when this was put to him in cross examination, he yielded to it without any prevarication. </span></p>

It is equally clear that he enjoys his football, both playing and following his team. Both these provide his life with ballast. In the period in which R&#8217;s fracture was sustained, this ballast was no longer available to him. There was a very significant change in the family&#8217;s routine. It is a fact that F smoked a lot of cannabis in this period and drank excessively. It is also the case that he used other drugs e.g., cocaine. In her application for a non-Molestation injunction, M stated that he was violent and aggressive towards her at this time. She resiles from that to a limited degree, in that she now says that she cannot remember whether F was violent after the birth of R. I do not accept the change in her evidence as reliable. I find it far more likely that the detail of her statement, filed in support of the injunction, is accurate and, given this couple&#8217;s history, the drinking and drug misuse in this period was likely to have generated the dynamic that led to F becoming violent and aggressive in the way that M described. This was an established pattern. </span></p>

In his evidence F accepted this with some candour. It is also the case that frequently, when he loses his temper, he is not only violent but out of control. On three occasions, at least, as I have mentioned above, he has strangled M with his bare hands. On at least one occasion, M lost consciousness. In her statement for the injunction, M described F as punching his fists into walls and through cupboard doors. </span></p>

There is here an established pattern of F becoming violent and losing control. This is exacerbated with drug and alcohol consumption, which, as I have stated, the evidence establishes as being used in excess at the relevant time. Also, M and F were living in much more confined circumstances, arising from F&#8217;s injury. Both, I note, had identified their respective needs for privacy and space. The changed situation compromised this. I have concluded that F was behaving, as M asserted in her application, violently and personally out of control. I emphasise that all these are ascertainable facts from which reasonable inferences can be drawn. They also establish a propensity for F to lose control, in an extreme way, and to become violent. By contrast, there is no such evidence relating to M&#8217;s behaviour. Cumulatively, for the reasons that I have identified throughout this judgment, I consider the evidence points markedly towards F as most likely to have caused R's fractured fourth posterior rib. On the balance of probabilities, I find that he did. </span></p>

Built into the civil standard of proof is an inevitable risk of error, with which conscientious practitioners, litigating very serious injury to a child are sometimes uncomfortable. The civil standard of proof applies in Children Act proceedings because it gives effect to the central objective of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> itself, namely, to promote the welfare of the child. Any application of an elevated standard of proof runs the risk of leaving an unnecessary pall of suspicion over a non-perpetrating parent which may hinder the construction of clear and effective strategies, designed both to protect the child and promote the full range of opportunities for her relationship with either or both parents. Indeed, the impact of an &#8216;uncertain perpetrator&#8217; finding is more likely to limit the options for a child than to expand them. For this reason, it is to be avoided if possible. Declining to identify a perpetrator, where the evidence establishes it, is not merely erring on the side of caution, it is a failure to exercise the duty imposed by law. The test is simply whether an identified individual is more likely than not to have caused the injuries, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;nothing more, nothing less&#8221;.</span></p>

I am entirely satisfied that this plan is in the children&#8217;s best interests. </span></p>
