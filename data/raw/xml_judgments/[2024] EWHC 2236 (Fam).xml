Within days of separation the Respondent issued a C100. Days later, the Appellant issued a Family Law Act application. That application was dealt with by way of undertakings given by the Respondent on 16 September 2020. The Appellant alleged the Respondent had breached the undertakings and the matter returned to court. The case came before Mr Recorder Saxby KC who found the Respondent had indeed breached the undertakings he had given on 16 September 2020 and made a non-molestation order in the Appellant&#8217;s favour. The Respondent was unsuccessful in his attempt to appeal that order.</span></p>

I have had particular regard to the welfare checklist and reached the conclusion that, until [the Respondent] has shown more insight into and acceptance of his behaviour in the past and until he is able to show considerably more control over his emotions and behaviour, his contact with the boys must be professionally supervised, by an independent social work professional in the community or in a contact centre.

Any course manager/therapist must be shown the judgments of the court so as to approach the issues on an informed basis.

That was a procedural error. However, the Appellant has not sought permission to appeal the order of 10 May 2024. In coming to that decision, I am told that she has been pragmatic and taken an approach which she hopes is efficient of time and money. Nevertheless, at one point during oral argument, Counsel on behalf of the Appellant told me that if the appeal against the order of 22 May succeeded and I decided to remit the case for rehearing, the point would be taken at the lower court that the next step should be to hear the application for permission to apply on notice. That submission troubled me. It seems to me that either the order of 10 May 2024 is the subject of an appeal, or it is not. In the absence of an appeal against that order, the order of 10 May 2024 still stands, and the Respondent has been granted permission to apply. In those circumstances, I consider that the gateway for the substantive application has been opened and, absent an appeal, cannot now be closed.</span></p>

His case was that he had changed; that supervised contact was only ever going to be a practical short-term solution and it needed to move on; that he loved the children very much and that the notes of his supervised contact with the children were all positive.

Whilst he did that, I acquainted myself with documents the Respondent had prepared, and which had not reached me. Although he forwarded to me numerous documents, the Respondent was correct in his assessment that the position statements he wished me to read were themselves relatively short. I took time to read the documents. In doing so I concentrated on a position statement the Respondent had prepared for a District Judge and another he had prepared for the appeal proceedings, and which was dated 7 August 2024 together with attachments to that document.  Amongst the papers attached to the position statement dated 7 August 2024 is a letter from Synergy Counselling, Training and Consultancy and certificates relating to various courses he has completed. Having read them, they appeared to be the same documents the Respondent had submitted to HHJ Davies. I also reminded myself of the content of the CDAP report dated 3 January 2024.  Time has also allowed me to consider the reports from supervised contact which the Respondent has submitted and I note, for the purposes of this appeal, that all are positive. I have also considered all the photographs he sent in as well as a polygraph report and statements which appeared to me to be more relevant to a family finance application. Amongst the papers there are also numerous examples of the letters he has written to the children. </span></p>

Within that document he restated the case he had placed before HHJ Davies on 22 May 2024. The Respondent supplemented his written submissions orally before me. In his oral submissions to me, the Respondent emphasised that he had done all that had been asked of him by Mr Recorder Roche KC and by Sir Jonathan Cohen. He had undergone therapy with a specialist psychotherapist and had voluntarily participated in and completed the CDAP course. He had done what was required of him swiftly and he should not be penalised for his rapid response. There had already been, he estimated, 20 hearings in this case. He stated that continued protracted litigation was not in the children&#8217;s best interests. Contact had been supervised for far too long and it needed to move forward. The Appellant, he says, wishes to prevent contact between him and the children. </span></p>

He told me that since I had stayed the order of HHJ Davies contact had not reverted to supervised contact under the previous order as it ought but had stopped. As he advanced that argument it became clear that the Appellant and the Respondent could not agree the reason it had stopped. The Appellant told me through counsel that she had stated her agreement to supervised contact continuing but the Respondent had refused such contact. The Respondent giving me a contrary account. I do not seek to resolve that dispute at the hearing. I simply note that the Appellant confirmed before me her agreement that if the appeal succeeded, she would agree to supervised contact continuing as before whilst any remitted hearing proceeded in the lower court. That was a formal stated position and one which during the hearing I said I would record in this judgment.</span></p>

The order of 22 May 2024 was made after a short, remote hearing during what I expect was a very busy list. Further, I accept the Respondent&#8217;s submission that the learned Judge was motivated by wanting to progress contact in an efficient manner given the significant financial and emotional cost of these protracted proceedings on the parties. However, I consider that in this case she fell into serious procedural error and that she made a decision which was wrong and cannot stand. Accordingly, at the conclusion of the rolled up appeal hearing, I granted the Appellant permission to appeal and indicated that I would allow the appeal for the reasons that I gave orally that day and which I said I would set out and expand upon in this judgment.</span></p>

It is clear from the transcript that the Appellant did not accept that the Respondent had fundamentally changed such that contact with the children could progress safely from supervised to unsupervised. However, the hearing on 22 May 2024 did not permit the Appellant to make a substantive challenge to the evidence which she did not accept. Whilst the overriding objective applied to HHJ Davies&#8217; case management decisions, moving from supervised to unsupervised context in the context of the history of this case was a significant and substantive step.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> ought to have been applied.

The Respondent asserted he had changed and posed no risk. The Appellant clearly did not accept that and asserted that despite the courses he had undertaken, he had not fundamentally changed and continued to pose a risk to the children. In this case determination of the issue of whether or not the Respondent had changed or continued to pose a risk to the children was central to the decision of whether the contact could progress from supervised contact to unsupervised contact, Where, as here, there was a significant challenge to the evidence of change, I consider that the Respondent&#8217;s application should have been set down  for a hearing in which the challenged evidence could be tested through cross-examination of the Respondent and potentially the CDAP reporter and the psychotherapist upon whose report the Respondent relied. The order of 22 May 2024 did not provide an effective mechanism for such challenge and accordingly was, in my view, unfair.</span></p>

At paragraph 29 above I have set out the order HHJ Davies made on 22 May 2024. By reason of the provisions of that order, contact was to progress from supervised to unsupervised contact upon the receipt of a positive assessment to be provided by the Independent Social Worker who had been observing the Respondent&#8217;s contact with the children. The mechanism established by the order delegated the decision to progress from supervised to unsupervised contact to the Independent Social Worker. I consider that HHJ Davies was wrong to delegate that judicial function to the Independent Social Worker. The decision should have been made by the judge herself after a hearing which permitted effective challenge of the Respondent&#8217;s evidence of change and consideration of the best interests of the children after application of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and Practice Direction 12 J.</span></p>

The Independent Social Worker did not have a copy of the case papers. Her role was solely limited to being a supervisor of the Respondent&#8217;s contact with the children. She did not have access to the case papers or knowledge of the Appellant&#8217;s challenge to the evidence of change.  In such circumstances, whilst I am sure she would have acted in good faith and as objectively as possible, she simply would not have had the material necessary to make an informed decision about whether or not it was in the children&#8217;s best interests to progress contact from supervised to unsupervised contact nor could she decide whether that contact would be safe. In the event, the content of the email of 21 June 2024 (set out above) from the Independent Social Work Service to HHJ Davies is not surprising. </span></p>
