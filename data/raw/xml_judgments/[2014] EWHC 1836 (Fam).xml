L&#8217;s grandparents offer to care for him in England, but their proposal is not without difficulties, and does not attract the support of the local authority or L&#8217;s guardian.  There is a local authority application for a public law order which would become active if L were left here by his father; L faces a real prospect of a childhood in long-term foster care if he remains in England. </p>

I heard from L&#8217;s guardian.  By secure video-link established to Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan region, I received the oral evidence of three members of the father&#8217;s family.  The oral evidence of the paternal family members supplemented written statements; although the preparation of these statements did not strictly comply with the guidance given by Peter Jackson J in <span style="font-style:italic">NN v ZZ &amp; Others</span> [2013] EWHC 2261 (Fam), I was nonetheless satisfied (on reading the statements, hearing the witnesses, and receiving the detailed written evidence of the solicitor who obtained the statements) that they were evidentially sound.  The paternal family gave evidence by way of secure link provided by &#8216;eyenetwork.com&#8217;, a global video-conferencing service, in accordance with the guidance in <span style="font-style:italic">Re ML (Use of Skype Technology)</span> [2013] EWHC 2091 (Fam).  With respect to the preparation of the relevant written evidence and the arrangements for receiving the oral evidence from Erbil, I wish to record my appreciation to the father&#8217;s solicitor, and (in respect of the video-link) additionally to the court staff at Middlesbrough Combined Court, for attending to these issues so conscientiously.</p>

I also have reports from an independent social worker (Paul Greenhalgh), following his assessments of the maternal grandparents.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At all preparatory stages of this application, and indeed when the hearing began, the mother and maternal grandparents were firmly opposed to the father&#8217;s application, and his plans to remove L from this jurisdiction; although neither the mother nor the grandparents sought to disturb the current arrangement whereby L has his primary home with his father in England, they proposed that L should move to live with the grandparents if the father relocated to Kurdistan without L.  Their position was argued vigorously throughout the hearing, and they gave evidence to this effect.  At the conclusion of the evidence and before the closing submissions of the advocates, I was advised that the mother had reflected on the evidence, and, that while she continued to have concerns about aspects of the father&#8217;s relocation plan, she had resolved no longer actively to oppose the application.  The grandparents, through Mrs Averis, indicated that they would wish to support their daughter in her decision, notwithstanding the pain which that decision plainly brought them.</p>

For a few days, he did not see L; L was plainly upset by this, and missed his father.  While the father&#8217;s stance was ill-considered it was mercifully short-lived; he subsequently rationalised it by reference to his increasing sense of being undermined at every turn by the maternal family in his care of L.  Specifically he was frustrated at having to deal with allegations that he had had harmed L (this was, as is apparent from the history above, not the first such referral).  The father&#8217;s position in rejecting L at this point, even for those reasons, and even though short-lived, is more than mildly concerning, given that he now wishes to remove L in his full-time care to live abroad.  I can state at this stage that I am nonetheless satisfied on all that I have read and heard that, while I do not believe that this was a mature or welfare-based decision, it does not reveal any worrying ambivalence or lack of attachment to L.</p>

L spent at least one night each weekend with his grandparents, and generally one tea-time mid-week.  When L has stayed with his grandparents, he has been taken to school punctually, and the grandparents have shown appropriate interest in his education.  In spite of the family tensions, this is encouraging, particularly when looking at the proposed arrangements for the future.  When the father has visited Kurdistan on his own (summer 2012, February 2013), he has asked the maternal grandparents to care for L and they have done so.  While Mr Greenhalgh (the independent social worker) has not actively supported the grandparents&#8217; ability to offer long-term care for L, he nonetheless has commented positively on the contribution which the grandparents have made to L&#8217;s life: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">they are a humble couple who are not looking for medals or haloes [but] I do think that a formal acknowledgement of what they have achieved for L would be helpful to them</span>&#8221;.

The father had, after all, come here as an asylum seeker (though it appears that the rest of his family remained in Kurdistan); the father asserted confidently to me that the situation is now materially different (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Saddam Hussein was alive then</span> [i.e. in 2002]<span style="font-style:italic">&#8230;</span>&#8221;).  Much evidence was filed by the father to address these concerns:  the evidence included the Joint Report of the Danish Immigration Service / UKBA fact-finding mission to Erbil and Dahuk (2011).  Their investigations revealed that there had been no major security incidents in Kurdistan since 2007.  The Iraq Bulletin (2013) published by the Home Office confirmed that the Kurdistan Region of Iraq remained &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">largely free of violence</span>&#8221; in the relevant period (late 2012), although it was still felt to remain &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a potential target for terrorist operations&#8230;</span>&#8221;.  There was indeed one attack on an Interior Ministry building in Erbil in 2013, which appears (from the other reports which I have read, and the lack of subsequent incident) to have been isolated.  On the information provided, many foreign state observers consider that the country is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">safe</span>&#8221;.</p>

They describe Kurdistan as having a strong local ethnic solidarity, a region which is infinitely more stable than it was during the era of Saddam Hussein&#8217;s rule, and in the immediate aftermath of his fall. Kurdistan is now a relatively prosperous region of Iraq; the ancient city of Erbil is thriving, and a growing centre for commerce in the region.  There is a large number of highly qualified professionals from central and southern Iraq settling there because of its reputation for business (oil-fields lie within its borders) and tourism.  Within the last year, the Kurdistan Parliament formally ratified a Child Protection law designed to improve the welfare of Kurdish children.   It appears, in short, to be a very different from the place which the father left 12 years ago.</p>

The father&#8217;s position was explored during the hearing; in his oral evidence he bared a mind tortured by the irresolvable dilemma of his competing family commitments.  The father explained with considerable sadness and exasperation, how he had been frustrated in his efforts to bring his wife to this country, yet feared being unable to relocate with his son to Kurdistan.  Indeed, he turned to me during his evidence and directly asked me to decide for him what he, the father, should do in these impossibly difficult circumstances; I made clear that I could not make that decision for him.  </p>

The local authority had indicated in the clearest terms that it would not support L remaining with his grandparents if L were left here by his father, would seek to persuade the court that this outcome would be likely to cause L significant harm, and would seek a care order, a course to which the guardian had signalled her support.  The father initially indicated that if I refused permission for L to relocate abroad, then L should live with the maternal family; the father later modified his position to reflect a wish that L should in these circumstances reside in foster care.  </p>

Concern has also more recently been expressed that the grandparents had allowed standards to slip while L was in their care &#8211; not ensuring that he had clean clothes, nor allowing him to sleep in his own bed (L slept in bed with his grandparents, notwithstanding that they had been repeatedly asked by social services to ensure that L had his own bed).</p>

Concerns about the father&#8217;s practice of taking L to work with him at the fast-food outlet on some evenings of school days were readily acknowledged by the father and swiftly corrected; the father referred to the fact that he had a limited support network in this country to assist him with appropriate babysitting; the arrangement by which the father left L with the mother and grandparents on some evenings came to an end.  The father will have working commitments with more sociable hours in Kurdistan, and a wider support network;</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">I have obviously considered carefully the &#8216;capability&#8217; of the grandparents to care for L.  The evidence, including the independent evidence of Mr. Greenhalgh the independent social worker, is that they would struggle to offer L the quality of care which he needs, particularly for the balance of L&#8217;s childhood;</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">In fact, it seemed to me that if the father were to have left L in this country, and relocated himself, L would be devastated.  This would, in my judgment, be likely to manifest itself in distressed and challenging behaviour.  As a consequence L would not be likely to settle easily in any placement; he would need an unusually competent standard of parenting.  In my judgment, the grandparents would have struggled to manage a young boy, playing out destructive or other similar behaviours, while he grieved for his father.  If they found it difficult to care for L, and failed, L would be exposed to further disruption and loss which would aggravate his already strong sense of disruption and abandonment.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Cultural issues: L is a boy with a rich mixed heritage.  Whether here or in Kurdistan, it is important that respect is paid to both sides of his cultural inheritance.  The father complains that the maternal family have been dismissive of L&#8217;s cultural mix, and indeed have been racist and shown animosity towards him.  The maternal family&#8217;s hostile and denigrating attitude to the father&#8217;s Iraqi heritage have been referred to above (see [53]).  It is a matter of some anxiety that these views may re-surface.</p>

In Kurdistan, by contrast, the father has considerable emotional and practical support available to him.  While L will benefit from the support of the paternal family, he will sadly lose the immediacy of a relationship with, and regularity of care by, his maternal grandparents</p>

That said, I feel confident that with the benefit of loving care from his father, and the commitment to promote the relationship the effects of losing that regular relationship will be significantly mitigated.</p>

L often asked professionals what he should do to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">sort things out</span>&#8221;.  When given the chance to express his view in a neutral setting to a social worker on more than one occasion, (on each occasion without prior notice having been given to the parents, thereby reducing the risk of pressure being placed on him) L reported that he would like to live in Kurdistan; he referred more than once to not loving his mother because she would not let him go.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">L has suffered not inconsiderable disruption in his short life; he has already experienced many losses.  He has regrettably spent more than one year of his life in local authority care.  Whatever the outcome of this litigation, L faces the prospect of suffering additional loss &#8211; either the loss of full-time care by his father, or of the regularity of his contact with his mother and maternal grandparents.  In determining this application, I was in very large measure engaged in an exercise in the balancing of losses; the balance was, in many ways, reasonably evenly poised.  Whichever way the Gordian knot was to be cut, one party would inevitably feel themselves to be the losers.</p>

That said, I am satisfied that short-term disruption will be more than compensated by longer term stability for L &#8211; importantly, L will remain in the loving full-time care of his father, who has offered him permanence and consistency, and who has shown a high level of commitment to his upbringing.  The father himself will, I believe, be more settled in his own life, being able to live with his wife, surrounded by his family, and in more stimulating employment; L will benefit from school where his needs can be met.</p>

I do not under-estimate her pain in confronting this life-changing decision for herself and for her son.  In this, she showed great courage, and selflessness. </p>
