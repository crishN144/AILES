	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before proceeding further, it will be convenient to set out the relevant chronology. I can be brief. The proceedings relate to a boy, born in January 2014, and his younger sister, born in March 2016. She was discharged a week later. Five weeks later, on 30 April 2016, she was re-admitted to hospital in critical condition, having suffered life threatening injuries. Local authority and police involvement followed almost immediately. The day after his sister had been admitted to hospital, the boy was placed with his maternal grandparents. The following day the father was charged and remanded in custody; he was released on bail 18 days later. A week later, on 27 May 2016, the local authority began care proceedings in relation to both children. Two months later the girl was released from hospital and placed in foster care. On 22 November 2016, following a fact finding hearing lasting some days, Judge Wood gave judgment: he found that the injuries had been inflicted by the father in circumstances where there was no culpability of the part of the mother. Thereafter the &#8216;welfare&#8217; stage of the care proceedings was delayed because of the ongoing criminal proceedings against both the father and the mother. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Notwithstanding Judge Wood&#8217;s exoneration of the mother, the police and the CPS maintained their decision to prosecute her as well as the father. The trial in the Crown Court which had originally been listed for March 2017 was put back to 16 October 2017. On 27 October 2017 the jury was directed by the judge to enter a not guilty verdict against the mother. On 31 October 2017 the jury reached a verdict of not guilty in relation to the father.</p>

I am told that, despite this, applications to vary her bail conditions were opposed by the prosecution and refused by the Crown Court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In terms of moving the care proceedings on, by the beginning of 2018 the emphasis was on finding suitable accommodation for the mother and the two children. Because of the need to find accommodation, in an area where accommodation is in short supply, that would meet, or could be adapted to meet, her daughter&#8217;s special needs and, moreover, sufficiently close to the mother&#8217;s support network and to the hospital responsible for her daughter&#8217;s ongoing medical care, the search was never going to be easy. One property which had been identified turned out not to be suitable. Despite much endeavour on the part of the local authority, it was not until the last week in May 2018 that what turned out to be a suitable property was found. It was in that state of play that Judge Wood, who had earlier voiced his concerns at a directions hearing on 23 April 2018, at a further hearing on 19 June 2018 made the order to which I have already referred.</p>

By the week commencing 2 July 2018 there was reason to believe that the property which had been identified in May would be both suitable (subject to certain work being done) and available for the mother and her children. On 10 July 2018, two days before the hearing, the mother was given the keys to the property.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances, the primary purpose of the hearing before me had fallen away. Indeed, the parties were agreed that no directions were needed in relation to the accommodation issue. I directed that the final hearing of the care proceedings be listed before Judge Wood on 13 August 2018. My order recited that the local authority &#8220;wishes to do everything possible to support [the mother] in moving into her new home.&#8221; It was common ground that various works required to be done to the property, including the installation of a lift. My order went on to record the local authority&#8217;s indication that the installation of the lift would take approximately four months, and my &#8220;hope &#8230; that the lift &#8230; could be installed by the next hearing.&#8221;</p>

Although by then it seemed that the accommodation issue was well on the way to being resolved, Mr Day indicated that he wished to retain the hearing before me for a rather different purpose, namely to &#8220;look at the wider ramifications of delay in proceedings in the family court&#8221; and, specifically, to address two questions:</p>

If it were thought that the criminal courts had insufficient discretion to enable them to balance the public interest in the welfare of child witnesses, whether or not wards of court, against the public interest in the achievement of justice between the state and the accused, the remedy lies not in the exercise of the wardship jurisdiction, which could only assist wards, but in the conferment of new and wider discretions upon the criminal courts.&#8221;</p>

As the local authority put it in its skeleton argument (prepared by Ms Sarah Woolrich and adopted by Ms Lindsay Webster), &#8220;whilst the decisions of the police and CPS had the effect of creating delay in the family proceedings, those decisions were effectively scrutinised by the criminal court from time to time and were effectively upheld. What business does the family court have in seeking to alter the course of criminal proceedings?&#8221;     </p>

On the contrary, from their point of view the urgent imperative was to bring these very seriously delayed proceedings to as speedy a conclusion as possible. The point was put very pithily in the local authority&#8217;s skeleton argument: &#8220;What is the value of keeping the case running beyond the existing timetable of 116 weeks to resolve a point that does not advance the welfare of the children?&#8221; As the children&#8217;s guardian said, in a position statement prepared by Ms Charlotte Hall, &#8220;Consideration of the questions posed by the mother will not advance the welfare of [the children].&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In my opinion the Court of Appeal was wrong to suggest that a housing authority should intervene in family proceedings to argue against the court making a shared residence order. It will obviously be helpful to a court, in dealing with the question of where the children should reside, to know what accommodation, if any, the housing authority is likely to provide. It should not make a shared residence order unless it appears reasonably likely that both parties will have accommodation in which the children can reside. But the provision of such accommodation is outside the control of the court. It has no power to decide whether the reasons why the housing authority declines to provide such accommodation are good or bad. That is a matter for the housing authority and, if necessary, the county court on appeal. Likewise, it is relevant for the housing authority to know that the court considers that the children should reside with both parents. But the housing authority is not concerned to argue that the court should not make an order to this effect. The order, if made, will only be part of the material which the housing authority takes into account in coming to its decision. The two procedures for deciding different questions must not be allowed to become entangled with each other.&#8221;</p>

It is important, however, to appreciate the limit of the court&#8217;s powers: the only power of the court is either to approve or refuse to approve the care plan put forward by the local authority. The court cannot dictate to the local authority what the care plan is to say. Nor &#8230; does the High Court have any greater power when exercising its inherent jurisdiction.

Without having thought it necessary to require the hapless writer of this astonishing missive to be brought to court to provide an explanation, it would not be fair to assume that this was impertinence or defiance rather than simple ignorance and incompetence; but either way it is deeply troubling that any police force can have thought that this was an appropriate response to an <span style="font-style:italic">order </span>of the court, even if it was a family and not a criminal court. </p>

The criminal <span style="font-style:italic">Protocol and Good Practice Model </span>provides, as has been seen, for the exchange of &#8220;information&#8221;. Much of the time what is required is not so much the provision by the family justice system of <span style="font-style:italic">information</span> about the family court proceedings in the narrow sense but, rather, a more detailed <span style="font-style:italic">explanation</span>, for the benefit of the police or the CPS or the Youth Court or Crown Court, as the case may be, of the family court&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">thinking</span>; of what the family court is trying to achieve, and why; and of the family court&#8217;s objectives for the child and the family, whether in the context of judicial case management or in its detailed care planning. This is not so that the family court can dictate to the criminal justice system &#8211; which, to repeat, is impermissible &#8211; but so as to ensure, as far as possible, that the criminal justice system is aware of the family court&#8217;s thinking; that the criminal justice system can have a better appreciation of whether what it is minded to do will facilitate and &#8216;mesh with&#8217; or will cut across what the family court is doing; and to ensure that the criminal justice system&#8217;s decision-making is less vulnerable to challenge.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><marker name="tab"/>I have in mind the point made by Hoffmann LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte T</span> at 297-8: &#8220;Clearly, any order made or views expressed by the [family] court would be a matter to be taken into account by the Secretary of State in the exercise of his powers. If he simply paid no attention to such an order, he would run the risk of his decision being reviewed [by way of judicial review or appeal] on the ground that he had failed to take all relevant matters into consideration.&#8221; That was said in an immigration context, but the point is of general application. </p>

Sometimes, as in a care case I was recently concerned with, the explanation can appropriately be provided in the form of a memorandum approved by the judge.</p>
