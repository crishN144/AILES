The format of the hearing was that the W, as a litigant in person, had to cross examine the H and was herself cross-examined. There were no special measures put in place. It is accepted by the W that she did not request any special measures. However, not having special measures at the final hearing meant that the W had to cross-examine the H, who she had alleged abused her, and when the W was cross-examined by his counsel, she could see H in the room. </p>

At that hearing the W was represented by a solicitor, Ms Davies. I understand that this further hearing was necessary because the terms of the order could not be agreed even though DJ Parry had set out his conclusions in an oral judgment on 10 September. The final order recorded DJ Parry&#8217;s orders and certain matters as being &#8220;by agreement&#8221;; for example in respect of the child periodical payments order. I note that the order for the sale of the former matrimonial home was not said to be &#8220;by agreement&#8221; and followed from DJ Parry&#8217;s judgment. The order is signed by both parties and their legal representatives. </p>

I understand, although again I have not seen the documents, that the H applied for enforcement of the order, and a few days before the hearing the W made her application to set aside. On 29 August 2020 Dr Schaapveld, a clinical psychologist, produced a report. The scope of that report is very clear as it states at paragraph 1.1:</p>

She reported that she had also received number of &#8220;very aggressive&#8221; correspondences from her ex-husband&#8217;s lawyers and was &#8220;still traumatised&#8221; the Trial. She said she stayed up at night due to acute anxiety. She reported that a work colleague had contacted her and was very concerned about her. She eventually got to sleep at 3am on the day of the hearing. She slept for two hours till 5am. She took a diazepam (5 mg diazepam) 5am and then took another dose at 9am. Between 5am and 9am she checked the bundle of documents. She was highly anxious. [BF] recalled that she went elsewhere to pick up her morning coffee on way to the court for the agreeing of the Consent Order as she &#8220;was worried that he (ex-husband) had arranged for a waitress to put something in my coffee as he had in the past and may have done before the earlier Trial hearing and, I have been drugged before by him". She described her mental state as "completely confused". She met her solicitor and had a coffee. She reported that she was given legal advice that an appeal would be very difficult and she was discouraged from going down this route. She told her solicitor "my mental well-being would not stand an appeal". At the hearing, she felt that she was, "on a conveyor belt, a machine". She remarked "it was almost as if I was watching someone else and not part of it". She reported a feeling of &#8216;de-realisation&#8217; and feeling "numb" for the day. She said she signed the order at the end of the day at 3:30pm. She reported that she didn't read the document thoroughly, and &#8220;&#8230;felt compelled to" sign the document and commented, "I assumed I had no say in anything.&#8221;</span></p>

Due to the abuse she suffered in her marriage and her marriage breakdown, by August 2018 she had sought formal psychological therapy. In October 2019 she was very stressed due to working day and night. On the night before the Consent Order signing she had only slept two hours. Her recollection of the day includes the presence of acute anxiety but also contains elements of paranoid ideation and dissociative phenomena.

My view is that represents an impairment of mind at the material time. Her account of her decision making at the material time indicates that she was most probably not able to understand, retain and weigh up the information before her on the day and lacked the necessary personal autonomy and agency in relation to the decision before her. In this sense her signature on the document in my view most probably does not represent the end product of a decision underpinned by Mental Capacity.&#8221;</span></p>

The report does refer to her having a possible mental disorder before that date, but it is important to have closely in mind that having a mental disorder, let alone being anxious or depressed, does not on its own mean a person does not have mental capacity, see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 2</ref> and 3 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (&#8220;MCA&#8221;).</p>

The argument advanced was that the W had not had capacity in the hearings before DJ Parry. Ms Wilson raised a concern as to whether the W had capacity at the time of the hearing before DJ Solomon. The DJ then suggested that if the W did not have capacity, whether she should report this issue to the Solicitors Regulation Authority. The W apparently told DJ Solomon that the capacity issue only related to the specific date in October 2019 by reason of the stress that she was then under. </p>

But that psychological report, produced by psychologist, not a psychiatrist, not in any of &#8211; anywhere in the report does it refer to the test of capacity. It simply makes some general observations towards the end of that report. Furthermore, you will be aware, I am sure, that in a number of these documents, the grounds of appeal, the skeleton argument, the notes for trial, [BF], on numerous occasions, included when represented, had made references to her health conditions, which I am not minimising, going back for many years. And at no point prior to Monday of this week was there any issue in relation to capacity ever suggested. So, I think your client has a very steep hurdle to overcome to seek to satisfy that an order made over a year ago, or literally a year ago today, on the basis that it is now being suggested that she does not have capacity.&#8221;</span></p>

It did not usher in a brave new world. It was no more than a banal replication of a power vested in the divorce county courts from the moment of their creation in 1968. That power had been confined by the law to the traditional grounds for decades. Interpreting section 31F(6) purposively and with regard to its historical antecedents leads me to conclude clearly that in the field of financial remedies its lawful scope, or reach, starts and ends with the traditional grounds. Mr Feehan QC is not able to point to any kind of emanation from law reformers, or from Parliamentarians at the time that the Crime and Courts Bill was being debated, urging that the time had come to push back the frontiers and to allow far more financial remedy orders to be capable of challenge. Were anyone to have done so I am quite sure that there would have been a chorus of objections that such a reform would open the floodgates to speculative litigation years after the implementation of a clean break and would completely subvert that key principle.</span></p>

The vulnerability in issue impacts on the individual in such a way that there would be a possible breach of natural justice if participatory directions were not made. However, it is a trite proposition that there is no such thing as a technical breach of natural justice and therefore it is necessary in the individual case to consider whether there has been unfairness leading to a breach of natural justice.

In my view these do not amount to good reason for any delay, let alone one as long as in this case. She was represented at the hearing before DJ Solomon, and therefore would have had access to legal advice about either appeal or set aside. The issues that she now seeks to raise were all well known to her. There is no new information of which she was not aware which would justify any delay.</p>

She refers to ill health and having been on holiday, but there is no suggestion that the direct effect of this stretched throughout the period, nor has any medical evidence in support been submitted. The only medical evidence relevant to delay was the hospital discharge summary which indicates she was discharged the same day. She then says she was moving house and was stressed. However sympathetic I might be to the W in having these difficulties, they cannot amount to good grounds to extend time for appeal by 16 months. </p>

To allow an application such as this on the basis of evidence of this type is effectively to drive a coach and horses through the time limits set out in the FPR.  Time limits matter because they impose some finality on proceedings and allow parties to move on with their lives, including their financial affairs. To allow a time limit for appeal to be extended for a prolonged period on the basis of such flimsy evidence would be effectively not to apply a time limit at all. </p>

I come to this position in the full knowledge and consideration of the allegations that have been raised by the W, and her case that she did not have a fair trial because she did not have mental capacity and by reason of the lack of participatory directions. It is however clearly established that even where there is an alleged breach of natural justice, or Article 6, the Court can impose time limits and require them to be abided by. But one example of such a decision is <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ghirea v Moldova App. No 15778/05</span>, where the European Court of Human Rights (&#8220;ECtHR&#8221;) found that the domestic court&#8217;s acceptance of the prosecution&#8217;s appeal out of time, where the limitation period was suspended on account of the prosecutor being on holiday, infringed the principle of legal certainty and violated Article 6(1):</p>

The courts examined the public prosecutor&#8217;s appeal and convicted the applicant, thus altering a legal situation that had become final. The reopening of the proceedings, leading to the quashing of a final decision in the applicant&#8217;s favour, undermined the principle of legal certainty (see Dacia SRL, cited above, &#167; 77). </span></p>

The W did appeal, and HHJ Rowland refused permission to appeal. A hearing that proceeded in circumstances where one party lacked mental capacity would be an error of law and would therefore fall under the right of appeal rather than the power to set aside in FPR9A.

This is an appeal and the test is therefore whether DJ Solomon&#8217;s decisions was &#8220;wrong&#8221; or unjust because of serious procedural or other irregularity, see FPR30.12. Her principal reason for not setting aside the decision on the grounds of lack of capacity was that Dr Shaapveld&#8217;s report only purported to say that the W may not have had capacity at the hearing on 24 October 2019. In my view DJ Solomon was plainly correct on this point. Dr Shaapveld&#8217;s report says on a number of occasions that he is addressing capacity at that later date. He makes no reference to capacity at the hearing of 9 September. I do not accept Dr Proudman&#8217;s submission that he must be taken to be also addressing capacity at the earlier hearing given the express language of his report. </p>

Capacity is decision specific and there is a presumption in favour of a person having capacity, see s.1(2) MCA. Dr Shaapveld was focusing not simply on the one specific date, but also on whether the W had capacity to sign the agreement. That is not the same question as whether she had capacity during the earlier hearing and when she was giving evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is highly relevant to the issue of capacity at the earlier hearing that DJ Parry, who was an extremely experienced DJ, did not appear to have any concerns about whether the W had capacity. Although the consideration of whether participatory directions are required in cases where domestic abuse is alleged has developed considerably in the time since DJ Parry&#8217;s hearing, any experienced DJ would have been well aware of the need to consider whether a litigant, and particularly a litigant in person, might not have capacity. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, I agree with DJ Solomon that the fact that the W was continuing to work as a solicitor throughout the period is relevant to whether she had mental capacity. Dr Proudman refers to the evidence that the W was suffering from a mental disorder, or at least the traits thereof, and that she was under a great deal of stress. But there is a significant difference between having a mental disorder and not having capacity to conduct litigation. Very many people with mental disorders still have mental capacity, as is apparent from the fact that many of those detained under the Mental Health Act 1986 continue to have capacity to instruct lawyers. </p>

The caselaw is clear that there is a proactive duty on judges to consider whether special measures are required. The fact that the alleged victim of abuse does not request them, even if represented, does not relieve the judge of that proactive duty, see the caselaw cited above.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In determining whether the absence of special measures should lead to the overturning of a decision, it is useful to analyse what the legal reason is for the measures. Participation directions are needed to ensure that an alleged (or determined) victim of domestic abuse has a fair trial, or to put it alternatively, that there is no breach of Article 6. Even if it is accepted that in principle it would have been appropriate for the Court to have put in place such measures, the legal question must be whether the failure to do so amounted to a breach of natural justice. In determining that question, it is necessary to have regard to the particular issues in the case and the relevance of the absence of the special measures. As Peel J put it in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">GK v PR</span>, much depends on the context of the case. It is plain from [66] of Judd J&#8217;s decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">L v M </span>that crucial to her decision to allow the appeal was the fact that the allegations of domestic abuse and the need for the Mother to give her best evidence with the benefit of special measures was absolutely central to the issues in the case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The present case is quite different. There is nothing to suggest that there was an unjust outcome, or that the lack of special measures would have had any impact on the outcome. As Mr Nosworthy says, in the context of a fairly standard financial remedies dispute, this was a very standard and expected outcome, namely that the former matrimonial home would be sold. There is in my view an important difference between this case and the cases cited by Dr Proudman. They were all cases where the allegations of domestic abuse were central to the issues that the judges (at first instance) had to decide. That was not the case before DJ Parry. DJ Khan had already ruled that neither party could rely on &#8220;conduct&#8221;. The allegations of domestic abuse, although doubtless of the greatest importance to the W, were at best tangential to the issues DJ Parry had to decide. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Proudman submits that special measures may be just as important in a financial remedies case where it may be the same parties as in a Children Act dispute. That may well be correct in some cases, but it does not go to the issue at the heart of this Ground of Appeal. The question must be whether there was a breach of natural justice which would have required DJ Solomon to set aside the earlier decision and which led to an unjust outcome.  Dr Proudman&#8217;s submissions come very close to the proposition that wherever there is a case where special measures would have been appropriate and they have not been imposed, that should lead to the decision being set aside. But that is not the correct approach. It is only if the lack of special measures led to a breach of natural justice, which itself impacted on the outcome of the case, that a decision might be set aside. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, and in any event, I agree with Mr Nosworthy, that these are issues that should have been raised in the appeal before HHJ Rowland. There is some tension in the caselaw under FPR9A and the degree to which a Ground could go beyond the four categories referred to in PD9A paragraph 13.5. However, both the Grounds here are ones that were well known to the W at the time of the appeal, both amount to alleged errors of law, and yet neither were raised. In those circumstances they are issues that should have been raised on appeal. </p>
