	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">On 19 April 2016 a four month old child, M, suffered a catastrophic collapse at the home which she shared with her parents.  At the time she was in the sole care of her father in a bedroom at the property.  She stopped breathing for a period of about six minutes and had to be revived on a table in the kitchen where her father administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  She was taken to hospital by ambulance following a 999 call which was made by her mother.   She was subsequently found to have a number of injuries including extensive bilateral, multilayer retinal haemorrhaging; fresh subdural haemorrhages in all three intracranial compartments; and a moderate degree of encephalopathy.  In addition, there were a number of petechial bruises on her body which were mapped and charted on photographs.  These were considered by her treating clinicians at the time to be related to the brain injury she had sustained.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Over the course of ten days, I have been dealing with a fact finding enquiry into the cause of those injuries.  The local authority now shares parental authority for M as a result of an interim care order which was made the day after M&#8217;s admission to hospital.  It is accepted by the local authority that M&#8217;s mother played no part in causing these injuries to her daughter.  The issue which I have to determine is whether and, if so, to what extent, they were caused by M&#8217;s father who had sole charge of his daughter when she suffered the sudden and potentially fatal collapse on 19 April 2016.  He denies doing anything which might have caused M&#8217;s injuries.  Because of the course which this litigation has taken, we are some eighteen months further on in terms of planning for M&#8217;s future.  Happily, she has made what appears to be a complete recovery from her injuries and the prognosis for the future is good.  That has come as a huge relief to each of her parents for whom I accept the shock of the events of 19 April 2016 continues to resonate.  Although she spent almost six months in a temporary foster placement following her discharge from hospital, M was returned to the care of her mother in October last year (2016).  There she has thrived and is apparently flourishing in the home which she currently shares with her mother and her maternal grandparents.</span></p>

For the time being, and until there has been a final resolution of the ongoing care proceedings, M&#8217;s grandmother is present during M&#8217;s periods of contact with her father.  That is a position which has been approved by the local authority which acknowledges the extent of the attachment which M has with her father.  The parents have reunited as a couple.  Although they do not live together at present, they wish to pursue a family life within which they can share a home with M and raise their daughter as normal parents free from the present constraints which the current care proceedings have generated.  The local authority has not ruled that out as an option but seeks clear findings in relation to the nature and extent of the father&#8217;s role, if any, in causing the serious injuries which M sustained in April 2016.  The process of formal risk assessment in relation to his future involvement with M is already underway and he has had a number of sessions with a range of professionals who have been instructed to assist the local authority and the court in relation to future planning for M.  Subject to the satisfactory outcome of the work which it is intended both parents should complete, the current care plan envisages the eventual reunification of the family under the auspices of a care order which it is hoped will be of limited duration.</span></p>

Over the course of two weeks in September and October 2016, His Honour Judge Cleary, sitting as a deputy High Court Judge of the Family Division, conducted a fact finding hearing. At its conclusion, the father was exonerated by the judge from any blame in relation to causing M&#8217;s injuries on the basis of a finding that the local authority had failed to prove its case against him on the balance of probabilities.  During that hearing he heard oral evidence from a number of medical experts from different disciplines.  Each had prepared a detailed report about M&#8217;s injuries and the possible cause or causes for her sudden collapse.</span></p>

On 29 March this year, the Court of Appeal handed down judgment.  The leading judgment was given by Lady Justice Black.  Her Ladyship overturned the judgment, set aside the findings of fact, and directed that the matter should be remitted for a fresh hearing wherein the facts relating to the causation of M&#8217;s injuries could be considered de novo.  The judgment is reported as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">D (A Child) </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2017/196" uk:canonical="[2017] EWCA Civ 196" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWCA Civ 196</ref>.  In terms, the Court of Appeal found that the judge had failed to carry out an overall analysis of the medical evidence such as would have enabled him properly to balance his conclusions in relation to the expert evidence against the lay evidence as to the events leading up to the collapse of M whilst in her father&#8217;s sole care.</span></p>

However, by that stage, the parents had identified as a possible cause for M&#8217;s presentation on 19 April 2016 a gene deficiency or abnormality associated with a condition known as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS).  Dr Anand Saggar, a consultant in Clinical Genetics, had reviewed the case on instructions from the father&#8217;s solicitors.  On the basis of the maternal family medical history which was suggestive of easy bruising, he strongly recommended that a connective tissue panel gene test was undertaken to ascertain whether or not M carried genes associated with COL4A1 related disorders, including vascular EDS.</span></p>

Because Dr Saggar had agreed to undertake this work rapidly, and on the basis that M was by then reunited with her parents and in her mother&#8217;s full-time care, I allowed a short adjournment in order that the test could be undertaken.  The local authority did not seek to oppose that adjournment.  It shared the view of the Guardian: if M did indeed suffer from a genetic disorder which might provide an alternative explanation for the petechial bruising and/or which might cast some light on the cause of the subdural brain and/or retinal haemorrhages which were identified following M&#8217;s admission to hospital, then it was in her interests for that to be established.</span></p>

The local authority was directed to produce an agreed composite schedule of the medical evidence with input from the mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s legal teams.  That schedule, together with two bundles of written transcripts, has been agreed and is before the court.  The advocates in the case have worked together to agree a detailed chronology of the events leading up to M&#8217;s admission to hospital last year and developments thereafter.</span></p>

In addition to all the material which was before the court at the earlier fact finding hearing, I had the report from Dr Saggar (to which I have referred above).  I had detailed reports from two psychologists.  Dr Tanya Garrett, a clinical forensic psychologist, carried out a risk assessment of the father.  Her report was prepared in July 2017. She has attended court to give evidence in relation to her ongoing assessment of the father.  Dr Jane Cornwall, a chartered counselling psychologist, was instructed by the local authority to work with the father on a therapeutic basis.  Her report, completed shortly before this hearing, is the result of six sessions which she has undertaken with him on a one to one basis.  I have read an earlier parenting assessment carried out in September 2016 by Victoria Robinson.</span></p>

As I made plain to the parents, I am not conducting a review of the decision made by His Honour Judge Cleary.  That task has already been performed by the Court of Appeal.  I start with a completely clean sheet.  Whilst I have not had the benefit of hearing directly from the medical experts who have been involved in the case, I have read with great care the full transcripts of their evidence, including the robust cross-examination to which each has already been subjected, and responded.  The professional credentials of the expert witnesses in this case are unimpeachable.  Each of the medical experts who was called is recognised as pre-eminent in his respective field of expertise.  Each has confirmed that he has nothing to add to the evidence which is already before the court in the transcripts.  They are agreed to be a complete and accurate record of the evidence which was given in the first fact finding hearing. None of the advocates in the case wished to ask any additional questions save those which have already been put in writing to the experts.  Thus, whilst I have not had the advantage of listening to the expert evidence at first hand, I have had the benefit of being able to read and carefully digest the expert evidence without the need to transpose that evidence into writing.</span></p>

The father gave his evidence over the course of two (incomplete) days.  In the context of the wide canvas of evidence which is now before the court, I know a great deal about the father&#8217;s background and his early and adolescent experience of life as a result of his own reportage to Dr Garrett.  I was able to observe his demeanour whilst he continued to maintain that he did nothing on 19 April 2016 or at any point before that date which might have caused or contributed to the collapse of his daughter in such distressing circumstances.  To the extent that he was probably instrumental in saving her life by his swift actions in administering effective CPR after her collapse, I accept that the events of that day have left a deep psychological impression upon him.  However, my task in the context of fact finding is not focused on what happened after M&#8217;s collapse; rather it is focused on the origin or origins of that potentially life threatening event.</span></p>

Nonetheless, he appears to accept that he must shoulder some of the responsibility for the loss of contact.

She, too, is a Lithuanian national.  When she met the father in 2013, she had recently experienced the loss of miscarriage.  Her previous relationship had ended and, initially, she formed a platonic friendship with the father.  She describes them as &#8220;really good friends&#8221; over a two year period.  In April 2015, their friendship developed into a more intimate bond.  They commenced a sexual relationship.  The circumstances in which those developments occurred are not entirely clear.  The father told Dr Garrett that the mother had never fully recovered from her miscarriage.  She wanted a child but had no partner.  On the father&#8217;s case, they appear to have agreed to have sexual intercourse in order that she might become pregnant.  Once the pregnancy was confirmed, however, they decided they would &#8220;be a family&#8221;.  However, all was not entirely well.  The father had sexual intercourse with another woman on two occasions.  The first occurred whilst the mother was in the later stages of pregnancy and the second following M&#8217;s birth.  </span></p>

Even prior to her discovery of the father&#8217;s infidelity on Christmas Eve 2015, it is clear to me that their personal relationship was neither committed nor stable.  It appears that they separated in October 2015 and the mother was subsequently to tell the police that they had in fact ended their relationship as a couple some nine or ten times over the previous six months.  In November 2015, M&#8217;s maternal grandfather arrived in England from Lithuania in order to provide the mother, his daughter, with some moral and practical support in the latter stages of her pregnancy.  He moved into the mother&#8217;s rented property.  The &#8220;on off&#8221; nature of the relationship appears to have continued after she moved into the father&#8217;s accommodation shortly before M&#8217;s birth.  That accommodation was a house which was divided into six separate &#8220;bedsits&#8221; or studio rooms with shared or communal kitchen and bathroom facilities.  There were no other &#8220;families&#8221; with children living in that property, albeit that one of the other rooms was occupied by the father&#8217;s brother and his girlfriend. </span></p>

He was working six nights a week and was thus absent throughout the nights and asleep for part of the day.  The mother continued to report to the health visitor her wish to move to separate accommodation and there is an entry in the records at the beginning of March 2016 expressing her concerns about her current housing arrangements.  She confirmed at that point that she and the father were separated but co-existing reasonably amicably in the room they continued to share.  The mother told me that she would spend significant parts of her days with M away from the property although M would always be put to bed in her Moses basket in the room she shared with the father.  Apart from the kitchen and bathroom facilities at the property, there were no other communal rooms available to the residents and it seems that mother and child spent time in the father&#8217;s room at various points in the day watching the television whilst he rested or slept before leaving for his night shifts.</span></p>

It was certainly unsettled.  Indeed, it became apparent during the course of their oral evidence that each may have had slightly different expectations in terms of the direction of travel of their relationship and for the prospects of a shared life together in the future.  The mother told me in her oral evidence that she regarded them as a couple prior to her discovery in December 2015 of the father&#8217;s infidelity, albeit that they argued frequently.  By the beginning of 2016 and throughout the period prior to the events of 19 April 2016, she described a situation where they were &#8220;occupying the same space rather than living as partners&#8221;.  Whilst she had been at pains to stress that the father treated her decently and they remained friends, there is also evidence in the papers (which she confirmed during her oral evidence) that there was a period when they hardly to spoke to one another for over a month, albeit that they continued to occupy the same room.  Perhaps it was the father&#8217;s absence throughout the weekday nights which made this arrangement tenable from the mother&#8217;s point of view.  I know not and I do not speculate, but she told me that there were frequent and continuing arguments between them.  What I do know is that even before M&#8217;s birth, the mother had made an application to be rehoused and that application was live and ongoing throughout the weeks leading up to 19 April 2016.  She confirmed that there were tensions between them over the father&#8217;s apparent lack of involvement in M&#8217;s day to day care.  As she put it to me,</span></p>

Her case has always been that the father was aware from the outset that she had made an application for rehousing and had supported her wish to move on the basis that she had made it plain he could see M whenever he wished.  She said that his support for those plans was evidenced by his offer to help her with the practical side of moving and to assist with any decoration which was required when she found a new home.</span></p>

When the mother was interviewed by the police the day after M&#8217;s admission into hospital, she was asked about the logged police call on 21 August 2016 and the father&#8217;s temperament.

His involvement in the routine child care appears to have increased as M became older and the mother described how, whilst she was unsettled during teething, he would often take the baby and tell her to take a break whilst he looked after the child.  That said, it appears to be common ground that he did not have a great deal of experience when it came to handling M whilst she was fractious or teething.

On 19 August this year (2017) whilst these proceedings were ongoing, the mother and father went out on a Saturday night to a club in their local town centre.  They were involved in an altercation with others in the early hours of Sunday morning (20 August).  These events were recorded on a closed circuit TV camera.  The police attended and I have statements from the two police officers who arrested the father.  I have also watched the CCTV footage taken on that night.  It shows the parents, both in a state of apparent intoxication, involved in a confrontation with a group of youths.  The mother can be seen staggering before collapsing into the doorway of a local shop.  It is agreed by the advocates that, before falling, she had hit her head.  The father can be seen standing over her. As the other youths passed by, he smashed his fist into the side window of the shopfront.  The glass broke.  The father injured his hand which was observed by the police officers to be bleeding.  When he was searched after being handcuffed by the police, a pill was found in his pocket which was tested and confirmed to be methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA, more commonly known as &#8216;Ecstasy&#8217;).  To the father&#8217;s credit, he had volunteered to the police that he was in possession of a pill which he had acquired in the night club.  The mother, when asked about this, told police that the father had lent someone his mobile telephone in the club and the pill might have been handed back to the father when his &#8216;phone was returned.  Whether or not that was her honest belief, it is nonetheless an explanation which appears to be inconsistent with the father&#8217;s volunteering this information when confronted by the police with the prospect of a search of his person</span></p>

The information only came to light when the father said in his oral evidence that he had moved home and was currently living at a different address with his brother and his girlfriend.  This caused the local authority to instigate further enquiries as a result of which the social worker, Miss OH, was informed by the police about the arrest and the events which had unfolded over the course of 20 August 2017.  The father said that he had informed the local authority about his change of address although he did not seek to suggest that the social worker knew about his most recent arrest.  Whilst I did not hear direct evidence from the social worker, I accept through Mr Sampson her instructions to him that she had been completely unaware of either prior to making her enquiries of the police in the middle of this hearing.  When she spoke to the father subsequently about these events, he told the social worker that he had punched the shop window &#8220;to scare the lads away&#8221;.  </span></p>

He was able to acknowledge to her that it had been helpful for him to gain some insight and understanding into his current psychological issues.  He reported that the mother had found him &#8220;calmer&#8221; since he had engaged in therapy.  However, in her most recent discussion with Dr Garrett, Dr Cornwall acknowledged that he had a tendency to try to justify his behaviour rather than accepting responsibility for his actions.  She took the view that he had a tendency &#8220;to compartmentalise&#8221; events and was &#8220;psychologically well defended against his emotions&#8221;.</span></p>

She confirmed during the course of her oral evidence that she had not been made aware of these matters prior to attending court.  As a result arrangements were made at court for her to view the CCTV video evidence.  She watched the footage twice.  She told me that the father&#8217;s account did not sit happily with what she had observed.  Dr Garrett&#8217;s observations accord with my own. As I have already observed, he told the police that he had punched the window to scare the youths who had, on his case, been threatening them.  It appears, on the contrary, that he was trying to engage the youths in a fight but was prevented from doing so by the mother who was pulling him away.  Dr Garrett saw this as further evidence of &#8220;impulsivity&#8221; on his part.  It reinforced her concerns that the father had a tendency to allow matters to escalate when confronted by potentially challenging situations and has not yet learned to diffuse tensions by walking away.</span></p>

It is important to stress that the father&#8217;s self-reportage to Dr Garrett and his previous involvement in violent altercations is not evidence which can, or should, lead to the conclusion that he was in some way responsible for causing harm to M.  The father has made it plain that he will always spring to the defence of family or friends if he believes they are under threat.  There were aspects of his childhood which were plainly difficult.  He accepts that he fell in with the wrong crowd when he was an adolescent.  He has suffered significant distress at the recent loss of his father.  The fact that he has been able to discuss these issues with Dr Garrett whilst knowing himself to be under scrutiny in these proceedings is a very positive indicator.  The parents are now presenting a united front in terms of the restoration of their personal relationship and their ongoing commitment to one another.  However, that was not how matters between them stood eighteen months ago when M sustained her near fatal collapse.  Whatever perceptions the father may then have had about the state of the relationship between them, it is clear to me, and I so find, that, as of 19 April 2016 when M sustained the injuries I have recorded, the mother&#8217;s clear intention was to leave the home she shared with the father and move into separate accommodation of her own.  That much is clear from the events which occurred in the hours leading up to M&#8217;s collapse.</span></p>

The following facts surrounding that day are not in dispute.  The maternal grandmother had planned to return home to Lithuania and the mother had offered to accompany her to the airport where she was due to board an early flight.  M was woken at 4am for an early morning feed.  The mother left the house with M shortly after 5am. She was accompanied by IO, the girlfriend of the father&#8217;s brother who was also a resident in the property which they shared with others.  The two women knew one another and IO had been living at the property since before the birth of M. Some thirty minutes later, all four were on a train to the local airport.  Having said goodbye at the airport, the mother, M and IO took a train back to their home town and arrived at the property shortly before 8am.  The father returned from work and, on his case, all three of them took the opportunity to sleep.   The mother&#8217;s evidence is that she went to a local shop to pick up something she needed leaving M in the father&#8217;s care for a short while.  The child was sleeping when she returned but woke shortly thereafter.  After playing with her mother, she was returned to her Moses basket and all three slept until approximately 11am when the mother went down to the kitchen to make up a bottle for M&#8217;s next feed.</span></p>

At some point during the day, the mother received a telephone call from a local authority housing officer.  I was left with no clear impression about precisely when the incoming call was made.  At one point she appeared to suggest that she returned the call straightaway.  We know that her own call was made shortly before 5pm.   In the first fact finding hearing, she told the judge that she had received the voicemail shortly before lunchtime.  In any event, she was anxious to speak to the caller from the housing officer before the office closed for the day.  During the course of that telephone call, she was told that separate accommodation had become available and she, with M, would be able to take up occupation shortly.  She was invited to view the new flat at the end of the week. She shared this news with IO.    Although there is no evidence of a specific discussion on that afternoon between M&#8217;s parents about the proposal for an imminent move, she told Mr Vater QC, leading counsel for the father, that he was fully supportive of that plan.  She said that the news that she was moving out would not in any event have created a situation of stress since he had previously offered his support for the move.  She told me that she was conscious that it was not feasible for all three of them to continue living in what was effectively </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;a bedsit&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">(to use the mother&#8217;s term) and, by implication, she appeared to suggest that he held a similar view.</span></p>

He was with M throughout.  On neither occasion did she notice anything which caused her concern in relation to M&#8217;s presentation.  She took the father a cup of coffee.  M was lying on his knees whilst he was propped up on pillows on the bed.  She demonstrated to me how he was moving his legs, bent at the knees, from side to side in an attempt to settle M whilst he watched television.  M appeared quite content.  She went up to the room a few minutes later to tell the father that she had forgotten to turn on the oven and the roast chicken which she was preparing for their supper would be slightly later than planned.  This last visit to the bedroom appears to have taken place about ten to fifteen minutes before the child&#8217;s collapse.  Neither of the child&#8217;s parents says that she was anything other than completely well at that point in time.  The evidence points to her being unsettled but certainly not unwell; the father appears to have brushed off in a seemingly light-hearted manner the mother&#8217;s attempt to soothe M to sleep by stroking her cheek.  That fond gesture on her part appears to have roused M who was then drifting off to sleep on her father&#8217;s knees.  The mother described to me how the father was holding his mobile telephone in one hand although he was not speaking to anyone.  The mother suspected he was probably checking his Facebook account or looking at some other social media platform.  That was her last sight of her daughter prior to the child&#8217;s collapse.

He accepts that he knows of nothing which happened before that date which might explain the injuries with which she presented on admission to hospital later that afternoon.  Whilst he supported the genetic testing which was undertaken by Dr Saggar in July this year, he does not seek to challenge the findings of that expert evidence save insofar as the doctor expresses a view as to the likely cause of the injuries which M sustained.   That absence of an explanation is not a failing on his part in the context of the fact finding process on which I am embarked.

It was put to him that M had collapsed in circumstances where he had sole charge of his daughter.  It was made plain to him that the police regarded him as the likely perpetrator in the light of the medical evidence that her injuries were likely to have been non-accidental.  He continued to deny causing her any harm although he accepted that he might have been responsible for the marks to her chest and neck during his attempts to resuscitate the child.

Mr J D confirmed that he had been living in England for about 6 months having come here to provide financial and emotional support for his daughter who was then seven months pregnant.  He was then living with his wife, Mrs JD, at the property which the mother had previously been renting which she had apparently maintained after she moved into the father&#8217;s home shortly before M&#8217;s birth.  He described how he first met the father on the day of his arrival in the UK, 14 November 2015, when he was met by M&#8217;s parents at the airport.  (This struck me as somewhat inconsistent with the mother&#8217;s evidence that she was separated from the father at this point in time and intended to raise her unborn baby as a single parent.  It may be that the two were then on reasonably friendly terms with one another and she wanted to introduce Mr JD to her child&#8217;s father.)  Mr JD described the father as &#8220;a hard worker&#8221; who was always pleasant in his manner.  He told the police he had never seen him angry and had no concerns about his daughter&#8217;s relationship with M&#8217;s father.  That observation was made in the context of what was, on any view, a fairly fleeting acquaintance with the father.  In his police statement Mr JD confirmed that he had only met him twice before M&#8217;s birth:  once on the day of his arrival, the second occasion being the following day when the parents visited him at the mother&#8217;s property where he was staying.  It was Mr JD who accompanied his daughter to hospital in an ambulance when she went into premature spontaneous labour.  He recounts how pleased the father appeared to be when he arrived at the hospital and was able to hold his newly born daughter.  He describes how &#8220;he didn&#8217;t want to let go of the baby&#8221;.  Mr JD was working at the time but he visited the baby and her parents at the father&#8217;s home the day after her birth.  Thereafter he describes how the father was often absent on his visits because of the irregular pattern of his shift work at the time.</span></p>

Of the relationship which his daughter had with M&#8217;s father, Mr JD told the police that he was aware of &#8220;some disagreements&#8221; between them and that his daughter, the mother, was &#8220;moody&#8221; as a result.  By and large, he and his wife chose not to become involved in their personal relationship although he confirmed that he had never witnessed any violence or anger between them or towards M.  </span></p>

She told the police that her daughter had secured academic qualifications in Lithuania but could not find work and accepted an invitation from her cousin to stay with him and find work here in the North of England.  She recounts how the mother met the father in a bar and formed a friendship before, as she puts it, her daughter &#8220;fell in love&#8221; with him.  They were living together by the time M was conceived and, as far as Mrs JD was aware, the father was very pleased to discover her daughter was pregnant.  Mrs JD never observed any rows or arguments between the couple although at this point in time she was still living in Lithuania and maintaining contact with the mother by Skype.   She learned that the couple had separated in September 2015 and that her daughter intended to raise her unborn baby as a single parent.  It was this development which prompted the decision that Mr JD would travel to England to provide support and assistance for their daughter who was then worried that there might be complications in the pregnancy.  Mrs JD confirms that thereafter she and her husband did not seek to interfere in the relationship between the mother and the father.   She recounts that Mr JD told her that the father appeared to be &#8220;in a good mood&#8221; and looking forward to the birth of the baby.  </span></p>

Whilst in the first week after her immunisations she was feeding normally and did not appear to be crying or distressed, Mrs JD said that her granddaughter was &#8220;anxious&#8221;. She also noticed that the baby had &#8220;posseted her food twice in a fountain like manner&#8221;.  However, by the time she travelled with the mother to say goodbye to Mrs JD at the airport in the early morning of 19 April 2016, Mrs JD reports that all appeared well with her granddaughter.

At about 3.30pm, the mother took her from the kitchen and went upstairs to the bedroom they shared with the father.  IO assumed that he must by then have returned to the house because after about five minutes the mother reappeared in the kitchen having left M upstairs.  IO did not see the child again until about 4.30pm when the father rushed into the kitchen carrying the child against his left shoulder.  He stated that M was not breathing and immediately commenced CPR.  The child turned blue but had started breathing again by the time the paramedics arrived.</span></p>

She confirmed that the mother had told her that she was looking for alternative accommodation and that &#8220;the council had found a house for her&#8221;.   I know not what IO made of this information, and I do not speculate, but it appears to be inconsistent with her previous impression of these parents as &#8220;a couple who lived together&#8221; and the fact that the mother had never previously spoken to her about difficulties in their relationship.  For the purposes of this fact finding exercise, perhaps what is of greater significance is her evidence that on the afternoon of 19 April 2016 M presented as perfectly well and happy when she saw her in the kitchen following her return from work at 3pm.

Of the five experts and the two hospital doctors who had expressed a view as to causation in this case, each was of the opinion that the injuries sustained by M were most likely to have been caused by the child having been shaken shortly before she collapsed on 19 April 2016 whilst in the sole care of her father.

When reading a scan which reveals subdural haemorrhaging, the ageing of those findings is estimated by reference to their appearance on the scan; acute blood shows as &#8216;bright&#8217; or &#8216;white&#8217; and older bleeds as &#8216;darker&#8217; or &#8216;grey&#8217;.  A clinician reading the scan may identify bright blood as recent/acute and darker blood as old/chronic.</span></p>

Where there has been a re-bleed, both old and fresh blood can be seen in the same area within the brain with the acute blood being visible within the old bleed.  If however acute blood is seen in a geographically different area of the brain from the darker blood, then that is regarded as indicative of there having been two or more separate episodes of trauma having led to the haemorrhages, of different ages, there being no source of &#8216;old&#8217; blood to generate a &#8216;re-bleed&#8217;.  Each of the treating clinicians were of the view that they were seeing both old and new haemorrhages of different ages indicating separate traumatic incidents rather than a &#8216;re-bleed&#8217;.</span></p>

When the arachnoid membrane is damaged at the time of a head injury, dark cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) can leak from the subarachnoid space into the subdural space and either collect there or dilute acute blood that is present.  It can therefore be the case that what is observed on a scan is not a chronic subdural haemorrhage at all but a mixture of blood and CSF which has a similar grey, dark appearance as is seen in a subdural haemorrhage.  This phenomenon is known as acute traumatic effusion, and is part of an acute or recent injury.</span></p>

As chronic subdural haemorrhages resolve, membranes form within them as part of the healing process.  If these membranes can be seen on a scan, then that is good supportive evidence that what is seen is a chronic subdural haemorrhage and not an acute traumatic effusion.  However, the absence of membranes is not diagnostic of acute traumatic effusion; the experts must draw on other aspects of their findings and indeed their experience and expertise in order to reach a conclusion as to whether what is seen is, or is not, a chronic collection.</span></p>

Further, each was clear that, regardless of whether the darker density in fact revealed chronic subdural haemorrhage or acute traumatic effusion, an explanation would still be required to account for the presence of acute bilateral retinal haemorrhages which were found by Mr Newman to be no more than 17 days old and which, it was accepted by common consent, were unconnected with the subdural haemorrhaging.</span></p>

If what was seen were chronic subdural haemorrhages, rather than acute traumatic effusions, that opened up a line of cross-examination as to whether these may have been birth injuries.  Further, if Mr Richards&#8217; rather than Dr Stoodley&#8217;s observations as to the precise location of blood were accepted then all the acute blood identified on the scans could be attributed to &#8216;re-bleed&#8217; into an old subdural haemorrhage, notwithstanding the clinicians&#8217; reference to more than one incident of trauma.</span></p>

His subsequent failure to factor in the further factor of the retinal haemorrhages identified by Mr Newman as both acute and unconnected to any birth injury or hypothetical &#8216;rebleed&#8217; emanating from a chronic subdural collection had resulted in a flawed approach.  Whilst the judge was entitled to have regard to Mr Newman&#8217;s proper acceptance that the retinal haemorrhaging could not be regarded as a conclusive piece of evidence (&#8216;a trump card&#8217;), he had failed to consider in his judgment what impact the presence of the retinal haemorrhages had upon his overall assessment of causation.</span></p>

His evidence is that the retinal photographs which were taken on 22 April 2016, whilst not of good quality, confirm the clinical findings identified on 20 April 2016 by Dr Fiona Dean.  Mr Newman described those retinal haemorrhages as multi-layered in all four quadrants extending from around the optic disc to beyond the vascular arcades.  The haemorrhages were more numerous in the left eye than in the right.  In his opinion, they cannot be related to the child&#8217;s birth and are likely to have been caused within no more than 17 days prior to their identification (i.e. from 5 April 2016).  Their appearance was, in his view, consistent with having occurred at about the same time M became acutely unwell.  Mr Newman further discounted the possibility that the haemorrhages were caused by a spontaneous re-bleed of a hypothetical chronic subdural collection.  Even if it were to be the case that the sub-dural bleeding which was present on the scans was a re-bleed of a chronic collection, that would not account for the retinal haemorrhaging which he considered to be caused by a trauma of some description.  His evidence was that neither the CPR administered by the father nor the isolated raised intercranial pressure and/or seizures would have been likely to have caused these haemorrhages.  Indeed, he dismissed the possibility as &#8216;very unlikely&#8217;.  There was nothing in his review of the evidence which would explain these haemorrhages on the basis of an underlying disorder or deficiency.  He further ruled out any adverse effects from the immunisation which had occurred some three weeks earlier.  In conclusion, he said, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The retinal haemorrhages as documented are in my opinion not related to minor trauma, vomiting, hypertension, immunisations or raised intercranial pressure.&#8221;  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">As to the likely cause of retinal haemorrhages in a non-specific context, he said this:-</span></p>

Partly caused by the hypoxic and change in the blood vessels&#8217; flow and probably likely due to trauma within the orbit, that&#8217;s behind the eye and where the blood vessels actually go into the eye, and it&#8217;s likely that there is some haemorrhage that occurs within that.&#8221;</span></p>

However, the shake would be likely to require significant force to generate the required motion and anyone who was responsible for such a shake would certainly be aware that his handling of the child in this way was inappropriate.  He told the court that retinal haemorrhaging is present in 80% of non-accidental shaking injuries.  Typically one would observe bleeding within multiple layers of the retina as was the case with M&#8217;s eye injuries.  As he has since explained in his addendum report, these injuries are not by themselves conclusive in terms of causation but they fall to be considered as part of the whole picture.  In Mr Newman&#8217;s opinion, the haemorrhages were most consistent with a shaking or shaking with impact injury.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Mr Richards, the consultant paediatric neurosurgeon, told the court that M&#8217;s presentation on arrival at the hospital and when attended earlier by paramedics indicated a diagnosis of moderate encephalopathy.  In the absence of any identifiable medical disease, a recognised cause of a sudden onset of encephalopathy is a recent episode of head injury. Such an injury might well explain the fresh subdural bleeding which was revealed on the MRI scan which was taken on 22 April 2016, some three days after M&#8217;s sudden collapse.  It was evident from the scan that there was mixed intensity fluid over the surface of all intercranial compartments which was consistent with a recent episode of head injury.  In Mr Richards&#8217; opinion, the combination of (i) the presence of moderate encephalopathy with (ii) the neurological findings (fresh subdural blood in all three intercranial compartments with mixed intensity fluids in these compartments) and (iii) the retinal haemorrhages points to a recent episode of head injury suffered by M as the most likely cause.  He accepted that the fluid seen in the subdural space could be either a mixture of fresh blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or a previous (chronic) subdural haematoma:  radiologically, it was often difficult to tell the two apart.  However, in M&#8217;s case, there were no visible subdural membranes on the scan.  It was his expert opinion that that factor, coupled with the absence of any enlarged head circumference or skull fracture, makes it more likely than not that the fluid which was visible on the scan was an acute traumatic effusion.  In other words, it can be linked organically to the fresh blood and points to a recent head trauma rather than being chronic in its origin.  Whilst he could not rule out the possibility that this was a chronic subdural haematoma, Mr Richard&#8217;s evidence was that the most common cause for such an injury (had it existed) would be a shaking injury which had occurred some weeks earlier.  However, as he explained, given that she appeared asymptomatic and appeared to be an entirely well child in the days and weeks prior to her admission to hospital, he thought it more likely that the darker fluid which was visible on the scans was an acute traumatic effusion.  In his opinion, the point of her collapse on 19 April 2016 was likely to be the point at which she sustained the brain injury.</span></p>

He could find no clinical evidence to suggest that, in this case, a birth related subdural was still present, had increased in size and re-bled.   He was asked about whether the apparent increase in the measurement of M&#8217;s head circumference identified by Dr Cartlidge might be indicative of a pre-existing chronic subdural collection.

He, too, saw no evidence of membranes having formed in the brain.  Whilst he said that this could represent either older blood of at least two or three weeks in terms of age, his expert opinion was that it was more likely to be acute traumatic effusion associated with a recent head injury.  He was able to identify from the CT scan an area which was probably acute subarachnoid haemorrhage in the right frontal area of M&#8217;s brain, an observation which had not been noted by Mr Richards.   Having reviewed the MRI scan, he confirmed the presence of what was likely to be acute blood which was suggestive of an injury which occurred between three and seven days prior to the scan and consistent with 19 April 2016 as being the date of injury.  There were no membranes visible on the MRI scan either which lends support for his opinion that the darker fluid seen in the subdural space was not a chronic collection but was rather the result of acute traumatic effusion.</span></p>

The issue which separated the two experts was the extent to which the dark subdural fluid was anatomically related to the acute blood which was visible on the scans.    In other words, they disagree on where the bright fresh blood is seen and whether it is mingled with the darker fluid or separate from it.  They also disagree on their respective interpretations of the scans as to whether the dark fluid occupies the entirety of the intercranial compartments, including the posterior fossa.  The relevance of this debate between the experts is that if Dr Stoodley is right then it is physiologically unlikely that the acute subdural bleed is linked to any chronic subdural collection as a result of its position in the brain.  Thus, if he is right in his interpretation of the scans, it is more likely than not that the darker fluid is indeed an acute traumatic effusion linked to a recent event and is not a chronic subdural collection.

On a balance of probability in my view the dark collection seen on CT over the frontal convexities on both sides and confirmed on the MRI are more likely to represent acute traumatic effusions [than] chronic subdural haematomas.

Both are agreed that there are no clinical symptoms of a developing chronic subdural such as might become evident with a widening of the sutures or rapid increases in the measurement of M&#8217;s head circumference.  M did not present as a child who had a developing subdural collection.

These parents have already endured one lengthy fact finding hearing and the subsequent journey of this case to the Court of Appeal.  A second fact finding hearing in May this year was postponed to enable them to instruct an expert geneticist.  When it became clear that M&#8217;s injuries could not be explained on the basis of a genetic defect, we have proceeded to this second fact finding hearing.  More than eighteen months have elapsed since M was rushed to hospital as a very unwell child and the father has been interrogated on a number of occasions about what happened to cause her sudden collapse by the police, doctors, the local authority, the lawyers and the mother.

They may arise for a number of reasons.  One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability.  Another is that they are lies told for other reasons.  Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account.  The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.  As memory fades, a desire to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural &#8211; a process that might inelegantly be described as &#8216;story-creep&#8217; &#8211; may occur without any necessary inference of bad faith.&#8221;</span></p>

Those steps are not conducted by reference only to the medical opinion, albeit that there may often be no other relevant evidence as to the existence of injuries and consequent illness.  Causation is different because as to that an important factor is the consideration of how, when and by whom an injury could have been inflicted becomes a necessary part of the analysis.  To take an easy example: if a well-reasoned medical analysis leads to a conclusion that a child&#8217;s airways were blocked at a particular time, but it can be shown from a video, or third party personal surveillance that no one did or could have blocked the child&#8217;s airways during that period, that conclusion has to be revisited.  I make this point because in my view at times the approach of both the local authority and the Guardian in this case came perilously close to an approach which, on the basis of the expert medical evidence, proceeded on the  basis that: &#8216;R&#8217; was the victim of a shaking injury because the medical opinion was that this was the most likely cause of his injuries, and the relevant exercise was to consider whether, given their care, and thus the opportunity they had to so injure &#8216;R&#8217;, the parents could show that they did not injure him.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The injuries which M sustained are likely to have been the result of, or had their origin in, one of the following:  a trauma of some sort; an organic origin such as a disease; or an unknown cause.  The local authority seeks findings that each of the injuries (subdural haemorrhaging, retinal haemorrhaging and encephalopathy) was the result of trauma.  Whilst Mr Sampson accepts that this so-called &#8220;triad&#8221; of injuries can never be conclusive in terms of a diagnosis, the presence of all three different injuries may indicate that M was harmed as a result of some form of shaking injury.  I have to consider the medical evidence and the lay evidence in the round as part and parcel of the wide canvas of evidence which has been put before the court.  However, in relation to the medical evidence, Mr Sampson submits that the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">interrelationship</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> between the injuries is capable of assisting the court in relation to likely causation and timing overall.  In this context it is highly relevant, in my judgment, that the retinal haemorrhages are confirmed by the medical evidence to be unconnected with the subdural haemorrhages and the associated encephalopathy.  The expert medical evidence when taken as a whole points towards the strong probability of these injuries having been sustained as the result of a single shaking episode.  The debate between Mr Richards and Dr Stoodley to which I have already referred (i.e. as to precisely what the scans showed) does not dilute the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">consistency</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> of the expert medical opinion in relation to the likely or probable cause of M&#8217;s injuries to the brain.  Each of these two experts agrees that it is far more likely than not that the darker fluid which each observed was an acute traumatic effusion and not an underlying chronic subdural collection.  In other words, the darker fluid is linked organically to the fresh blood which was observed on the scans and is likely to have been caused by a recent trauma.  Whilst the existence of a chronic (i.e. existing) subdural collection cannot be ruled out conclusively, it is unlikely or, in forensic terms, improbable that it was present on 19 April 2016.  There were no clinical symptoms to support the existence of an underlying chronic condition save for the aberrant head measurement which I am satisfied can be rejected in terms of any probative evidential value.  The mild to moderate encephalopathy which the clinicians observed on M&#8217;s admission to hospital is accepted by the medical expert evidence to be inconsistent with a re-bleed from an existing collection.  In relation to the encephalopathy, Mr Richards and Dr Cartlidge are agreed that the acute subdural bleeding which is linked to M&#8217;s sudden collapse is likely to have occurred in the period immediately prior to that collapse.  M appears to have presented as &#8216;lifeless&#8217; and unconscious a matter of minutes before the mother made the 999 call at 17:39 on 19 April 2016.  Her sudden collapse occurred, as I find, in the bedroom in the moments before the father rushed down the stairs to the kitchen with the child in his arms.</span></p>

Nor, as the experts agree, are they likely to be the result of raised inter-cranial pressure or a spontaneous re-bleed of a chronic subdural collection in the unlikely event that such a collection existed.  In my judgment it is significant there is nothing within M&#8217;s medical records before 19 April 2016 which might be suggestive of any previous trauma or accident which might support the existence of an underlying medical condition.  Neither the parents nor the grandparents (who saw her regularly) suggest that she was anything other than a normal healthy baby, albeit one who was suffering from the usual ailments associated with teething.</span></p>

RW had been a regular visitor at the home since the end of 2015 and her notes of those visits raised no concerns whatsoever once the early difficulties of the baby&#8217;s failure to gain weight were addressed.   She had been discharged from the care of the community midwife on 28 December 2015.  By this stage, M had out on weight and had been observed the previous week looking &#8220;pink and warm&#8221;.

Mr Newman&#8217;s evidence was clear:  none of these potential mechanisms is the likely cause of the injuries inside M&#8217;s eyes and the retinal haemorrhaging which is evident from the retcam images is most consistent with non-accidental trauma.  In other words, in his opinion non-accidental trauma is the most probable cause of these injuries which he confirmed were present in c. 80% (i.e. the clear majority) of babies and children presenting with shaking injuries. I do not disagree with Mr Vater who submits that this statistic does not necessarily preclude a finding that M falls into the 20% of cases where the presence of retinal haemorrhaging is not symptomatic of trauma.  Nevertheless I am searching for the truth in order to establish the facts within the territory of probabilities taking into account the entire vista of the evidence which has been put before the court.</span></p>

The evidence of the mother and IO is that M had been playing happily in the kitchen in her pram that afternoon without any hint or suggestion of the collapse which was to come.  Her maternal grandmother had noted nothing untoward when she saw M earlier that morning during the journey to, and whilst saying goodbye at, the airport.  She reported that M was happy and smiling when she kissed her goodbye.    It therefore follows that, on the balance of probabilities, M sustained the injuries which are described by the medical experts between the time the mother left her after her final visit to the bedroom and the moment when the father left the bedroom to carry his daughter downstairs in an apparently lifeless state.  He told me, and I accept, that she had stopped breathing before he left the bedroom.  For that reason alone, I feel able to discount as improbable the hypothesis which was advanced on his behalf that M might have been injured during the journey down the stairs, either as a result of banging her head on the wall or as a result of being shaken during the father&#8217;s descent.  He did not advance that case in his evidence and his description of the manner in which he was holding the child would suggest that this is little more than speculation.  It is not supported by the expert medical evidence; it is not relied on by the father; and it does not accord with my finding that M&#8217;s injuries and her immediate collapse had occurred prior to her being carried from the bedroom.  Whilst Mr Storey has urged me to consider all possible &#8216;outliers&#8217; as a potential cause of M&#8217;s injuries, the evidence will not support a finding in this case that M&#8217;s collapse resulted from a trauma or injury sustained or exacerbated whilst held in her father&#8217;s arms as he ran down the stairs.</span></p>

There is nevertheless an inconsistency in the detail of the accounts he has given of what transpired in the bedroom on that afternoon.  I have already set out in some detail the accounts which he has given on various occasions but it is worth, here, repeating the substance of those accounts against the background of the medical evidence.  M appeared to be perfectly well when he lifted her off his knees and placed her in the Moses basket.  After a short interval, she started to cry.  He put the dummy in her mouth; she spat it out.  He picked her up and cradled her on his shoulder.  She made a noise which &#8220;sounded like she had water&#8221;, started breathing really deeply and then became floppy and unresponsive.  That was his one and only written account of events which he gave in his statement dated 9 June 2016 some seven weeks after M was admitted to hospital.  He was later to tell the police that she had been &#8216;grumpy&#8217; and had screamed when she first spat out her dummy in the Moses basket.  When he picked her up, she &#8220;coughed&#8221; and &#8220;fainted&#8221;.  He described walking in circles at the bottom of the Moses basket for five to ten minutes before she &#8220;fell asleep really hard&#8221;.  During this interview, he stated that he attempted to place the dummy in her mouth on at least two occasions.</span></p>

I also bear in mind that English is not his first, or mother, tongue.  Whilst I suspect his language skills have improved over the past eighteen months as he has continued to live and work in this country, he is still not fluent in spoken English notwithstanding that he did not feel the need for an interpreter throughout this hearing.   The fact that he accepts that he has a temper and can &#8220;lose it&#8221; quickly is an admission which confirms my own observations.  I saw for myself on the CCTV video evidence taken in August this year how the father can react swiftly and with violence to situations of external stress.  But none of that is evidence of any propensity to behave violently towards a small defenceless baby of 4 months.  His previous antecedent criminal history has never involved the use or threat of violence towards a child and M was plainly a loved child to whom the father felt a deep emotional attachment.  That much is evidenced by his shock at finding he was holding an apparently lifeless child in his arms and his urgent response in his efforts to resuscitate her on the kitchen table.</span></p>

He may have been genuinely fearful of the consequences of some momentary loss of control, if that is indeed what happened, as he sat at the police station under intense scrutiny and questioning after what was probably a fairly sleepless night. </span></p>

She only knew for certain that there was accommodation available for her to view in the hour before M&#8217;s collapse.  None of the practical arrangements for a move had been put in place.  In short, this was not her last night in the property; she was not moving out the next day.  She accepted in cross-examination in this hearing that the &#8216;celebratory meal&#8217; to which was she had referred was, in fact, food which she had previously bought and which was in the refridgerator for that evening&#8217;s meal before she received the call from the local council.    Perhaps this aberration by itself might make little difference in my assessment of the overall credibility or accuracy of the mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s accounts.  However, I am concerned that her evidence in October 2016 during the first fact finding hearing was that she had told the father in the hour before M&#8217;s collapse that she had secured separate accommodation of her own.  There were 34 minutes between the time of her telephone call to the council when the news of the availability of separate accommodation was relayed to her and the time when she made the emergency call to the ambulance service following M&#8217;s collapse.  The transcript of her evidence at that hearing records the following exchange between the mother and Mr Sampson:-</span></p>

He explained that he had been out earlier that morning to help his friend to fix his car.  This appears to be in connection with some scratches or damage to the bodywork.  He said he had returned to the property at about 3.45pm.  In is written statement (June 2016), he said he had gone to bed at 9am after returning from his nightshift and woken at 3pm that afternoon in order to help his friend with the car, that friend having driven round to the property and parked next to the house.  At that point in time, he stated that M and her mother were in the kitchen with IO.  All appeared well; the baby was happy and playing contentedly in her buggy.  Contrary to what he told the police, he said he had gone up to the bedroom first and the mother had subsequently brought M up to him with a bottle before going downstairs to make him a cup of coffee.  Significantly, there is no reference anywhere in the father&#8217;s written or oral evidence or in his police interview to a specific conversation between these parents about the mother having received a telephone call from the council during that crucial hour before M was injured.  His written and oral evidence is silent on the point.  He does not speak of any celebration, planned or otherwise, to mark her departure from the property with M.  He may well have been aware of her wish to find alternative accommodation; he may well have offered to provide some practical support in the event of a physical separation and change of living arrangements.  But I question why he did not mention to anyone in the context of the detailed investigation which followed M&#8217;s admission to hospital that, as a couple, these parents were on the verge of separation.  If the mother&#8217;s evidence is truthful, I find it difficult to believe that he would have forgotten that conversation.</span></p>

The first and obvious point to make is that there is no suggestion whatsoever that the mother was implicated in any way with the injuries which M sustained on 19 April 2016.  That much is accepted by the local authority, the Guardian and by the father.  The next observation to make is that I appreciate that the meaning and nuance of questions may well be lost when put and responded to in a language which was not the first language for either of these parents.  Nevertheless, the substance of their evidence is tolerably clear and, in part, it is both internally and mutually inconsistent.   I struggle to understand why, if there was such a conversation about her imminent removal from the property, the father said nothing about the mother&#8217;s intention to move out with M.  She says that this conversation happened within an hour of the emergency call which she made on the afternoon of 19 April 2016.  I cannot speculate about whether that conversation ever took place or, if it did, what reasons the father might have for not telling me about it.  What I can legitimately collect from all of this evidence, in my judgment, is the fact that during a period of often stressful co-existence over many weeks, there were likely to have been unresolved tensions within the home environment in which all three were living.  The mother had plainly determined to leave the relationship; the father was certainly less than committed to the mother.  Whist he referred to her as &#8220;his missus&#8221; when he was interviewed by the police, he was on any view ambivalent about the relationship.  He had been sexually unfaithful to her when M was little more than a new born infant and was to repeat his infidelity with the same woman in the early part of 2016 during their apparent estrangement as partners.</span></p>

On the other hand, if the mother is telling the truth, it is of concern that the father chose to conceal that knowledge in circumstances where he must have known that the circumstances surrounding M&#8217;s collapse would be the subject of intense scrutiny.</span></p>

The father says that he had told the social worker (whom he accepts he did not like and to whom he had previously referred as &#8220;a bitch&#8221;) that he had moved out of his previous property and was living at a different address with his brother.   I have already accepted that this was not true.  Perhaps of greater significance is the fact that when this information prompted an enquiry by that social worker of the local police, she learned for the first time about the incident which had been captured on CCTV on 20</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">August this year.  The fact that the father had been arrested in connection with charges of criminal damage and possession of a Class A drug was withheld from this court until several days into the hearing.  Neither of the parents had said anything about it to the local authority, the social worker, Dr Garrett or Dr Cornwall.  In the context of the important therapeutic work which was then underway, this was a surprising and concerning omission.  The father has since accepted that he demonstrated impulsive behaviour on that occasion and that he has minimised his account of these events.  For her part, the mother accepts that she did not tell anyone about the incident and was disingenuous in her responses.</span></p>

It was clear to me from a number of his responses to questions put to him that he lacks full insight into the extent to which physical and/or emotional damage which he may have suffered as a child or adolescent has a resonance in the present.  He sees little or no correlation between the history he has given to Drs Garrett and Cornwall and the planning which is now in place for M&#8217;s future although he has recognised that &#8220;opening the box of my past makes me think more about my own future&#8221;.  He told me he thought it was &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; that so much time was being invested in trawling over questions about his past life in Lithuania.  He accepts that he has found it helpful to unburden himself in respect of some of his feelings and emotions to Dr Cornwall; he described it as &#8220;like a rock dropping&#8221;.  He is willing to undergo some relationship work with the mother although he candidly admitted that he was not sure whether this was necessary.  </span></p>

I bear well in mind that it was he who initiated the discussion with Dr Garrett about the extent of his criminal behaviour whilst living in Lithuania, and I take into account the fact that he may well have been fearful of disclosing the information about the August incident because of some perceived threat to the ongoing progress of his rehabilitation with his daughter.  He may well have been concerned that, with this fresh fact finding hearing on the horizon, any admission by him of a further violent outburst or momentary loss of control might have prejudiced his case in relation to his denial of having harmed M.  I know not but any findings I might make as to his potential unreliability as a witness have to be factored into my wider survey of all the other evidence in this case, including the unanimous opinion of the medical experts as to the probable causation of M&#8217;s injuries.</span></p>

That is a proposition which I accept without reservation.  Dr Garrett&#8217;s report lays considerable stress on many of the positive aspects of this father&#8217;s relationship with his daughter.  If the experts are right in their collective conclusions, the case is put no higher by the local authority than that any actions on his part which resulted in harm to M were likely to be totally out of character.  The experts have properly confined their observations, opinions and conclusions to matters which properly fall within the compass of their respective expertise.  I have borne well in mind that I cannot, and must not, submit to the temptation to treat the unanimity of the experts and the absence of an explanation from the father as sufficient proof that he was probably the cause of M&#8217;s injuries.  On behalf of the father, Mr Vater has accepted throughout that the medical evidence points in a single direction and that, in determining the probable cause of M&#8217;s injuries, I must approach the question of probabilities through the prism of the medical evidence.  In terms of the aetiology of these injuries having presented as a result of an &#8220;unknown cause&#8221;, I have reminded myself that I have to give due weight and consideration to the possibility, if not probability, that &#8211; to use Mr Vater&#8217;s words &#8211; this &#8220;might be the one in a million case&#8221;.</span></p>

He submits that I should discount any suggestion that acts of aggression or violence in his past should now be held up as some form of evidence of propensity particularly in circumstances where he has never lost his control with a child, far less a vulnerable infant who is his own child.  In this context he points to the fact that, if relevance is to be attributed to his account to Dr Garrett of the extent of the injuries he has inflicted on his alleged assailants in the past in moments when he has lost control, why did the experts not observe more extensive injuries to M ?</span></p>

The fact the father has some history of fighting with other men, and lashing out in that context, is irrelevant to the fact in issue.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">It seems to me that this is to ignore the basis upon which the local authority puts its case against the father.  It is not alleged that this was a sustained attack by a man in the grip of a violent and uncontrolled rage.   It is said that the probable, or most likely, explanation for M&#8217;s injuries was a momentary loss of control on the father&#8217;s part which resulted in some sort of shaking injury which was sufficient in terms of the biomechanical force deployed to result in the child&#8217;s spontaneous, or near spontaneous, collapse as a result of the injuries which were subsequently observed and documented by the treating clinicians at the hospital.  The presence of the retinal haemorrhages, the subdural bleeds and the encephalopathy is confirmed unanimously by the medical experts.   Mr Vater seeks to persuade me that there is very little evidence that, at the time M sustained these injuries, this was a family under any particular pressure.  I disagree for the reasons I have set out above.  Whilst I accept that these parents were communicating with one another on 19 April 2016, the mother&#8217;s evidence is that she regarded her imminent departure with M to an independent life separate and apart from a shared existence with the father as a cause for &#8216;celebration&#8217;.  Whilst there may at that point in time have been an element of &#8216;civility&#8217; between them, the history of their cohabitation from the later stages of her pregnancy was not a happy one.  The undercurrents and tensions which flowed from the mother&#8217;s distress at the father&#8217;s lack of commitment to her, his admitted infidelity and her unhappiness at the limited role he was prepared to undertake in relation to M&#8217;s care during the early months of the child&#8217;s life point collectively to an unstable and potentially insecure environment for both mother and child.  I do not regard the uninformed observations of others, such as IO, to add much, if any, evidential weight to the clear picture which emerges from a holistic overview of the evidence which I have heard and read.  The maternal grandparents were alive to the difficulties in the relationship but chose not to become involved over and above the support which they were providing in practical terms to the mother and M.  The health professionals were aware of the problems and the potential fracture in the parents&#8217; relationship.  The local housing authority was aware that this mother was seeking accommodation where she might live with her child independently of the father and it plainly regarded her application as having merit in terms of its assessment of her needs at the time. </span></p>

That M sustained the injuries described in the medical expert evidence is not in issue and the father does not seek to challenge the conclusions of the experts in terms of their clinical observations.  The issue at the heart of this case is causation.  I must decide whether they were </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">inflicted </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">injuries and the answer to this question involves a consideration of the range of possible causes for the injuries observed including accident and &#8220;unknown cause&#8221;.  It is in the search for an answer to this latter question that I must look to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">all </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">the evidence which is currently before the court.  The mother is eliminated in terms of a possible perpetrator: that much is agreed.  Thus, if these injuries were </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">inflicted</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, it is only the father who remains as a potential perpetrator.  In circumstances where I have found that his evidence to the court cannot be considered to be entirely reliable or truthful because of inconsistency or the withholding of otherwise relevant information, I must nevertheless go on to assess the probability of an inflicted injury against the competing and positive aspects of his attributes as a parent to M.  My focus in discharging this task must be based on my assessment of the evidence as I find it to be at the time when the injuries occurred.  I have to ask myself whether, taking all the evidence I have considered into account including the expert medical and the lay and circumstantial evidence, this is a case where M&#8217;s injuries were more likely than not to have been caused by a sudden shaking injury, the details of which the father has chosen to withhold from this court.  In discharging this task, I am entitled to examine what the &#8216;constellation&#8217; of expert medical evidence tells me is &#8216;probable&#8217; in the light of the absence of any alternative explanation.  That is not in any sense to impose an evidential burden on the father to provide such an explanation.  Rather, the absence of anything which might explain the cause of M&#8217;s injuries absent some shaking force or movement is a factor which has to be weighed in the scales of my overall assessment of what is likely to have happened on the simple balance of probabilities.</span></p>

I have to bear in mind the nature and extent of the injuries this child sustained and the fact that the retinal haemorrhages which were bilateral and multi-layered were unrelated to the injuries to her brain.   I am not persuaded by Mr Vater&#8217;s argument that the absence of more extensive injuries to other parts of the child&#8217;s body should lead me to conclude that the father can safely be exonerated.  I observe that more or less precisely the same catalogue of &#8220;missing injuries&#8221; did not prevent Keehan J from making a finding against the father in the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">A Local Authority v DB, RB and SM </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">(see paragraph 73 of his Lordship&#8217;s judgment).

As I have said, it is no part of the local authority&#8217;s case that this was in any sense a sustained attack but merely a momentary loss of control on the part of the father.  I cannot speculate on precisely what happened.  I do not trespass into the realms of asking myself whether he became frustrated when he could not pacify his fractious child with the dummy when she continued to spit it out.  What I do know is that within the space of no more than a few minutes a child who had up to that point presented as perfectly well had stopped breathing.</span></p>

Their presence, in my judgment, lends weight and value to the evidence of Dr Stoodley, Dr Cartlidge and Mr Richards who are unanimous in their expert assessment of what they were likely to be observing on the scans.  Each has confirmed the view of the others that what they saw are highly likely to be acute traumatic effusions and not evidence of a pre-existing injury.  If acute traumatic effusions were present, that presents the court with reliable and highly persuasive expert evidence and a clear pointer towards the probable, or likely, existence of some form of trauma immediately prior to M&#8217;s collapse.</span></p>

However, when measured against the unreliability of the father&#8217;s evidence and the domestic circumstances of the family at the time, I have reached the clear conclusion that the possibility of these injuries being the result of an unknown cause is sufficiently remote that it can be excluded.  I am satisfied that the most likely, or probable, cause of the injury to M&#8217;s brain was trauma.  On the balance of probabilities, I find that the father inflicted that trauma through some form of shaking.  Such shaking resulted in the subdural bleeds and the multi-layered bilateral retinal haemorrhages which I accept were probably caused at the same time and by the same means, together with the ensuing encephalopathy.  Those injuries were sustained, as I find, at some point during the period when he had sole charge of the child in the ten or fifteen minutes after the mother had left the room and before her 999 call to the ambulance service which was timed at 16:49.  The child most probably sustained these injuries whilst in his care in the bedroom.  Since she had stopped breathing before the father left the bedroom, I discount on the balance of probabilities the possibility that the injuries were caused during his descent down the stairs to the kitchen.  Mr Storey sought to persuade me that the absence of a spinal subdural is significant in this context and points away from the likelihood of a shaking injury and towards harm arising as a result of rotational forces such as might be applied during the father&#8217;s swift run down the stairs.  For reasons I have already explained, I have rejected that theory (and it is no more than that) for the reasons given.  M was already exhibiting symptoms of collapse before she was carried through the bedroom door and the father himself did not seek to run a case that she was somehow injured as he carried her down the stairs.   It follows that I reject as implausible and inherently improbable the father&#8217;s account that this child (who was reportedly well, alert, responsive and making good eye contact whilst her mother was present in the bedroom) would scream, spit out her dummy, cough and immediately collapse &#8220;as if she had no bones&#8221; </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">and </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">would subsequently present at the hospital less than an hour later with serious brain and retinal injuries (albeit that those injuries were only confirmed in the hours subsequent to her admission). </span></p>

I take the view that a final care order is now both proportionate and necessary to protect and promote M&#8217;s welfare and her best interests.  The present intention is that a final assessment should be undertaken prior to the next LAC review which is scheduled for February 2018.

Looking to the future, Miss Shaw has remarked on the distress which M is reported to experience when the father leaves the family home after seeing his daughter.  She was encouraged by the meeting which she had at court on 7 November 2016 with Dr Garrett and the social worker.  Through counsel, Mr Turner, she has expressed to the court her view that Dr Garrett&#8217;s ongoing intervention in these proceedings has provided both clarity and direction in terms of future progress.

That is much to their credit.  It is work which is needed in my judgment.  Despite the chequered history of their relationship, they presented in court as a united couple who intend to make a future together with their child.  If they succeed in that ambition, it will be very much in M&#8217;s interests to grow up in a home which she shares with both parents without the need for further external intervention.  However, it is important that the parents maintain their commitment to the work which lies ahead.  I am conscious of the fact that they have yet to experience a shared life together under the same roof in the context of a stable and settled relationship.  The counselling which has been recommended to assist them in terms of the previous difficulties in their relationship will be vital work and each needs to make a personal investment in the support which will be made available.  They need to engage fully with the social workers who will continue to have legal responsibility for M until such time as their involvement with M ceases.  I have been impressed by the highly professional work which has been undertaken to date by the social work team led by Miss OH; it is work which needs to be acknowledged by these parents.  I am satisfied that the local authority&#8217;s commitment to a rehabilitation of this family as a single unit is real.  It has invested time and hard pressed financial resources in the ongoing exercise of that rehabilitation.  If that commitment is matched by these parents, and subject always to a final assessment of risk, I can see no reason why the care order which I am making should not be discharged within the time frame which is envisaged.</span></p>

I hope that she will reflect upon my judgment, my conclusions and the reasons for the findings which I have made.  She had previously expressed her position in different terms:  should findings be made against the father, she intended to raise M in a separate household and end her relationship with him.  I accept that her approach as she explained it to me may well have been informed by the fact that she has been in an ongoing relationship with the father for over 12 months in circumstances where a judge has previously absolved him of any role in the harm which befell their much loved daughter in April 2016.  My reversal of that position will, I know, be difficult for her to absorb, just as it will be for the father.</span></p>
