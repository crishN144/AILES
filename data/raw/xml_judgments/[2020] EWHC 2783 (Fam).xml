The prospective adopters&#8217; account of the circumstances makes for very disturbing reading and it was undoubtedly an exceptionally challenging situation for them and the children.  </p>

In an episode that lasted several hours she bit herself, headbutted floors, doors and walls, gouged her eyes and pulled her hair out. It led eventually to an ambulance having to be called. Not only was this clearly all very distressing for G but also for the prospective adopters and very importantly for M who inevitably witnessed a great deal of G&#8217;s behaviour. Only two days previously the children had been taken to A&amp;E so that M&#8217;s injuries inflicted by G could be assessed, and so that G could be admitted for her own safety and that of M.  </p>

We have had a lovely supportive text from [X], who has been incredible throughout, but I&#8217;m afraid this lack of action from everyone else is just reflective of the way we have been treated throughout. <span style="font-size:11pt">[Y]</span> from CAMHS was very thorough and kind this morning but this is the support we should have had in October when we asked for it. We and the girls have been under incredible stress from that point, and it was impossible to think it could get worse, and in the last four weeks it has. If you are unwilling to act to protect M from G, when the most serious of harm is happening, you are leaving M to live with her abuser and face further harm, and G destroying herself and everyone around her. If you cannot protect us all now at the worst of times, <span style="font-weight:bold">I&#8217;m afraid that is it. We are heartbroken</span>. We are not social workers and the response is not adequate from yourselves. <span style="font-weight:bold">Please come and get the girls. And wherever you place them I beg you separate M from G. We are no longer able to continue.</span> &#8230; NB <span style="font-weight:bold">As I have been writing this email I have seen [Z] has tried to phone 5 minutes ago.

They say that up until this point the children, in particular M, was being voluntarily accommodated by the local authority with their consent.

In the words of counsel for the local authority it was either both of the children or neither of the children. In the context of the ever-deteriorating behaviour from G and the crisis between 18 and 21 July 2020 it is clear that the prospective adopters had finally reached the conclusion that it was best for them to care for neither of the children rather than to continue caring for both children together. This explains why they now asked for M, who was far less challenging, to be cared for by the local authority as well as G;  </p>

Evidently at this time the local authority was still hoping that the situation could be salvaged in some fashion. This also explains the local authority&#8217;s actions in subsequently continuing to involve the prospective adopters in decisions regarding the children and in facilitating contact with them. It does not, however, detract from the undoubted fact that on 21 July 2020 the prospective adopters had given notice to return permanently the children;  </p>

Were it to do so then judicial review would be available. The grounds might include familiar public law complaints such as a failure to consult the adoptive parents; or a flawed decision-making process where matters were left out of account; or classic <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> unreasonableness or irrationality. Since the enactment of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> the grounds might expand to include an allegation of breach of Convention rights. Normally such a breach would be pleaded within judicial review proceedings so as to maximise the grounds of challenge, although there is no reason why a human rights claim could not be made free-standingly, as happened in this case. </p>

Equally, in my judgment, where a freestanding human rights application has been made, interim relief could be applied for to seek prevention of the implementation of the notice and the removal of the child. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The scheme is completely logical in circumstances where following a placement order (a) a child has been placed with adoptive parents; (b) the child is actually living with them; but (c) the local authority has decided to end the placement. It is clear, however, that the framers of the legislation did not contemplate the scenario (which, for the purposes of this part of the judgment I assume to be the case) where the child is not living with the adoptive parents but has been returned to the local authority for a period of respite care.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Assume that during this period of respite care the child made revelations of serious abuse by the adoptive parents. Mr Wilson, counsel for the applicants, argues that in such circumstances the local authority either has to return the child to the adoptive parents and then initiate the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/35" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 35</ref> procedure to get the child back a week later; alternatively the local authority has to apply, in reality against itself, for an emergency protection order or interim care order. I cannot accept this submission which has an air of unreality about it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment, in this scenario it is obvious that the local authority has the power to decide to terminate the placement. As the child is already with the local authority there is no need for notice to be given to the adoptive parents. The local authority therefore just makes the necessary decision. That decision would be challengeable in judicial review proceedings or in freestanding human rights proceedings. That, in effect, is what has happened in this case. The applicants sought the return of M on 14 August 2020. The local authority declined to return her and in making that decision they tacitly made the decision to terminate the placement. That decision is challengeable in the ways I have indicated. The applicants have decided to go down the route of a freestanding human rights application. In this scenario the application would fall to be determined on an interim basis on its merits using the conventional criteria applicable to such applications. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I reject the submission that the local authority has retained M &#8220;unlawfully&#8221; since 14 August 2020. Again, this is a submission which seems to me to be tinged with unreality. The local authority has retained M pursuant to its overarching parental responsibility. The applicants lost their parental responsibility when the local authority made its tacit decision on 14 August 2020. The fact that they later made an adoption application does not alter the legal position. </p>
