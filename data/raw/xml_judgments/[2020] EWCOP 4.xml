	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2019, I heard an application, in the Urgent Applications List, brought jointly by Guys and St Thomas&#8217;s NHS Foundation Trust (GSTT) and the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM). The case concerned the obstetric treatment of R who, on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2019, was 39 weeks and six days in to her pregnancy. R has a diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder which is characterised by psychotic episodes. R was detained in a psychiatric ward which fell within the jurisdiction of the second applicant (SLAM). The first applicant (GSTT) is the Trust responsible for R&#8217;s obstetric care.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Given that R might have entered labour at any moment, I gave my decision in an extempore judgment. Some key facts of the case require to be stated plainly. All the treating clinicians agreed: R had capacity to make decisions as to her ante-natal and obstetric care; there was a substantial risk of a deterioration in R&#8217;s mental health, such that she would likely lose capacity during labour; there was a risk to her physical health, in that she could require an urgent Caesarean section (&#8216;C-section&#8217;) for the safe delivery of her baby but might resist. </p>

	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">For completeness, I should record that the relevant evidence as to capacity incorporated the following: short capacity assessments on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>  June 2019 and 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July 2019 in the SLAM medical records, both stating that R had capacity to consent to or decline antenatal care; a statement by Dr Walker-Tilley, a Consultant Psychiatrist from SLAM, stating his view that R remained capacitous as of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2019, and setting out the evidence in support of the Trusts&#8217; case that there was a high risk of R losing capacity in labour; a statement by Dr Clarke, Consultant Obstetrician at GSTT, confirming her agreement with Dr Walker-Tilley. This factual situation i.e. a capacitous woman who is likely to become incapacitous, during the course of labour is relatively unusual but it is not unprecedented.  </p>

	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The evaluation of the obstetric risk was analysed in the report of Dr Clarke. R was suffering from polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid round the baby); her baby was large, and it was uncertain whether the baby would present head down or be in a transverse, breech, or unstable presentation.  These factors all increased the obstetric risks: continuous monitoring was recommended, and there was a real risk that Csection would be necessary to ensure the safe delivery of the baby. There was also a manifest risk of non-cooperation or resistance by R if the baby required delivery urgently. It is unnecessary for me to identify the particulars of that evidence here, other than to say it was well established by R&#8217;s earlier behaviours.  If a C-section were then to be recommended, it might be required in minutes. Dr Clarke&#8217;s statement included the proposed plan for delivery of the baby, exhibiting an obstetric plan and a plan to manage any physical restraint.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Self-evidently, the Court was in the entirely invidious position of having to determine applications which have an obviously draconian complexion to them, in circumstances which were far from ideal. Moreover, R was unrepresented. Mr Patel QC and his instructing solicitor had stepped in, to seek to protect R&#8217;s interests. I appointed Mr Patel to act as &#8216;Advocate to the Court&#8217;. Neither he nor his solicitor was representing R. The role of Advocate to the Court involves very different obligations and is not to be conflated with the role of the Official Solicitor as litigation friend. </p>

	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">There had not been time to appoint the Official Solicitor nor, for obvious reasons, was there any opportunity to do so. However, self-evidently, a decision had to be made. I was satisfied that the application was well founded and that the declarations contended for met R&#8217;s best interests. I do however deprecate the delay in bringing the application. The delay was avoidable but perhaps not so starkly so as first appeared. It became clear to the applicants, only ten days before the August hearing, that R had stopped taking her anti-psychotic medication. This manifestly required a re-evaluation of the risk and the need to reassess the birth plan.   </p>

It is axiomatic that if anticipatory declarations are to be made relating to the capacitous and which have the effect of authorising intervention and/or deprivation of liberty at some future point where there is unlikely to be recourse to a court (following a subsequent loss of capacity) that should be rooted very securely in law. I have received submissions of the highest quality from both legal teams. </p>

She was cooperative throughout the labour and her healthy child was born by spontaneous vertex vaginal birth. There was, as it transpired and as R had always asserted would be the case, despite the cogent medical concerns, no need for a caesarean. This was her sixth child and such records as were available indicated that C section had not been necessary in the past. I have been told that the police attended and a Police Protection Order (PPO) was issued followed by Local Authority applications for an Emergency Protection Order (EPO) and an Interim Care Order (ICO). </p>

The focus however is, as Keehan J has emphasised, particularly acute in cases such as this. The need for an informed birth plan, identifying the appropriate support required, reviewed by the Court in a way which permits it properly to be scrutinised and facilitative of representation for P is essential. So too, is the need for a fully transparent process, given the fundamental rights and freedoms that are engaged here.  As Keehan J highlights, these rudimentary requirements are a facet of the Article 6 rights of all involved. Moreover, failure to plan in a careful and properly informed manner may jeopardise the health, even the lives of the mother and the unborn baby. Thus, it follows, to my mind, inexorably, the court will need to be involved in a way which anticipates rather than being merely reactive to crisis or emergency. </p>

In this case the application arises in the face of opposition by a woman who, all agree, was capacitous at the time of the application and unrepresented.  It is a profound understatement to say that such a situation should give any court real concern for the autonomy of the individual at the centre of the process. </p>

There are, at least arguably, alternative constructions to be placed on this section. The most striking is that the section has no application at all here and is entirely confined to decision making where <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a person (P) lacks capacity&#8230;&#8221;</span> Alternatively, it is suggested that Section 16 could, whilst precluding the making of an immediate order, nonetheless facilitate the making of a contingency or anticipatory order, which will be triggered only in circumstances where P loses capacity. This latter construction, self-evidently, requires reading the word <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;if&#8221;</span> in </p>

I agree with the logic of her submission. However, as I have already alluded to, the judge did not have the benefit of the detailed argument that I have received. As I read his judgment, I do not think Cobb J heard any argument on the point. All the advocates before him had agreed that a jurisdiction existed, generally, under the aegis of Section 16, 15 or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction. In <span style="font-weight:bold">United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust v CD </span>(supra) Francis J found himself in a strikingly similar position to the one I faced in August. In those circumstances he, like me, did not have time to consider extensive legal arguments. The decision was required quickly. Francis J&#8217;s welfare and legal instincts, led him to the conclusion that either <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 15</ref> or the inherent jurisdictional powers of the High Court provided a sound jurisdictional basis for the intervention sought.  </p>

I am not being asked to authorise medical intervention in relation to a capacitous adult. I am being invited to determine whether, if the adult in question loses capacity, a medical intervention can be authorised which is contrary to her expressed wishes, whilst capacitous. In virtually every application that comes before this Court, relating to medical treatment, the answer to the question posed here would be a resounding &#8216;no&#8217;. There is now a raft of case law, including many of my own judgments, which illustrate the efforts the Court of Protection will go to in order to identify what the likely wishes of P would be, in circumstances where P has lost the capacity for the relevant decision making (see e.g: <span style="font-weight:bold">Cumbria NHS Clinical Commissioning Group v Ms S &amp; Ors <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2016/32" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCOP 32" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCOP 32</ref>; Briggs v Briggs <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2016/53" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCOP 53" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCOP 53</ref>; Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust v Mrs P <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2017/23" uk:canonical="[2017] EWCOP 23" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWCOP 23</ref>; PL v Sutton Commissioning Group <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2017/22" uk:canonical="[2017] EWCOP 22" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWCOP 22</ref></span>). Whilst the identified wishes of P will not in and of themselves be determinative, they will always be given substantial weight and are highly likely to be reflected in the order or declaration the Court makes.

When Parliament legislates to remedy what the majority of its members, at the time, perceive to be a defect or a lacuna in the existing law (whether it be the written law enacted by existing statutes or the unwritten common law as it has been expounded by the Judge&#8217;s in decided cases), the role of the judiciary is confined to ascertaining from the words that Parliament has approved as expressing its intention what that intention was and to giving effect to it. Where the meaning of the statutory words is plain and unambiguous it is not for the judges to invent fancy ambiguities as an excuse for failing to give effect to its plain meaning because they themselves consider that the consequences of doing so would be in expedient, or even unjust or immoral&#8230;&#8221; </span></p>

Many of the cardinal principles that I have referred to above find expression in the earlier case law. A convenient example of this is the recognition within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that capacity might be &#8216;fluctuating&#8217; and, further, that various strategies may be deployed to enable an incapacitous individual to achieve capacity in a particular sphere of decision taking, where properly and appropriately assisted. This may require the salient issues to be distilled into a format which resonate more comfortably with P&#8217;s own experiences in life and his personal characteristics. It may, in different circumstances, involve a change, perhaps even temporarily, to P&#8217;s medical regimen. In another context it may involve the appointment of an intermediary e.g. to assist in achieving capacity to litigate. All this recognises that &#8216;capacity&#8217; is not a static concept. It follows that, inevitably, this Court will find itself involved in situations in which an individual may have capacity to take decisions on some issues but not on others and facing circumstances where P may be </p>

It does not strain the wording of this provision, in any way, to extrapolate that it is apt to apply to circumstances which are foreseeable as well as to those which are current. There is no need at all to diverge from the plain language of the section. In making a declaration that is contingent upon a person losing capacity in the future, the Court is doing no more than emphasising that the anticipated relief will be lawful when and only when P becomes incapacitous. It is at that stage that the full protective regime of the MCA is activated, not before.  </p>

A deprivation of the liberty of any human being will always and self-evidently require scrutiny and vigilance. I agree that these orders may only be made via the above provisions. Parliament plainly intended, for reasons that are obvious, that the granting of such orders would be confined within strict criteria. It strikes me as a distortion not only of the provisions themselves but of the entire framework of the act to contemplate facilitating such draconian restrictions through other and far less obvious channels.  </p>

However, for the reasons I have discussed, at para 16 above, I consider that in these difficult obstetric cases, that is not only unviable but also potentially dangerous. It is not an overstatement to say that the inevitable potential for delay, including for a very short period, may lead to compromise of the health or risk to the life of the mother and unborn child. It is, also, necessary to say that risk to the health or life of the unborn child is, in these circumstances, rarely likely to be in the mother&#8217;s best interests. I say &#8216;rarely&#8217; rather than never because it is possible to contemplate an obstetric crisis which requires a binary choice to be made between the survival of the mother or the unborn child. This is the prism through which this particular aspect of risk must be evaluated. </p>

No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:...(e) the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of unsound mind, alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants..."Article 5(4) provides:"Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful."(7) "...[E]xcept in emergency cases, the individual concerned should not be deprived of his liberty unless he has been reliably shown to be of 'unsound mind'. The very nature of what has to be established before the component national authority - that is, a true mental disorder - calls for objective medical expertise. Further, the mental disorder must be of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement. What is more, the validity of continued confinement depends on the persistence of such a disorder..." Winterwerp v Netherlands [1979] 2 EHRR 387 at [39].(8) </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Under Article 5(4), the lawfulness of the detention has to be reviewed under the principles set out in the Convention.</span><span style="font-style:italic"> It must therefore be wide enough to bear on those conditions that are essential for the lawful detention. In particular, with a view to ascertaining whether there still persists unsoundness of mind of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement: see Winterwerp at [55] and Re PS at [20]. (9) As explained by Munby J in Re SA, the inherent jurisdiction in this context is exercisable not merely where a vulnerable adult is but also where he is reasonably believed to be incapacitated.

All agree that they should be made sparingly. The case law, to which I have referred, emphasises the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;exceptional&#8217; </span>circumstances of the particular cases. However, in the context of the applications that come before Tier 3 (i.e. High Court) judges of the Court of Protection, many cases may properly be described as exceptional. Certainly, the families of those involved would consider them to be so. The cases frequently present issues of medical, moral, legal complexity. The MCA emphasises the importance of identifying P&#8217;s capacity to take individual decisions. The jurisdiction is highly case or fact specific. Against this backdrop it is easy to see that the concept of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;exceptional&#8217;</span> is vulnerable to being corroded i.e. interpreted as having wider application than that which the Court might intend. The right of all individuals to respect for their bodily integrity is a fundamental one. It is every bit the right of the incapacitous as well as the capacitous.  </p>

This order was granted notwithstanding her clearly articulated objections which were rooted in profound religious beliefs. This was the first occasion this issue was considered by the High Court. It was a life and death situation both for the mother and for the unborn child and a decision, once again, was required in minutes rather than hours. It was heard by Sir Stephen Brown, P. as a matter of the utmost urgency. The hearing was, of necessity, short and it was not possible for the mother to be represented. So many of these applications, of which this one is typical, have required to be dealt with in circumstances which have not provided proper opportunity for these very complex ethical issues to be analysed with the care that they require. In Re: S, the health authority applied for a declaration that it was lawful for the hospital to carry out an emergency caesarean section. The Official Solicitor acted as Amicus Curiae.

She may refuse to consent to the anaesthesia injection in the full knowledge that her decision may significantly reduce the chance of her unborn child being born alive. The foetus up to the moment of birth does not have any separate interests capable of being taken into account when a court has to consider an application for a declaration in respect of a caesarian section operation. The court does not have the jurisdiction to declare that such medical intervention is lawful to protect the interests of the unborn child even at the point of birth.&#8221; </span></p>

I think that would be to distort the essence of the evidence and the impression of the mother&#8217;s wishes that the medical staff were interpreting and which generated this application. It is, I think, important to acknowledge, as others have done, that judges in the past may have strained to conclude that women, in these difficult circumstances, lacked decision making capacity in order, for the highest of motives, to protect the life or health of both the mother and her unborn child. To give the mother&#8217;s articulated position this very limited interpretation would, on careful reflection, be sophistry, designed to enable me to protect the mother and her unborn child without confronting what I consider to be the true evidential picture.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">Francis JJ&#8217;s is that unlike her capacitous coeval, the mother, upon losing capacity, would lose the opportunity to express a changed decision. The birth process is, selfevidently, highly dynamic. It will frequently require obstetric re-evaluation.  With considerable diffidence, I suspect that many birth plans are changed, when confronted with the painful realities of a complicated labour. Many expectant mothers who may have vociferously disavowed epidurals re-evaluate this choice in labour. This is true of the whole gamut of obstetric options, including both induction and caesarean section. Accordingly, the strength and consistency of previously expressed views must be considered with intense subtlety and sensitivity in this highly uncertain and emotionally charged obstetric context.  Thus, it seems to me, that I must balance my instinctive inclination to protect the autonomy of a woman&#8217;s control over the invasion of her own body, with my obligation to try to ensure that her options on losing capacity are not diminished. It may be that this is not capable of resolution in principle. As always in this sphere, much will depend on the circumstances of the individual case. What, I speculate, would the medical staff be expected to do if, the Court having granted a declaration as to the unlawfulness of intervention, they found themselves confronted with a desperate but incapcitous woman screaming for unspecified medical assistance during the birth process? Certainly, there would not be time to contact a judge. Moreover, in those circumstances, I find it hard to see how the judge&#8217;s evaluation would be likely to add anything to the assessments of the nursing and medical team.

When human life is at stake the pressure to provide an affirmative answer authorising unwanted medical intervention is very powerful. Nevertheless the autonomy of each individual requires continuing protection even, perhaps particularly, when the motive for interfering with it is readily understandable, and indeed to many would appear commendable: hence the importance of remembering Lord Reid's warning against making 'even minor concessions'. If it has not already done so medical science will no doubt one day advance to the stage when a very minor procedure undergone by an adult would save the life of his or her child, or perhaps the life of a child of a complete stranger. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The caselaw has emphasised the right of a capacitous woman, in these circumstances, to behave in a way which many might regard as unreasonable or &#8220;morally repugnant&#8221;, to use Butler-Sloss LJ&#8217;s phrase. This includes the right to jeopardise the life and welfare of her foetus. When the Court has the responsibility for taking the decision, I do not consider it has the same latitude. It should not sanction that which it objectively considers to be contrary to P&#8217;s best interests. The statute prohibits this by its specific insistence on &#8216;reasonable belief&#8217; as to where P&#8217;s best interests truly lie. It is important that respect for P&#8217;s autonomy remains in focus but it will rarely be the case, in my judgement, that P&#8217;s best interests will be promoted by permitting the death of, or brain injury to, an otherwise viable and healthy foetus. In this case it may be that R&#8217;s instincts and intuitive understanding of her own body (which it must be emphasised were entirely correct) led to her strenuous insistence on a natural birth. Notwithstanding the paucity of information available, I note that there is nothing at all to suggest that R was motivated by anything other than an honest belief that this was best for both her and her baby. It is to be distinguished, for example, from those circumstances where intervention is resisted on religious or ethical grounds. In the circumstances therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that R would wish for a safe birth and a healthy baby. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It is important, in testing the reasoning above, to consider whether R, by parity of analysis, should be regarded as being in essentially the same position as an individual who had prepared an Advance Decision in the correct manner. Had R done so, could this application have been sustained? I say, at once, that I consider that an Advance Decision, properly constructed, with the appropriate safeguards in place would, in my judgement, be binding on the Court. I do not however, consider that R is in an analogous position. In preparing and drafting a carefully worded Advanced Decision, which is compliant with the statutory safeguards, P will, of necessity, have been required to identify the clear circumstances in which the refusal to comply is made. Neither, in my view, is the requirement for a signature in the presence of a witness to be regarded as a mere legal formality. It is part of a process in which a competent and capacitous adult can safely be regarded as having made prospective instructions on issues of the utmost gravity. Self-evidently, a statement, as made here, that a caesarean section is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the last thing I would want&#8217;</span> would not be compliant with the provisions. This is not because it is expressed in lay terms, it is because it is not sufficiently choate. A woman might choose, for example, not to have a caesarean even though her own life is at risk but elect to do so if the life or health of her baby is compromised. Also, and unequivocally, the capacitous adult who has prepared a statutory compliant Advanced Decision, has consciously waived the right to change her mind upon loss of capacity. R cannot be regarded, on the available evidence, as being in that position.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I do not think that I have previously delivered a judgment relating to serious medical intervention, in which I have decided the issue contrary to the identifiable wishes and feelings of P. These views are often articulated with clarity, colour and, with remarkable frequency, humour by P&#8217;s family and close friends, at a time when P has lost the capacity for reasoned expression. The Court of Protection has, for example, recognised P&#8217;s right to refuse lifesaving dialysis. It has declined applications to authorise amputations which would have, at least, significantly extended life. In extreme cases the Court has respected the refusal of nutrition by those with chronic eating disorders. The case law emphasises the importance of individual autonomy.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Caesarean sections however, present particular challenges even weighed against all these parlous circumstances. The inviolability of a woman&#8217;s body is a facet of her fundamental freedom but so too is her right to take decisions relating to her unborn child based on access, at all stages, to the complete range of options available to her. Loss of capacity in the process of labour may crucially inhibit a woman&#8217;s entitlement to make choices. At this stage the Court is required to step in to protect her, recognising that this will always require a complex, delicate and sensitive evaluation of a range of her competing rights and interests. The outcome will always depend on the particular circumstances of the individual case. </p>
