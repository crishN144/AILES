The second respondent is a solicitor who, at the time, was employed by KSN solicitors.  The EPA was suspended by DJ Batten on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2018.  The LPA could not be registered because of the dispute which led to the commencement of these proceedings. I appointed an interim deputy on 12 December 2018.

At that hearing, notwithstanding her current position to the contrary, the second respondent stated that she wished to be joined as a party to the litigation for the purposes of ensuring, as she put it, that the applicant&#8217;s wishes were carried out in relation to the LPA.  This court did not join her as a party against her wishes or stated position as she was not, on any footing, a necessary party: the applicant&#8217;s litigation friend was representing the applicant&#8217;s interests.  The order made at that hearing required her to file and serve a witness statement addressing any queries raised by the interim deputy in relation to the applicant&#8217;s affairs and her position in relation to the LPA.  At the hearing on 8 August 2019, the second respondent stated that she was disclaiming her role as attorney but wished to remain a party solely in relation to the issue of her costs.   </p>

While the interim deputy agreed that the second respondent&#8217;s costs should be paid by the applicant also, in accordance with the usual rule, the first respondent disagreed.  Sadly, the applicant died on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2020.

Sadly, that optimism was misplaced and the dispute became, if anything, more complicated.  On 24 April I permitted KSN solicitors to attend and argue the question of the second respondent&#8217;s costs because of a conflict between their positions.  The second respondent seeks only to recover her costs between 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019, when she </p>

The issue of the second respondent&#8217;s costs arises not just because of the difference in positions between the second respondent and KSN but also because, from 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019, the second respondent was acting as a litigant in person, on her own evidence.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">Curry, the second respondent cannot recover solicitors&#8217; costs because firstly, she is under no obligation or liability to pay KSN anything and secondly, she was not, at the relevant times, a partner in KSN but only an employee.  The <span style="font-style:italic">Chorley </span>principle does not apply in her case.  He relies on CPR 46.5, notwithstanding its disapplication by CoPR 19.6(7), to demonstrate that, even under the CPR, SAP would not be able to recover.  CPR 46(5) provides that a litigant in person includes a solicitor or a solicitor&#8217;s employee except where such person is represented by a firm in which that person is a partner.  It is common ground that SAP was never a partner in KSN.  In those circumstances, says Mr Curry, she is limited to the costs of a litigant in person.  He says that the purpose of the CoP rules and the disapplication of CPR 46(5) was to reduce the costs recoverable by a litigant in person therefore it would be odd if the Court of Protection were to import the <span style="font-style:italic">Chorley</span> principle (see below) and thereby increase the costs recoverable by a litigant in person.  These are, in general civil litigation, limited by CPR Part 46(1)-(4) and Practice Direction 46. He does not challenge her recovery of any costs that any litigant in person could recover, as I understand it - indeed, such a challenge would be doomed to fail. </p>

Prior to that date the second respondent was acting on behalf of the applicant pursuant to the latter&#8217;s original retainer of KSN.  In those circumstances, the second respondent was not acting independently in any way, she was acting, as Mr Reed says, as KSN&#8217;s agent, or employee, in carrying out the applicant&#8217;s instructions, pursuant to the retainer to act for her in these proceedings.  Neither KSN nor the second respondent were parties but simply the persons through whom the applicant acted.  The second respondent would have no standing to pursue the applicant for costs at that time as it was KSN who had the benefit of the retainer.  The second respondent was not, at that time, instructing KSN, it was the applicant who did so. Both respondents agree that that was the position and I agree with them.  </p>

If they have and there is a dispute about it they can refer it to the Senior Courts Costs Office (&#8220;SCCO&#8221;).  I have no jurisdiction, in these proceedings, to address any dispute between them particularly in circumstances where the executors have not been informed of the dispute or been given an opportunity to be heard.

As the costs are payable out of the applicant&#8217;s residual estate, it makes no difference to the first respondent whether the estate or the first respondent pays as the latter is the beneficiary of her mother&#8217;s residuary estate.  For the avoidance of doubt, I am not suggesting that the first respondent should, or otherwise would, have been ordered to pay costs personally.  They will all come out of the estate. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Mr Reed accepted that no costs were recoverable in relation to KSN&#8217;s fees post 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2020 as they were neither a party nor, in any sense, acting for SAP.  For the avoidance of doubt, I can see no basis for awarding KSN any of the costs incurred on its own account.  It was not a party and, as matters have turned out, its involvement has not assisted in resolving the issues.  I can see no reason why the estate should bear the additional burden.  </p>
