	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">This application concerns a young man who is 16 &#189; years of age. I shall refer to him as J. J is said by the local authority to be beyond parental control to the degree required to satisfy the threshold criteria pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The mother is desperately worried for the safety of her son when he goes missing and does not return for days at a time. J has in recent months lived with his maternal grandmother but he goes missing from her care, with neither the mother nor the grandmother knowing where he is and he ignores their attempts to contact him when he is absent. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Although J&#8217;s home is in London, it is clear from information provided to the local authority by the police that he travels extensively around the country. In July 2019 he was arrested in Basingstoke for drug possession. In April 2019 he was arrested and found to have 70 wraps of crack cocaine concealed in his underwear. In February 2020 he was arrested in Somerset believed to be involved in &#8216;county lines&#8217; drug distribution. In May 2020 he was arrested in Kent at a property connected with the cultivation of cannabis. In July 2020 it is believed he was in Peterborough and at a risk of violence as he escaped arrest and was thought to have &#8216;snitched&#8217; on others. He has most recently been arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine and when in possession of a knife. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The concerns for J&#8217;s welfare extend well beyond his involvement with drugs. In 2018, J&#8217;s closest friend died as a result of a gang related stabbing. J had gone missing on many occasions prior to this tragic event as he had already been drawn into gang culture. In March 2020, J himself was the victim of an assault by 3 adult males and, in June 2020, J was with male friend when that friend was attacked with an axe, the friend losing 2 fingers as a result of the assault. J has reported that 2 more of his friends have died due to gang related violence.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">It is not necessary for the purposes of this urgent application to record the full detail of all the risks to which J has exposed himself when beyond the control of his mother. The brief summary above is sufficient to demonstrate that J&#8217;s involvement with criminal activity and with gang violence exposes him to a very high risk of significant harm, including a risk of death.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Attempts have been made to separate J from gang culture in London. Early Help support was provided in 2018 and the mother was encouraged to move areas; a move the mother was not prepared to make for business and other reasons. J was moved to live with a relative in Yorkshire but her soon returned to London. He was enrolled in a group programme but only attended 2 sessions. Both a &#8216;Rescue and Response&#8217; worker and a &#8216;Child Criminal Exploitation&#8217; worker have been allocated to work with J but no change in behaviour has been achieved. J is believed by the local authority to be an exploited child given his involvement in county lines drug distribution but all strategies tried so far have failed to effect a change. All efforts the mother, the grandmother and local authority staff have made have failed to protect J from harm or to persuade J to protect himself. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">A residential placement was offered to J in late 2019 but the offer was not taken up by the mother as she did not want J to believe that the family had given up on him. However, J&#8217;s move to live with the grandmother has not been successful as he has frequently absented himself throughout this year and continued to put himself at risk. The mother now accepts that a more significant intervention needs to be made to protect J from harm. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">On 18 August 2020 the local authority applied to the court for an interim care order. The social work statement in support of the application states that what is required is &#8220;a residential placement with deprivation of liberty attached will ensure J is safeguarded and also afford him the stability he requires while work is completed with him to support him&#8221;. That application was heard by a Circuit Judge on 21 August 2020. The children&#8217;s guardian did not feel that she could support the local authority&#8217;s plan without an identified placement. The guardian was not opposing the application for an interim care order. </p>

However, in my judgment it is essential that a local authority making an application to the court complies with the requirements of the President&#8217;s guidance. The secure accommodation procedures provide important protections for children confined in such institutions. In my judgment, a placement that does not provide those same protections should only be authorised when absolutely necessary. Sadly, at the current time when there is a significant gap between registered secure accommodation provision and registered secure accommodation need, unregistered placements are often absolutely necessary. </p>

I am satisfied on the evidence contained in the 2 social work statements, that are not challenged by the mother, that the risks to J&#8217;s physical and emotional health are very serious and include a significant risk of serious injury and a very real risk of death. There are no registered secure units available so the protection the local authority seeks to provide to J cannot be provided by the making of any other order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">I accept the evidence of the social worker and agree that what is required is for J to be separated from the gang culture in which he is immersed and for intensive work to be undertaken with him to address his harmful behaviours, with the aim of helping him make the choices necessary to protect himself from harm. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">I am entirely satisfied that the threshold criteria is satisfied as required for the making of an interim order and, taking J&#8217;s welfare as my paramount consideration and having regard to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, I make an interim care order to the local authority until the conclusion of these proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Although J has not had the opportunity to put his own views before the court, I find the local authority&#8217;s plan is in J&#8217;s best interests. I have considered whether a less restrictive placement should be preferred but I am satisfied, given J&#8217;s history of absenting himself from the home of his mother and grandmother, that J will seek to abscond from any placement provided by the local authority unless his ability to absent himself is restricted. J needs protection and the opportunity to build relationships away from the gang culture that has been the dominant influence on him for a number of years. I am satisfied that any placement that does not have the authorisation to deprive J of his liberty as proposed by the local authority is very likely to fail with the result that J will again expose himself to a serious risk of significant harm. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the care plan proposed by the local authority is both necessary and proportionate as, in my judgment and for the reasons I have given, no other arrangement is likely to be successful in protecting J from the harm to which he has been exposing himself or from the exploitation he has suffered. Therefore, I authorise the local authority to deprive J of his liberty as may be required both when informing J of my decision, transporting him to the unit and when within the unit. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">However, the local authority sought an initial authorisation for a period of 6 weeks. The guardian&#8217;s view was that 6 weeks was unlikely to be enough to enable J to settle and begin to build relationships at the unit. Given J&#8217;s age, in my judgment it would be wrong for me to grant authorisation to deprive J of his liberty for an extended period without giving J himself the opportunity to be heard. It is likely that he will not welcome being confined in a unit many miles from the area familiar to him and he must be given the opportunity to communicate to the court his own views for managing and resolving the safeguarding issues I have set out in this judgment. Therefore, I will grant an authorisation for a period of 8 days and list this case back before me for consideration of the local authority&#8217;s application for a longer period of authorisation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Given J&#8217;s age it is likely that he will read this judgment for himself. He is likely to think that it is full of jargon and expressions of the law that do not seem relevant to him as he sees the world today. The message that I want to convey to J is simple. He has spent the past year or more engaging in activities that could have led to him being seriously hurt or even killed. His mother wants him to be protected and the local authority has a duty to protect him. I have decided that he needs time away from all those people who encourage him to stay away from home and when not at home, want him to behave in ways that he knows might cause him to be arrested by the police or seriously hurt by other people. I am giving the local authority permission to prevent him from leaving the unit where he will now be living and for them to restrict his access with anyone outside of the unit and prevent him using his mobile telephone and social media. I have decided that these are necessary steps to prevent him from putting himself in danger but I will hear what J himself wants to happen when the case comes before me again next week. </p>
