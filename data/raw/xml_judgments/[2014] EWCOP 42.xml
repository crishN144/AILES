Requests by myself to be included in matters directly related to my mother have been ignored by both applicants and they continue to refuse to communicate with me. Recently, among other things, they have denied me access to and have undertaken the clearance of the contents and personal effects from my mother&#8217;s previous home whilst refusing to advise me of how and where these items (some of sentimental value) have been disposed of. I do not believe that my mother would have either wished for or approved of these actions.</p>
