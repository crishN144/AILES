	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">A and B are the children&#8217;s parents. They have not cared for the children for some years due to the destructive consequences of their chronic drug addiction and resulting neglect of the children. Both parents were very irregular attenders at contact with the children and attending other appointments for assessments. The only member of the wider family who was assessed was a paternal aunt. The full assessment did not support placement of the children with her. Care and placement orders were made on 4 November 2016, with the court endorsing the plan for adoption. The parents last saw the children in March 2017, following which the children were placed with the prospective adopters in early April 2017, where they remain.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The parents seek leave to oppose the adoption application and found their application on the prospects of placement of the children with the maternal aunt, C who is the subject of a positive SGO assessment. The parents and C state she was not properly assessed earlier by the local authority when she should have been. That failure is broadly accepted by the local authority. One of the tragedies in this case is that all parties agree had C been assessed prior to the children being placed with prospective adopters there is every likelihood the children would have been placed with her. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The applications by the parents and C are opposed by the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian, who submit, in summary, that it would be deeply damaging to move the children now due to the secure attachments they have now formed with the prospective adopters and the instability and harm that would be caused if that was disrupted. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The court is in the somewhat unusual position of considering both an application for leave to oppose and leave to apply for an SGO in circumstances where the final assessments have been done. These assessments (risk assessment by Janet Walker ISW, attachment assessment by Dr D and SGO assessment on C by Terence Wilson ISW) were directed for understandable reasons, to avoid delay and because of the unusual circumstances of this case. In February 2018 C indicated she would be withdrawing her application, due to her concerns about disrupting the children&#8217;s placement as she accepted they were happy there. As a consequence, the hearing time in April 2018 was reduced to reflect that. Unfortunately, on the eve of the April hearing the local authority circulated an electronic court bundle that had identifying details about the adoptive placement. To her very great credit, C immediately notified the parties and the court once she realised the position. However, this serious data breach by the local authority meant the prospective adopters and the children had to </p>

She was concerned they would feel no one in the birth family wanted them. She seeks an order that would start the process of the children being placed with her. The matter was re-allocated to me in April 2018 and following two directions hearings was listed for 4 days, commencing 14 August. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">No-one could have sat through this hearing without being struck by the wholly genuine position of both the prospective adopters and C. What shines out from all the written and oral evidence is that these three adults all want to do what is best for these two children. That is their common aim. The prospective adopters have shown admirable commitment in caring for the children. They have sought and taken on board any advice, have provided the security and stability that the children needed which was lacking when they were in the care of their parents. C fully recognises all they have done for the children and that the children are, as she describes, in a happy place. C was unaware until relatively recently what the position was in relation to the children. She lives some distance away, had her own children to care for and was wholly inexperienced in these types of proceedings and lacked any experience of dealing with the local authority in these circumstances. I accept her evidence that she had no real understanding how serious the position was until late summer 2017. By the time she was assessed, and the final documents were completed in these proceedings, it was accepted by all that if she had been assessed at a much earlier stage there is every likelihood the children would have been placed with her. The conflict this puts C in was evident for all to see when she gave her oral evidence which was both powerful and moving; she recognises the children are happy where they are but does not want the children to feel later in life no-one in the family wanted to care for them. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Put simply, the question I have to decide at this hearing is whether in August 2018 the children should remain with the prospective adopters or be placed with C. Whatever decision I do reach I am satisfied that going forward there should be proper structures in place to support the children&#8217;s placement wherever it is and tangible and effective support put in place that can be provided to whoever the children are not placed with. The local authority, who in my judgment bear the responsibility for the position the prospective adopters are in (through the data breach) and C (through failing to assess her when they should have done) must ensure this is in place and pro-actively ensure it is maintained for as long as it is required. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">As set out below I am critical of the conduct of this local authority. I, of course, accept that they operate under considerable pressure however I am satisfied in this case basic core social work was not carried out by the allocated social worker during the care proceedings and prior to placement of the children with the prospective adopters. There was a failure to make basic enquiries about the possibility of placement in the wider family, this error was compounded by a failure of effective supervision of the allocated social worker and scrutiny by the IRO who was allocated to the case, who both share the responsibility for these failures. This was compounded further by the Agency Decision Maker, who approved the plans for an adoptive placement without properly scrutinising whether the wider family had been properly looked at. Additionally, from late summer 2017 when the prospects of placement with C became a possibility the local authority were obstructive and negative about assessing C and did not retain an open mind, as they should have done. This is perhaps best illustrated by two social workers spending over 7 hours with C, with no proper planning or record being kept and then writing to C stating they were not changing their plan. It is of note and striking that only a few months later an ISW assessment undertaken by Terence Wilson, on the same material, came to an entirely positive assessment of C. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">What this case has highlighted is the critical importance of a local authority having effective systems in place from an early stage in care proceedings to ensure that the wider maternal/paternal families are considered as possible placement options for the children. Whilst it is recognised that the parents should put forward any names they want to be considered, that does not absolve the local authority of the enquiries they should independently be making. The continued retort by the local authority that the parents had failed to put anyone forward failed to recognise these are parents who failed to provide the basic care for their children or provide basic co-operation within the care proceedings, this local authority should have undertaken their own enquiries. What is of such concern in this case is that an older half-sister of the children was already placed with a maternal aunt. There is simply no evidence of this local authority even considering this obvious placement possibility or that aunt being a source of wider family information. </p>

C gave compelling evidence about how she simply had no idea of the difficulties, she had been led to believe the difficulties were short term and the children would be returned to their parents. She thought the mother was clean from drugs (when she clearly wasn&#8217;t) and, if required, C thought she would be contacted by the local authority. </p>

The consequences for the prospective adopters and the children to move at short notice and to take the significant steps they have taken to protect their and the children&#8217;s identity have been considerable. I directed statements as to what steps have been taken to ensure this does not happened again. Whilst I accept that this was genuine human error, as set out in the statements by two senior members of the Legal Department the changes in procedures outlined in those statements go some way to ensure it doesn&#8217;t happen again. </p>

It is, in my view, not possible in this context to distinguish between an application for leave to apply to revoke a placement order and an application for leave to apply for a residence order in ongoing adoption proceedings.   Both are for the "initiation of proceedings" and consequently an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/29/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 29(4)</ref>(b) falls outside <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(7)</ref> in the same way as this court held in </span>Warwickshire CC v M<span style="font-style:italic"> was the case with respect to an application under s24.

She submits that whether or not there has been a change in circumstances may be relevant in some cases, however, where, as here, the provision applies to "any other person" that class of individuals could include, for example, a natural father of a child who lacks parental responsibility.   He, it is suggested, may emerge into the subsequent adoption proceedings late in the day, and have played no part in the "circumstances" which justified the making of the original placement order.   Miss Henke therefore argues that there should be a one stage test within which the court will, naturally, look at the previous factual matrix and compare the current circumstances but without the formal structural need for a discrete first stage at which "a change in circumstances" has to be established.  </span></p>

In any application of this nature, where the applicant is not simply wishing to have a voice in the proceedings but is seeking leave to apply for a residence order, the underlying factual circumstances, and any change in those circumstances since the making of the original placement order, is likely to be of great relevance.  Parliament has, however, held back from introducing an express statutory provision requiring the court to be satisfied about a change in circumstances where the application is for leave under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/29/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 29(4)</ref>, in contrast to the approach taken in the other two provisions.   I would therefore step back from holding that there is such a specific requirement where leave is sought under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/29/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 29(4)</ref>.

Typically, however, an application for leave under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/47/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 47(5)</ref> can fairly and should appropriately be dealt with on the basis of written evidence and submissions: see Re P paras [53]&#8211;[54]. </span></p>

Given modern expectation of life, this means that, with a young child, one is looking far ahead into a very distant future &#8211; upwards of eighty or even ninety years. Against this perspective, judges must be careful not to attach undue weight to the short-term consequences for the child if leave to oppose is given. In this as in other contexts, judges should be guided by what Sir Thomas Bingham MR said in Re O (Contact: Imposition of Conditions) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 124" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 124</ref>, 129, that: &#8216;the court should take a medium-term and long-term view of the child's development and not accord excessive weight to what appear likely to be short-term or transient problems.' That was said in the context of contact but it has a much wider resonance: Re G (Education: Religious Upbringing) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/1233" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 1233" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 1233</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 1 FLR 677" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 1 FLR 677</ref>, para [26]. </span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:-0.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">(ix)Almost invariably the judge will be pressed with the argument that leave to oppose should be refused, amongst other reasons, because of the adverse impact on the prospective adopters, and thus on the child, of their having to pursue a contested adoption application. We do not seek to trivialise an argument which may in some cases have considerable force, particularly perhaps in a case where the child is old enough to have some awareness of what is going on. But judges must be careful not to attach undue weight to the argument. After all, what from the perspective of the proposed adopters was the smoothness of the process which they no doubt anticipated when issuing their application with the assurance of a placement order, will already have been disturbed by the unwelcome making of the application for leave to oppose. And the disruptive effects of an order giving a parent leave to oppose can be minimised by firm judicial case management before the hearing of the application for leave. If appropriate directions are given, in particular in relation to the expert and other evidence to be adduced on behalf of the parent, as soon as the application for leave is issued and before the question of leave has been determined, it ought to be possible to direct either that the application for leave is to be listed with the substantive adoption application to follow immediately, whether or not leave is given, or, if that is not feasible, to direct that the substantive application is to be listed, whether or not leave has been given, very shortly after the leave hearing. </span></p>

The key issue here (Re B-S, para 59) is whether the parent&#8217;s prospects of success are more than just fanciful, whether they have solidity. If the answer to that question is no, that will be the end of the matter. &#8230; In evaluating the parent&#8217;s ultimate prospects of success if given leave to oppose, the judge has to remember that the child&#8217;s welfare is paramount and must consider the child&#8217;s welfare throughout his life. In evaluating what the child&#8217;s welfare demands the judge will bear in mind what has happened in the past, the current state of affairs and what will or may happen in future. There will be cases, perhaps many cases, where, despite the change in circumstances, the demands of the child&#8217;s welfare are such as to lead the judge to the conclusion that the parent&#8217;s prospects of success lack solidity.

This sets the tone of the statement which in my judgment is designed to be entirely defensive of the local authority position, lacks the balance it should have and fails to acknowledge any failings by this local authority to undertake the enquiries it should have done prior to October.  </p>

It is noteworthy that the IRO records the decision of the first LAC review for the social worker to explore extended family but gives no indication as to how that action was followed in the second LAC review. The inference is that the apparent failure to undertake those enquiries was not put under any scrutiny at the second LAC meeting. This is perhaps illustrated by the failure of the local authority to file a complete genogram in the care proceedings, the one in the papers was done after the commencement of the adoption proceedings. </p>

The following example gives the flavour at para 23 <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;There is nothing in the case note [of 22 June 2016] to suggest that either of the parents proposed C as an alternative carer&#8230;in this conversation with the allocated social worker&#8217;.</span> With the clear implication that the allocated social worker is merely the recipient of information with no independent obligation on him to undertake basic proactive enquiries to establish who the wider family were and whether they could care for these children. This is despite the positive decision of the LAC review meeting on22 June 2016 requiring him to do so, which was simply not followed up in the meeting on 7 September. The statement at paragraph 36 seeks to put responsibility on C to have contacted the local authority to put herself forward. F in her oral evidence confirmed this statement was approved by a senior manager in the permanency team. It is unfortunate, to say the least, that the message conveyed by this statement was not modified as, in my view it should have been, to reflect the responsibility on this local authority for the position the children were in and the failure by them to properly investigate the placement options for these children with the wider family. </p>

First the secure attachment the children have with the prospective adopters and what that means for these children means any permanent separation from them is likely to impact on the children both developmentally and emotionally. The children have already experienced considerable loss and separation, the risks if they move from the prospective adopters is that they may revert to their earlier behavioural presentations or shut down emotionally. The trust and security in the relationship they have built up with the prospective adopters has taken time and provides building blocks for future relationships. To separate them now from the prospective adopters and introduce another style of parenting and relationship risks the security and stability they have to date, is likely to confuse and when considered with the impact on their ability to trust this could adversely impact on their capacity to form future close and meaningful relationships. Dr D describes their identity as being &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">firmly established&#8217;</span> within the prospective adoptive family, they readily identify with the cousins, aunts, uncles and friends.  </p>

She displayed enormous empathy and understanding about the position of the children and the prospective adopters and recognised the children were happy and loved by them. Her fears are based on the risk of disruption of the placement by the parents and the impact of that on the children, together with the risks to them of finding out that their sibling and half siblings are placed within the wider family and would ask themselves why they were not as well. She was very concerned that the children should not feel at any stage they were not wanted by the birth family. No one who heard that evidence could have been left in any doubt that the children&#8217;s welfare and what is right for them was the focus of her evidence and, in my judgment, will remain the focus in the future. She deserves the admiration of the court for the care and consideration she has shown to not only the children but the prospective adopters as well, paying a heartfelt tribute to them and what they have done for the children. </p>

From their perspective they set out how they felt unsupported by <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;senior figures in the local authority&#8217;</span> following the parents indicating they were going to oppose the adoption and, in particular, following the data breach. Regarding the respective welfare checklists (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1 (3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1(4)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>) she submits the starting point is the harm the children have suffered, their emotional needs arising from their harmful experience and the ability of each of the respective carers to meet those needs and provide a secure home environment and the impact on the children of any change and the effect on them throughout their lives of having ceased to be a member of their birth family and become an adopted person. She relies on the evidence of Dr D, Ms Walker and Mr Travers and the impact on these children at this time of such a move of carer. She recognises the advantages for the children of being placed with the birth family but, she submits that has to be balanced with the evidence of the extent of harm to the children if they move from their current placement. Even recognising the strengths of C&#8217;s parenting history and skills such a move would still be contrary to the welfare of the children, even considering the lifelong welfare analysis required in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(4)</ref>. Reliance is placed on Dr D&#8217;s oral evidence, that expands on what she sets out in her report. She submits the risks consequent on the data breach in relation to the prospective adopters has to be factored in, but the court can rely on the steps that have been taken to date and are planned to take that reduce those risks. That risk has to be considered in the context of what is known about the parents and the effective strategies that have been deployed to date. Regarding future contact she submits what is now required is a period of reflection and the changes that are on the immediate horizon. With a more structured adoption support plan in place there is then a process to enable the indirect contact to take place with the prospect of other arrangements being considered in the future. The prospective adopters have shown they are committed to life story work, that is going to overseen by F and Dr D and the prospective adopters though their own backgrounds bring added insight into importance of this work. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Ms Kelly on behalf of C in her thoughtful and measured submissions provides a helpful analysis of the relevant issues and evidence. She submits insufficient weight has been given to the benefits of growing up inside the birth family, not only as a general proposition but the features of this case where there is a well-trodden path of the wider family looking after siblings and half-siblings. It did not feature in the balancing exercise undertaken by the local authority and remains a risk for the children in the future. The risk of the parents seeking to locate the placement has not properly been factored in bearing in mind the extent of the information the parents were sent and the risks for these children of another disruption, possibly at short notice. The level of insight C has shown to the position of the children has not sufficiently been taken account of when considering the steps that could be taken with support of ameliorating the risks of the children moving to C. She submits the court needs to be cautious about the weight the court attaches to the conclusions of Ms Walker and Mr Travers, the former was limited to a large extent to considering the risks from the disclosure breach and the latter took an early view supporting the adoption without conducting his own evaluation of C. She confirms C does not seek a contact order, and emphasises that C is in a very different position from the parents, there is no evidence to support she might inadvertently disclose details and she offers a safe bridge between the adoptive family and birth family that is very likely to assist them in their identity and coming to terms with their own history. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Ms Kelly makes the valid point that in undertaking the holistic welfare evaluation in the second part (with the child&#8217;s lifelong welfare under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> being the paramount consideration) where the parent&#8217;s application is founded entirely on C&#8217;s application this should be the focus of the exercise with no need to separately consider any deemed application by C to apply for an SGO. I accept her submissions that leave should be granted. There are solid grounds based on the positive assessment of C, which all parties accept if it had been available earlier the children would have been placed with her. This option presents a realistic option of the children being placed in the birth family, which bearing in mind the consequences of adoption and the requirement of the court to consider the ability and willingness of any of the relatives to meet their needs supports leave being given. The court has to weigh in the balance any harm in granting leave, in this case there is none as there will be no delay in determining the competing applications. Mr Metaxa submits there are advantages to these children in the unique circumstances of this case for the court to go on and consider the competing applications. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">For these reasons I will give leave for the parents to oppose the making of the adoption order. The practical effect of that is that C should be given leave to make her application for a SGO, the prospects of success of that application have solidity and the welfare interests of the children would be met by the court considering the application particularly as no delay will be incurred. </p>

The reality in this case is there are two competing placement options for the children; remaining with the prospective adopters under an adoption order or placement with C under an SGO. </p>

All the reports evidence their enormous commitment to these children, their willingness to take and act on support and advice, both before and after the data breach. C in her oral evidence acknowledged this, she paid tribute to the love and commitment the prospective adopters have shown to the children. </p>

The evidence comes primarily from Dr D, F and Mr Travers. All of whom have visited over a period of time and give detailed evidence to support the changes they have observed. However, if the children remain with the prospective adopters and an adoption order is made they will lose the opportunity and advantages of being brought up within the birth family and being able to maintain real links with siblings and half siblings, although the evidence demonstrates they have limited knowledge of the birth family and no established relationship or knowledge of C. </p>

C has displayed great empathy in relation to the children&#8217;s position and recognises the need she will have for support and expresses a willingness to fully utilise such support she will be given and, as Mr Wilson observed, will not shy from voicing her concerns if she considers additional support is required. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">There are real risks to the children&#8217;s emotional and developmental health if they move from their current placement, I accept the evidence of Dr D. Even taking into account all the parenting skills and experience C undoubtedly has and her willingness to take advice and support the evidence establishes that the sense of trust the children have been able to build up would be damaged by any move, and be detrimental on the children both emotionally and developmentally, with long term implications on their ability to make and maintain secure relationships. The secure attachments the children now have are their reality and is the best base from which to confront the various issues that lay ahead of them in understanding their past. The prospective adopters have already demonstrated their ability to do this. Whilst recognising the importance of placement in the birth family and the advantages such a placement would have, particularly one as experienced and loving as C would be, the risks of emotional and developmental harm to these children in the particular circumstances they are in now is in my judgment too high. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Having undertaken the comparative analysis of the competing options I have carefully considered the proportionality of each option and whether anything less than adoption will do. I am satisfied that only an adoption order will meet the welfare needs of these two children, which is the order I am going to make. The impact of change of placement would likely cause them harm through disruption of their current attachments and that such harm cannot be ameliorated by the accepted qualities of C&#8217;s parenting, even as a member of the birth family. This decision is governed by these children&#8217;s particular needs now and is no criticism of C&#8217;s position in this case. I agree with the prospective adopters she has had the children&#8217;s welfare at the forefront of her mind. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I leave this troubling case with the hope that despite the difficulties in this litigation this hearing has ensured the court has undertaken a thorough investigation of the options for these children. My hope now is that now a decision has been made, with a structured support plan in place and time for reflection real and tangible steps can be taken to re-build trust between the prospective adopters and C. In my judgment that is likely to be of great assistance and benefit to both the prospective adopters and the children in the years to come.  </p>
