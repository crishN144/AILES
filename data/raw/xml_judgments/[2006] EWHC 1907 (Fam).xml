	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A is a baby boy born on 30 April 2005. He is in the care of the local authority under an interim care order and has been since he was only a few months old. His mother (M) is unable to care for him because of drug related difficulties. His father is thought to be E who is a young man living in Greece. Although he seems to have known of A&#8217;s birth from a few months after it took place, he has not had any involvement in his life and he does not have parental responsibility for A. Recently, he offered A a home with him. Representatives of the local authority travelled to Greece to assess him but their findings were not favourable and, having considered all the evidence on the issue, I ruled him out. The plan is therefore for A to go to live in Germany with his mother&#8217;s half brother and the half brother&#8217;s wife, Mr and Mrs G. This plan is put forward by the local authority and endorsed by A&#8217;s guardian. M also instructed her counsel to consent to it although making it clear that she did not consent to the placement being with a view to adoption.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Last week, I was asked to make such orders as are necessary to allow A to go to live in Germany. I dealt then with the factual matters that needed to be resolved in this respect, leaving only the issue of whether there was any legal method by which I could properly authorise the local authority to arrange for A to leave this country to live with Mr and Mrs G. Although on the face of it of very narrow ambit, this proved to be a question of exceptional complexity because the case falls to be dealt with in the light of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> as well as the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption Act 1976</ref> and it brings into play, in particular, the transitional arrangements under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>. I am somewhat reassured that the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">In re A (Adoption: Placement Outside Jurisdiction) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2004/515" uk:canonical="[2004] EWCA Civ 515" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWCA Civ 515</ref> remarked upon the difficulty of this area of law, even without the complication of the transitional provisions and with, no doubt, considerably more argument than it was possible for there to be in front of me at a hearing that was listed as a one hour directions hearing. This is certainly not intended as a criticism of counsel who did their utmost to assist me and did so ably. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I set out my factual findings in an extempore judgment last week. As well as dealing with the question of whether there should be further exploration of E&#8217;s proposal to care for A, I resolved a number of matters with an eye to the possibility that closer examination of the law may reveal that it would be legitimate to authorise A to go abroad under the provisions of paragraph 19 of Schedule 2 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. I dealt with the merits of the Germany plan which I approved as being in the best interests of A. I expressed myself satisfied that suitable arrangements have been made or will be made for his reception and welfare in Germany. I recorded that A&#8217;s consent to the plan was unnecessary as he does not have sufficient understanding to give it. I also indicated that if necessary, I dispensed with M&#8217;s consent to the plan on the basis that it was unreasonably withheld. This may be thought to have been otiose given that she had actually indicated through her counsel that she consented, but it was felt prudent in the light of her absence from the hearing and her tendency to change her mind and in the light of her stipulation that she did not consent to adoption.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reserved judgment on the law and it was only whilst working on this that the full complexity of the issues became apparent. It will be appreciated that, in the light of the present state of judicial resources, no time is allocated during the normal working week for the writing of judgments such as this. That, together with the need to give my decision urgently, meant that although I have spent many hours on this matter, my endeavours might not have been sufficient. Accordingly, when the draft was sent out, I invited counsel to assist if I had made obvious errors in carrying out my own research and reaching my own conclusions. They made further helpful contributions.</p>

The local authority&#8217;s Adoption and Permanency Panel accepted in principle in November 2005 that it was in A&#8217;s best interests to be adopted. That panel has not yet approved Mr and Mrs G as adopters for him. So far, the Gs have only been approved as kinship foster carers by the local authority&#8217;s Fostering Panel; this was done on 5 June 2006. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An order under s 84 is an order giving parental responsibility to persons who intend to adopt a child under the law of a country outside the British Islands. Application cannot be made by the prospective adopters for a s 84 order unless the child has had its home with the applicant(s) at all times during the preceding ten weeks.  There is a view that this period of residence must take place in England and Wales but I am not required to consider, for the purposes of this application, whether that is correct. Regulations can be made under s 86 modifying <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 85</ref> in certain circumstances, including where the prospective adopters are relatives of the child.  It is hoped that such regulations will soon be made although counsel have informed me that they have been told that nothing is planned. If it is correct that the 10 weeks residence has to be in this country, it will necessitate very considerable disruption of the family life of the prospective adopters who may not be able to fulfil the condition or may be deterred by it from providing a home for a child which would otherwise meet that child&#8217;s needs admirably. In addition to the residence condition, any other requirements prescribed by regulations must also be satisfied before a s 84 order can be made. </p>

One such situation may be where the plan is adoption abroad but, for some reason, the child is to go to live with someone else before taking up residence with prospective adopters. I will examine in due course whether another situation may be where, as here, the child is to be placed immediately with the family who it is hoped will adopt him but the local authority has not yet taken all the formal steps necessary to approve the placement for adoption. </p>

It would, however, be premature for them to proceed with it at this stage, not least because no order can be made under s 55 until the child has been living with the applicants for 6 months. It is therefore contemplated that a final hearing may be appropriate in the New Year 2007. Meanwhile, there is an urgent need for the local authority to arrange for A to go to live with the Gs in Germany. All the necessary practical preparations have been made for this. Both the English local authority and the German social services have assessed the Gs favourably. In addition to the English local authority panel approving them as foster carers, the German central authority has given its consent for the placement as is required by Article 56 of Brussels IIA. Investigations with a German lawyer appear to state that A&#8217;s adoption in Germany would not pose a legal problem. The challenge has been to find a way in which the placement which is so obviously in A&#8217;s best interests can go ahead legitimately in advance of a s 55 order in favour of the Gs.</p>

If authority cannot be given under that paragraph, it seems to me that either the Gs would have to take up temporary residence here for at least 6 months so that A can live with them here and the residence requirement for s 55 can be satisfied or the s 55 application might have to be abandoned and a s 84 application made instead (which would still require residence, quite probably here, but for a shorter period).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first question is which form of paragraph 19 applies to the local authority&#8217;s application for approval for A to go abroad. Although it was obviously part of the plan as far back as December 2005 that such an application would be made in due course, no one argues that it was actually made until after 30 December 2005. Even had it been, there does not appear to be any provision saving paragraph 19 applications that were extant at 30 December 2005. Accordingly, the first assumption is that paragraph 19 applies to this application in its new form. That means that it contains the paragraph 19(9) prohibition on its use where the local authority is placing a child for adoption with prospective adopters. It also means that paragraph 19(6) refers to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 85</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> rather than <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/56" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 56</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1976 Act</ref>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This first assumption needs to be examined in more detail, however.

It is always difficult to be sure that one has found all the relevant provisions but my researches have not uncovered anything that expressly perpetuates <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/56" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 56</ref>, even where a s 55 application remains extant. Counsel for the local authority submitted that some continued existence for <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/56" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 56</ref> after 30 December 2005 must have been contemplated by the legislature because paragraph 11 of Schedule 4 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> amends it. Why bother if it was being simultaneously repealed, the argument goes? It seems to me, however that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/56" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 56</ref> was not, in fact, ever intended to be amended and repealed in one fell swoop, nor was it. The paragraph 11 amendment of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/56" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 56</ref> came into force in June 2003, a full 18 months before the bulk of the new adoption regime and before the repeal of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption Act 1976</ref>. This makes it probable that the paragraph 11 amendment was intended as an urgent measure to restrict the circumstances in which a child could be sent abroad which would cover the period until the new adoption law came into effect.    </p>

The adoption agency would then determine the way forward in the light of the panel&#8217;s recommendations.

Having found that the conditions for such approval are satisfied, as I set out in my extempore judgment, I accordingly grant such approval. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel for the guardian assisted me with an alternative view of the position with regard to paragraph 19 which, if right, obviates the need even to consider the new paragraph 19(9). The result, if I were to approach matters in this way, would be the same in that I would be able to give, and would give, paragraph 19 approval. Nevertheless, I propose to set out her suggested analysis so that it will be available should there be further debate on the point in this case or any other. It is as follows:</p>

It would be illogical for paragraph 19 to survive partly in its old form but with the new paragraph 19(9) incorporated. The intention must have been to retain the entirety of the old paragraph 19 for the transitional period. Paragraph 19 should therefore be read without the new paragraph 19(9) so that there would be no prohibition on approval being given even where the local authority is placing the child for adoption with prospective adopters.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My anxiety about counsel for the guardian&#8217;s analysis is that it is not one that is spelled out in the transitional provisions although it could have been, and it depends to an extent upon an assumption that the only utility for <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 55</ref> is to make it lawful to send a child abroad for adoption, circumventing <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/56" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 56</ref>. The instant case is, however, an example of a case where the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 55</ref> order is not going to be needed for that purpose but still has a utility because it will, in due course, be the means to give the Gs parental responsibility for A in the period prior to the German adoption.</p>
