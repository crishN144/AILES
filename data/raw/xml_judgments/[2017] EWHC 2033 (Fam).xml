	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application by a father for permission to appeal against various orders made by HH Judge Tolson QC in the Family Court, initially in Oxford, latterly in Central London, in proceedings concerning the father&#8217;s daughter, E, now aged 6. The respondent to the proceedings is the child&#8217;s mother.</p>

According to the father, by this point the parents&#8217; relationship was in difficulties and in 2013 they separated. Initially, care of E was substantially shared, with E spending 5 days in every fortnight with the father. Subsequently that was reduced and reduced again when the mother and E moved to London and the father and his new partner moved to Gloucestershire. </p>

In July 2014, it was alleged that the father failed to make plain his agreement to the mother taking E abroad on holiday. The mother applied to the court and permission was granted. In September 2014, the mother applied to court again when the father failed to return E after a contact visit. The court ordered the father to return the child.   On 3 October 2014, a substantive hearing took place at which District Judge Jenkins made a child arrangements order that E should live with her mother and should have defined contact with the father which, at that stage, was on the basis that E should spend two weekends out of three with her father together with one half of the school holidays under a detailed defined order for holiday contact. In December 2015, the father again failed to return E after a contact visit, and the mother applied ex parte and was granted an order for her immediate return. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In February 2015, the matter returned to court on the father&#8217;s application to change the child arrangements so as to provide that E would live with him. The limited grounds on which he sought to justify this change included an allegation that E had been scratched by the family cat, which he claimed had threatened her sight. The judge observed that three-year-olds interfere with the family cat to their own detriment on occasions and this could not possibly be a basis upon which the arrangements for E&#8217;s care could be changed. He concluded in his judgment:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;This application is unreal. It is all part of what appears to be [the father&#8217;s] continuation of a battle which should have been resolved in October 2014. It is to be seen as part of his failure to return E just before Christmas to the mother&#8217;s care, an action in respect of which I had to make urgent orders on the previous occasion when I dealt with this case. As I seem to recall saying on that occasion, [the father] simply has to appreciate that a court order is a court order. It is there to be obeyed and it is not be changed unless circumstances have changed radically.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>The judge was invited to make orders in respect of the costs not only of that hearing but of earlier hearings when costs had been reserved. He decided to reserve again the costs of the hearing in July 2014, but ordered the father to pay the costs of the proceedings in September and December 2014 which arose out of incidents when he had failed to return E after contact. He stated that it was plain that in principle the father should pay the costs of those hearings, although he reduced the sum claimed in respect of the hearing in December. The costs of the hearing in February were again reserved, although the judge observed that in principle the father should pay the costs. He directed the father to pay &#163;2000 within twenty-eight days but suspended the balance for a period of one year.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 27 October 2015, the matter came before Judge Tolson on an application by the mother to reduce staying contact to two weekends in four, and to make other adjustments to the contact arrangements, including the location of the handover at the beginning and end of contact which was moved to the Beaconsfield Services on the M40, having previously been at the Chievely services on the M4. Both parties were represented by counsel. The judge agreed with the mother&#8217;s proposals. The order recorded that the court heard oral evidence from the father about referrals he had made to social services in London and Gloucestershire, the Metropolitan Police, and the NSPCC, and about his allegations relating to the mother&#8217;s care of the child and her mental health issues, including what he described as her narcissistic personality disorder. The order further recited that the court found that there was no substance in any of the father&#8217;s allegations. The father&#8217;s application for permission to appeal the order was refused by the judge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2016, the matter returned to court before Judge Tolson again, this time on the mother&#8217;s further application to reduce contact. She alleged that the father was undermining her relationship with E by saying inappropriate things to her, talking to E about the proceedings, and making E feel responsible for how he felt. On that occasion, the father represented himself, as he has done at all subsequent hearings. The father filed a document at court on the morning of the hearing, running to some 17 closely-typed pages, expanding at length on his contention that the mother was suffering from a narcissistic personality disorder, denying the mother&#8217;s assertion that he was giving instructions to E, accusing the mother of alienating E from him, setting out his further concerns about E&#8217;s behaviour, and asserting that E wanted to live with him and his partner. He referred to an incident when E had alleged that scratches on her face had been caused in a scooter accident when, according to the father, they had again been caused by the mother&#8217;s cat and E had been encouraged by the mother to lie to the father because she feared that he would take the cat away. Having considered the document, and listened to submissions from the mother&#8217;s counsel and the father in person, the judge decided to suspend the previous order and replace it with an order under which E would continue to live with her mother and spend time with her father at a contact centre under the supervision of an experienced supervisor once a fortnight, each visit to be limited to one hour. He directed Cafcass to prepare a s7 report addressing the mother&#8217;s concerns about the father&#8217;s parenting and its impact on the child&#8217;s emotional wellbeing, whether or not the child&#8217;s emotional needs were being met by the father, whether the child had suffered or was at risk of suffering any emotional harm as a result of the father&#8217;s conduct, and whether the father had the capacity to promote a positive image of the mother, and to make recommendations as to future child arrangement orders. He listed the matter for a further hearing in June. The father again applied for permission to appeal and, again, the application was refused.</p>

I do not have a transcript relating to this hearing which is not part of the appeal in this case. It seems, however, that there may have been some minor adjustment in the contact arrangements on this occasion. In addition, as emerges from the transcript of the judgment delivered on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, the judge in June also considered the possibility of instructing a child and family psychiatrist. That proposal, however, foundered, apparently on the grounds of cost. Thereafter, contact continued during the summer on the same supervised basis.</p>

The judge considered the evidence, including a report from a consultant adult psychiatrist, whom the father was consulting with a view to obtaining some therapeutic assistance. The judge also had evidence of the mother that, on a visit to a museum, the father had whispered to his daughter that he was feeling depressed, and that she had subsequently repeated this to the mother. The father strongly denied that any such incident had taken place and relied on the fact that the contact had been supervised by an independent social worker who gave evidence that she did not observe or overhear the father make any inappropriate comments. The judge concluded, however, that the incident had happened, saying:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;I accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that E has told her that during a trip to a museum, notwithstanding close professional supervision, the father was able to whisper into E&#8217;s ear the fact that he, the father, was feeling depressed. This, I think, was an action by the father which he could not control in his desire to let his daughter know his anxieties&#8221;</p>

The judge also ordered that the mother should make sure that E spends such further or other time with the father as maybe agreed in writing between the parties and that &#8220;the development of the contact to unsupervised visiting and/or staying contact shall be determined by the mother in the first instance after giving due consideration to the progress made by the father as a result of his ongoing therapy&#8221;. The judge further ordered that, in the event that either party make any further applications in relation to the care of the child, they shall be allocated to and heard by himself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October 2016, the father filed a notice of appeal against Judge Tolson&#8217;s order of 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October. On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, having received the transcript, I directed that the application for permission to appeal be listed for an oral hearing. On 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2017, I dismissed the application for permission to appeal. In my judgment, I concluded that the judge&#8217;s findings &#8211; and his analysis of the mother and father &#8211; were  manifestly within his discretion. At paragraph 25, I observed;</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;[The judge] saw the parties over several hearings and was therefore fully able to reach an assessment of their evidence. That is essentially a matter for the judge at first instance. The father may not like the judge&#8217;s conclusions, but it is inevitable after the hearing that one party or another &#8211; or both &#8211; is likely to disagree with some or all of the judge&#8217;s analysis. Having looked carefully at the documents, and in particular the transcripts, I can see no reason for an appellate court concluding that this judge&#8217;s assessment of the parties was outside the ambit of his discretion, nor anything to indicate the judge was prejudiced or partial, or that there was any other irregularity in the process.&#8221;</p>

The fact that the judge has repeatedly made findings against the father does not amount to evidence of prejudice. Equally, I am satisfied that this judge was fully aware of the potential disadvantage that the father was in as a litigant in person, and made all allowances for that fact in carrying out his assessment.&#8221;</p>

According to a document which the father has filed, before one visit was due to take place in January 2017 he informed the supervisor that he would be reading E &#8220;The Boy Who Cried Wolf&#8221; and &#8220;talking with her about lying in reference to the scooter accident in the hope that the truth of the matter will then be on the record&#8221;. The contact supervisor wrote to the judge expressing concern about the father&#8217;s behaviour during contact.  On 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, the father applied for a further child arrangements order, seeking staying contact. At a hearing on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March before Judge Tolson, the father informed the court that the contact supervisor had resigned. The judge made an order that the court would consider the appointment of a new supervisor by email. He directed the parties to submit their choice of candidate. He further stated that he would not be re-opening the question of other child arrangements. </p>

I have decided important issues against [the father] in the past, but that does not amount to bias or even an appearance of bias. The father&#8217;s statement in support boils down to the contention that I was against him, and the contention that I was rude to him. I was against him (on the issues) but I was not rude to him. Should any further appeal process result in fresh hearings then I can see that it would be desirable for the matter to be heard by a different judge, but that is another matter. To the extent that [the father&#8217;s] application is for me to recuse myself from any wider consideration of his case now or in future, I refuse that also on the same basis.&#8221;</p>

A transcript of the hearing has been produced. At the outset of the hearing, the judge indicated that the only issue was the identity of the supervisor. The father immediately raised an objection, saying that he had filed a C110 application asking for staying contact but the application had been &#8220;vacated&#8221; without his being given an opportunity to make a submission. The judge indicated that he was not prepared to revisit the issue saying that there was &#8220;nothing fresh in the circumstances&#8221;. The father retorted that &#8220;there is a great deal fresh in the circumstances&#8221; and referred to having obtained a further report. He also claimed that the &#8220;whispering&#8221; allegation was &#8220;a fairy tale&#8221;. He reiterated his request for a different judge to take over the case, stating that &#8220;a fresh pair of eyes on this case are crucial on my daughter&#8221;. The judge maintained his position that he would not reopen the issues, save for the identity of the supervisor. After further exchanges, the father suggested the name of an alternative supervisor and gave some details about that person. He then repeated his contention that supervised contact should never have been started and that the judge had been wrong to allow the mother to make the arrangements because she had proved that her aim was to alienate the child. He asserted that the supervisor&#8217;s report about contact was &#8220;an outrageous piece of fiction&#8221;. Counsel appearing for the mother was then invited to make submissions on the identity of the supervisor and pointed out that this was not the first time that the father had taken exception to someone in the proceedings and that this pattern would continue. For that reason, he submitted that there should be no change of supervisor (the existing supervisor having indicated that she was willing to continue). When the judge indicated to the father that he was minded to agree with this course, the father strongly objected, stating that the supervisor had lied in her reports, that the supervisor was &#8220;ultra-conservative&#8221; and &#8220;not right&#8221; and that E had demonstrated &#8220;a downward spiral in terms of her behaviour&#8221; and was &#8220;becoming feral on your watch&#8221;.</p>

According to the father, he attempted to interrupt and then walked out of court while the judgment was being delivered. The transcript of the judgment records that the judge noted that the history of supervised contact had not been happy because the father had been unable to cooperate with the supervisor&#8217;s requirements; that, on the supervisor&#8217;s accounts, he had been abusive towards her and inappropriate towards E; that nonetheless the supervisor was willing, with a degree of reluctance, to continue if the judge so ordered, but only on strict terms, in particular that the father should not have contact with her before or after the sessions; that the father had attempted to litigate again much broader issues, reopening the whole question of child arrangements  but that the judge had ruled that he was not prepared to allow this. </p>

Again, this afternoon, over the course of a hearing lasting some 40 minutes, it has been extremely difficult to concentrate the father&#8217;s attention on the points in question and to conduct a hearing which permitted both sides to speak. Again, the pressure of speech which [the father] has exhibited as well as the approach which he has taken demonstrate that all the old problems remain.

He said that this was &#8220;effectively sabotaging E&#8217;s relationship with her stepsisters&#8221; and that it &#8220;did not uphold her basic human right to the respect for her family life and it did not respect the original separation agreement&#8221;. In his skeleton argument he explained that, because his partner&#8217;s children spend alternate weekends with their father, the amended order meant that E either spent every contact weekend with them or alternatively never saw them at all. The previous arrangement had worked well because it meant that on some weekends all the children were together and on other weekends when the older girls were away E was able to be just with her baby sister. The father also raised an objection to the judge&#8217;s decision in October 2015 to alter the location of the handover at the start of contact to a place closer to the mother&#8217;s home, arguing that it lengthened E&#8217;s travel time, increased the risk of being caught in traffic, and reduced the time she spent with his family on Friday evenings. </p>

He described the hearing on the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> as a &#8220;bizarre experience&#8221;, and stated that the transcript of the hearing would demonstrate that the judge was biased and that he had not been allowed to make a submission. He said that, when the judge continued giving his judgment without allowing him to make his submissions, he had told him that he did not recognise his jurisdiction and had walked out. The father repeated an assertion which he has made previously that the judge did not understand parental alienation, and that he retained the requirement that contact be supervised when there was no necessity for this, and furthermore that he had retained the same supervisor as before even though the father had complained about her to the regulator and was intending to sue her for libel. The mother had insisted on retaining the supervisor who, the father said, had lied about him &#8211; &#8220;this supervisor is patently working for the millionaire alienating mother&#8221;. He submitted that the choice of supervisor should be a joint decision and that at the hearing he had &#8220;offered him a qualified alternative for his unnecessary supervision and he still went with the proven disruptive liar.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I shall deal with the father&#8217;s various appeals by considering the decisions under appeal in chronological order. I start therefore with the appeal against the costs order made in February 2015. The normal practice in children&#8217;s cases is for the court to make no order for costs, but the court retains the power to make an order if it considers the circumstances so warrant. In this case, the judge made an order for the father to pay part of the costs relating to two hearings at which he had been ordered to return the child after contact. In my judgment, the judge was plainly entitled to take the view that the mother&#8217; costs had been incurred because of the father&#8217;s misconduct in retaining E without agreement and that a costs order was appropriate. It should be noted, however, that the judge carefully did not order the father to pay all the costs claimed, and also suspended part of the payment. The father complains that the second hearing in December was ex parte and the first hearing was also one at which he was unable to make representations. But it was plainly open to the court to make summary orders for return of the child in those circumstances, and the fact that one order was made ex parte and the other on limited notice did not preclude the making of a costs order. I consider the judge&#8217;s decision on costs to be manifestly within his discretion and proportionate. The father is seriously out of time in seeking permission to appeal but, even if he had filed a notice of appeal within the prescribed time limits, there was no prospect of permission to appeal being granted.</p>

Again, I have read the transcript of the hearing and judgment delivered. As stated above, both parties were represented by counsel at that hearing. The decision to reduce contact from 2 weekends in 3 to alternate weekends was made on the basis of the father&#8217;s oral evidence, which did not cover all the issues, and submissions from counsel, without the father having the opportunity to file written evidence. It is well recognised that, using their case management powers, judges may, in appropriate cases, confine the scope of proceedings by limiting the evidence. Indeed, judges are under an obligation only to permit such evidence as they consider necessary to resolve the issues. In doing so, they must of course be careful to ensure that each party receives a fair hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this instance, I do not consider that the course taken by Judge Tolson was wrong or procedurally irregular. By October 2015, he was familiar with the case having held several earlier hearings, and had identified concerns about the father&#8217;s actions. These concerns were increased by the oral evidence he heard from the father about various matters. In the course of argument, the judge considered counsel&#8217;s submission that there should be written evidence &#8211; and a s7 Cafcass report &#8211; and plainly concluded that this was unnecessary and disproportionate, and that the father&#8217;s evidence could be given orally that day. The oral evidence did not cover all the issues which were subsequently ventilated in submissions, but in the course of his testimony the father spoke about his referrals to agencies, his reasons for believing that the mother had a personality disorder, and his concerns about E&#8217;s violent propensities. He was also asked about the circumstances in which he had arranged for E to be baptised without informing the mother. In refusing counsel&#8217;s application for permission to appeal, the judge pointed out that the father had had time since the service of the application to put in written evidence. There had not in fact been any direction for written evidence so the father cannot be criticised for failing to file it before the hearing. But in all the circumstances, I do not consider it unreasonable for the judge to have decided to determine the limited issues before him on the basis of limited oral evidence and submissions from counsel, which,, I note from the transcript, were detailed. The prospective appeal against the order of 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2015 is, of course, seriously out of time. But even if had been made within the prescribed time limits, I see no real prospect of an appellate court interfering with this decision. </p>

Again, I have read the transcript of the hearing and judgment. Having noted in the judgment the mother&#8217;s contention that the father was unable to promote a positive image of her and in fact denigrated her and therefore that the mother now applied to suspend staying contact pending the completion of a Cafcass report, the judge then made these observations:</p>

That has been apparent not in terms of any application before the court but from his submissions to me this morning. When listening to [the father] and when reading the lengthy statement which he has prepared for today&#8217;s hearing, I have to bear in mind that he is a litigant in person and I see him in the raw, if I may put it that way, unfiltered through any legal representative. I have to bear in mind that rough edges in that situation will be exposed that would not be the case if he were represented. Nevertheless, it was justified, in my view for Mr Lazarides, counsel for the mother today, as he has been in the past, to open his submissions with the observation that the father&#8217;s statement perhaps makes the mother&#8217;s case more effectively than anything which she might herself have said. I add that listening to [the father] advance his submissions at this interim hearing, the same point might be made. There is an obsessional and intense nature to almost everything which [he] writes or says of which he himself is quite unaware. It is easy to see how that approach will be carried over into his care of E. He will not see this either.&#8221;</p>

[The father] is unable to see that this is in and of itself an example of the emotional pressure that this little girl must be under.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The judge noted that he had not heard oral evidence, although he had the lengthy written statement from the father and had heard his submissions. He concluded that, on the evidence available at that point, the current contact was of no advantage to E and was in fact a significant detriment. He therefore concluded that he had no alternative but to suspend staying contact. Noting that the father had told him in evidence that he was under the care of the doctor as a result of suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, the judge observed that it would be desirable in E&#8217;s interest for him to obtain a report from a psychiatrist as to his own current mental health.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Once again, the judge took the step of reducing contact without a full hearing. In my judgment, however, he was again entitled to take that step. I agree with his assessment of the father&#8217;s 17-page statement. It does indeed demonstrate the father&#8217;s obsessive nature, lack of self-awareness, and failure to appreciate the impact of his behaviour and attitudes on E herself. I do not agree with the father&#8217;s submission that the evidence to suspend contact and require contact to be supervised was &#8220;woefully insufficient&#8221;. On the contrary, the evidence is plain to see in the father&#8217;s own words. As the judge observed, the mother&#8217;s case for a reduction in contact was made for her by the father&#8217;s own words and actions. The father&#8217;s application for permission to appeal against this order is again significantly out of time but, even if it had been made within the prescribed time limits, it would have had no chance of success. </p>

The father asserts that a study of the various transcripts demonstrates that the judge is biased. I have read the transcripts. I do not agree that there is any evidence of bias.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a fallacious argument. The fact that a judge makes a decision which one party does not like does not mean that he is biased. It is very common for a judge to decide all points in a case in favour of one party. That again is not evidence of bias. The father&#8217;s argument that the judge must be biased because he has accepted the mother&#8217;s arguments on every occasion merely demonstrates the problems which this father has in accepting that there is any valid view other than his own.  The judge dismissed the application that he should recuse himself stating that there was no rational basis for saying that he was biased. I agree.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I come finally to the hearing on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April 2017. The judge took the decision that the only issue with which he was going to deal at the hearing was the identity of the contact supervisor. He summarily refused the father&#8217;s renewed application for staying contact. Having carefully read the documents filed by the father in support of his appeal, and all the transcripts, I am entirely satisfied that the judge was fully entitled to take this course. The father was only seeking to re-litigate issues which had been decided on an earlier occasion. I have considered the arguments which he put forward at the hearing, and in support of his proposed appeal, but in truth they amount to little more than a repetition of the arguments he had advanced at an earlier stage, together with his repeated assertion that the judge was biased. The judge&#8217;s observation about the father&#8217;s manner of speech, and the difficulties that had arisen during the hearing as result of the father&#8217;s approach, are fully supported by the transcript. The judge&#8217;s determination to persist with some form of contact, if possible, so that E could continue to have some sort of relationship with her father, is notable. His decision to continue with the same supervisor was plainly within his discretion. As stated above, she had spoken in her reports about how the father was able to make the contact experience a positive one for E. There is, in my view, no prospect whatsoever of an appellate court interfering with the judge&#8217;s decision on 21 April 2017.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, Judge Tolson has conducted a number of hearings in very difficult circumstances. From reading the papers and the transcripts of all the hearings, I conclude that the judge was fully entitled to reach the view that the principal responsibility for the difficulties lay with the father. The judge has concluded that the father&#8217;s principal allegation, that the mother was alienating E from him, was unjustified, that the father has pursued a course of conduct that has caused, and is likely to cause, emotional harm to his daughter, that he lacks any real insight into the consequences of his behaviour, and as a result his contact needs to be supervised for the time being. I find that the judge&#8217;s assessment is fully supported by the documents put before me, and the transcripts of the various hearings. The judge has elected to deal summarily with the applications put before him at a number of the hearings. While all judges have to be careful when taking this course to ensure that the parties receive a fair hearing, I find that in this instance the judge&#8217;s approach on each occasion was both proportionate and fair.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In taking this course, Judge Tolson is not biased. He has formed an assessment of the merits of the case and made orders that he considers to be in the interests of E&#8217;s welfare. The fact that the judge has decided to accept the mother&#8217;s evidence and arguments on every occasion does not mean that he is biased. On more than one occasion, he has expressed regret that the consequences are that E&#8217;s contact with the father and other members of the family, including her sister, is limited, but he has concluded that significant restrictions on contact are unavoidable because of the father&#8217;s attitude and behaviour. I see no grounds whatsoever for saying that there is any real prospect of a successful appeal against any of the orders about which the father now complains to this court. Permission to appeal is therefore refused.</p>

The time has come for the father to reflect on his own conduct. He should change his approach and focus his efforts on doing his best to ensure that his contact with his daughter is a happy and rewarding experience for her. If he continues the battle in the way that he has done for the last few years, his relationship with E will be permanently damaged, to the lasting detriment of both of them.</p>
