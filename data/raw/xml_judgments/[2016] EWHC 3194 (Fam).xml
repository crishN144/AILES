The precise details do not matter but the mother was quite badly injured.  On [a later date], the father pleaded guilty to an offence of Actual Bodily Harm in respect of the incident.  He was sentenced to perform a period of community service.  This, he did, and he also underwent an anger management course.  Sometime after that violent incident, the parties were reconciled and they lived together for a further three years or so.

According to the mother, however, B, who was by now aged five, began to express reluctance at going to contact with the father because he, B, told the mother that he was being bullied by one of the father&#8217;s now partner&#8217;s children.  His anxiety was seemingly compounded when, whilst in the father&#8217;s care during contact, one of a number of newly-born puppies died in some way and it appears that the father may have levelled what B perceived to be some blame in his, B&#8217;s, direction.  </span></p>

It was agreed between the mother and D, that D would have the children for two hours on Boxing Day when the father would also be able to see them.  However, a contemporaneous message from D to the mother makes it clear that the father did not turn up at D&#8217;s house to see the children.  He accepts that he did not do so and had gone out with his mates on both Christmas day and Boxing Day.  He says that D did not tell him of the arrangement.  The result was that the children did not see their father at all over Christmas 2015 as the mother had planned for him to do.  </span></p>

I find that it is.  She has clearly thought about all aspects of the move and was well on top of all necessary information when she was asked about it in the witness box.  She has made all the usual enquiries that are made in these cases about accommodation, schooling, health care, visas and so forth.  She has budgeted and has satisfied herself that living in the United States on Mr Y&#8217;s income of $30,000 a year or so net, is doable (allowing for necessary expenditure on schooling, health insurance and their religious tithe).  It seems to me that she would have more money to live on, or at any rate no less, than in her current situation whereby in this country she is on state benefits of &#163;9,600 per annum, net of having her housing paid.

In reaching a conclusion about why the father&#8217;s contact has been so sporadic, she says this at paragraphs 39 to 41 of her report:</span></p>

However to date this has not happened for two main reasons.  [The father&#8217;s] youngest child has suffered health problems from birth and spent time in hospital which resulted in [the father] focusing his attention on this child and taking the opportunity to see B and C, when they spend time with their paternal grandmother [D].  On other occasions when the father was in a position to see B and C, the mother would inform him that the children did not wish to spend time with him.  In my view the children are too young to make such decisions for themselves and, with some encouragement from their mother, they would enjoy spending time with their father and his family.  I feel that the mother is not promoting the contact between the children and their father and this [the application to relocate the children] may be an attempt on her behalf to make it easier for her to take the children out of the country.  In my view, this is not prioritising the needs of the children and instead is focusing on her own needs.&#8221;  </span></p>

It turns on the disputed evidence of the mother and father as to whether the mother was difficult about contact or whether the father was uncommitted.  Some assistance can be found, however, from the contemporaneous social messages in the bundle which I have considered in detail.  They have shed some light on the dynamic between the mother and the father as it existed via D, who acted as an intermediary.  I do not see obstructiveness on the mother&#8217;s part in these messages.  When she was asked things by D about the children, she can be seen replying, for the most part, civilly and reasonably and, again, for the most part, essentially agreeing to what was being requested of her.  </span></p>

There, one sees a reference to the father&#8217;s messages being expressly ignored.  However, the mother was adamant that these were not her messages in response to the father&#8217;s queries.  She told me that the messages in question, as shown by their colour, required an iPhone and that she has never had an iPhone.  I therefore called for the father&#8217;s phone, from which it would be apparent to what destination his messages were being sent when they were seemingly being ignored.  It transpired however that his phone is currently in pawn in a local pawn shop.  We lost about half a day whilst efforts were made to retrieve the mobile phone from the pawn shop.  At one point the father was going to retrieve it and bring it to court, but for some ill-explained reason that did not actually happen.  Short of adjourning this hearing for his phone to be retrieved and for any such expertise to be employed as would be necessary to ascertain where he was sending the messages and whether it was the mother who was replying (which nobody asked me to do and which would scarcely be proportionate) I am quite unable to resolve this issue.  The only safe, indeed the only available course, is to put it wholly out of mind which I have done.  I do not consider that, in the grand scheme of things, the point is ultimately anything approaching pivotal.  </span></p>

I do not see comments to the mother from D along the lines that &#8216;&#8230; [the father] wants such and such contact&#8217;, or &#8216;&#8230;[the father] thinks that you are not being reasonable&#8217;.  The sequence of contact (above) itself confirms this impression obtained from the social media exchanges: long gaps when the father was not seeking contact and, as I find, not phoning nor sending cards or gifts (although he told me he would be storing up cards and gifts up until he next saw the children).  He accepts that he has never attended a parent day at school and has only been to the school the once, immediately after the first directions hearing in respect of the mother&#8217;s application.  He does not support the children, although he says that he buys things for them when they are with him.  It is established on clear evidence that he failed to make any arrangements to see the children over Christmas 2015 and did not, in the event, see them at all.  Whilst he may have good reason for not collecting C from the nursery on the first two occasions (as agreed in September 2016) due to his nan&#8217;s death, there is no adequate explanation for his going back on the agreement, at least not without telling D and/or the school and getting them so to inform the mother.  </span></p>

Mrs McCourt accepted this when I asked her some questions about her report and she accepted that her first suggested explanation for the father&#8217;s sporadic contact (cited at para 41 above) was not, in fact, a particularly persuasive one.  </span></p>

D has been a key figure in the dynamics of the relationship between the mother and the father and as a go-between in respect of contact.  She would have a very clear impression as to why contact has been so sporadic.  Indeed, she made her views quite clear in writing on social media to the effect that it is sometimes down to her son&#8217;s disorganisation and lack of consistency: see, for example, &#8216;miscellaneous bundle&#8217; page 37 and page 39.  At the first of these reference points, D refers to the father (her son) as &#8216;a nightmare&#8217;.  She accepts (I paraphrase) that he has had a lot on his hands with baby Z:</span></p>

That, however, as she accepted when I asked her some questions, depends on disputed factual issues between the parties.  Such issues must be a matter for the court to determine, having heard and assessed all the evidence, and not a matter for the CAFCASS officer to determine.</span></p>

In the second such situation, the benefits of a proposed relocation may weigh more heavily in the balance than in the first such situation.  </span></p>

If he had been, I find it would have happened much more regularly and more consistently.  There are, I accept, some inconsistencies in the mother&#8217;s evidence as to the sequence of contact, which I have tried to set out above; but, by and large, I accept her case that she has been generally speaking willing to agree that contact which the father asked for via D.  I accept her evidence that she would want her children to know their father and their paternal family.  Where the evidence of the father and the mother differs, I therefore prefer the mother&#8217;s.  This finding clearly has an impact on Mrs McCourt&#8217;s recommendation.  She agreed with me that if I were to find the facts in the way that I have done, then there would be a likelihood that her recommendation about relocation would or could have been different.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">In the last analysis, the pros and cons here are, as they generally are in relocation cases, essentially as follows.  As to the pros, the mother would be able to live where she wants to live and with her husband, by whom she is pregnant, and with whom she wishes to make her life.  Looked at in isolation (and that is emphatically not the way to look at it), this would be better for the children than if the mother were to have to continue to live in England, kept away from her husband by virtue of what she would regard as the father&#8217;s unreasonable opposition to her wish to move and make a new life.  As always in these cases, the degree of the mother&#8217;s contentment, or not, with her own life, will be likely to bear on the best interests of the children.  As to the cons, any relocation would inevitably cause a very considerable erosion in the amount of contact which the children would be able to have with their father and the ease with which they would be able to see him, as compared with if the parties were still living in the same town, as they do at the present time.  The children would also have to move from a familiar environment and adapt to a new school/nursery in a different education system.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Carrying out this balance and by reason of the findings which I have made as to the essentially irregular and sporadic nature of the father&#8217;s contact, I have come to the conclusion that the pros of relocating are weightier than the cons.  I accept Mr Adamson&#8217;s submission when he described as &#8216;idealised&#8217; Mrs McCourt&#8217;s hopes for future contact if the mother and the children continued to live in this country.  Based on the history and track-record of the case, those hopes are less likely to be fulfilled than likely to be fulfilled.  I pay due respect to Mrs McCourt&#8217;s opinion.  She has been 14 years a social worker, out of which she has been five years, a Children&#8217;s Guardian.  However, on this occasion, for the reasons set out above, I consider I can properly depart from her recommendation and, indeed, should do in the best interests of the children.  Her opinion was formed on a basis in her mind that this case involves, in effect, a difficult and obstructive mother; whereas having heard all the evidence and seeing the parties cross-examined (and having cross-examined the mother myself on the father&#8217;s behalf), I have differed from that particular conclusion.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">I am conscious that the mother said that one possibility, if relocation was refused, would be that Mr Y might see his way to relocating here; but she told me of the likely visa difficulties.  In any event, it would be putting her and Mr Y into a situation which is not how they wish to plan their lives and it would be happening for the advantages of contact, when contact looks likely on the history to revert to being irregular and unreliable, once the focus of this application has been taken away.  I am satisfied, looking at the Article 8 rights of all involved that a relocation, although it would be an interference with the father&#8217;s rights, would be proportionate and necessary and in the interests of giving effect to the Article 8 rights of the children.  For these various reasons and on the basis of the undertakings and conditions which were discussed during the course of the hearing, I do therefore propose to allow this application so that the mother&#8217;s relocation of the children can go ahead.  </span></p>
