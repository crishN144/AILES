	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the separation of the parties the father instituted proceedings in 2019 for an order that the children live with him as well as a specific issue order regarding their education. Those proceedings were concluded in February 2020.  The District Judge decided that the children should live with their mother and have regular contact with the father. He determined that they were well settled with their mother and that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that they would be better off in mainstream education as the father hoped rather than the home-schooling which had previously been agreed. The other findings are helpfully set out at paragraph 8 of the judgment under appeal.</p>

It was that application which came before the court towards the end of 2023.  </p>

Thus the argument was about which parent could better meet the needs of the children. The geographical distance between the parents&#8217; respective homes meant that inevitably they would live with one parent and spend only weekend and holiday contact with the other.</p>

Dr Matthews acknowledged that she had not conducted an autism assessment of the boys which would have been necessary to confirm a diagnosis or its absence, but said that the children did not fulfil the criteria for ASD.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The judge criticised Dr Matthews as arriving at her conclusion based upon a relatively short interaction with them in which she says she did not observe any relevant ASD traits during her interview. It was, said the judge, from that premise that Dr Matthews went on to conclude that the mother has therefore diagnosed the children with a need that they do not have and treated them accordingly.</p>

The judge said it was wholly unfair for the mother to be criticised for this. She did not accept that the mother had labelled the boys as autistic or viewed through the lens of having special needs. She said that there was no evidence that that the mother had presented her views of their condition to the children in a negative way or not given them positive messages about their own abilities.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At paragraph 40 of the judgment the judge criticised Dr Matthews for expressing an opinion as to which parent the children should live with. She said that at the most Dr Matthews should have limited comment to the ability of the parents to meet the children&#8217;s needs. It would then be for the Guardian and court to consider her advice and how it fitted in all with the issues that the court had to determine.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment the recorder was wrong to write off Dr Matthews in the way that she did. Dr Matthews is a very experienced child psychologist and whilst not an expert on ASD has had significant experience in dealing with it. She was entitled to tell the court that she saw no evidence of ASD traits in either child.  In doing that she was not going beyond her instructions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was also wrong of the judge to say that there was no evidence of the mother presenting the children as potentially having autism or ASD traits. During her interview with Dr Matthews the mother spoke to her about the boys&#8217; autistic traits as if they had been diagnosed and referred to consulting a professional diagnostic manual and stating that she felt that the children presented with a high number of diagnostic criteria.</p>

This was the mother reporting to the GP, and, as Dr Matthews said, was not consistent with her experience of talking to and spending some time with B. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One of the features of the children&#8217;s life with their mother was the absence of friends. Both boys told Dr Matthews that they did not have friends outside the family. This was a concern to Dr Matthews as children need to have a range of social experiences to learn from and support them through their future.  The judge discounted this concern as being the inevitable consequence of home-schooling which the parents had once agreed upon.  But, it is hard to see their involvement with an organisation which caters specifically for children with disabilities and for which the mother had signed up the children, as providing a rounded social experience.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment the issue of whether the mother had an avoidant coping style so as to undermine the children&#8217;s relationship with her father was a less important issue, and it is not necessary to spend time on it.  There were multiple examples of the mother expressing the view that the father was dangerous to her and the children. Those views were expressed to adults, principally professionals so far as I can tell, as opposed to the children.  Nevertheless it is clear that the children retain a close relationship with their father, as indeed they do with their mother. I am not aware of any evidence that the mother has sought to interfere with the children&#8217;s contact with their father. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Guardian supported the father&#8217;s application for a change of residence. She had long experience of this family, having acted in the first round of the proceedings in 2019.  She had met the children on a number of occasions in both sets of proceedings. In the course of her evidence the Guardian set out her analysis and reasons justifying a change of residence. Thus, for the judge to describe her evidence as being wholly reliant on the report and evidence of Dr Matthews was not fair to her. That does not mean that her evidence had to be accepted but it should have been given weight.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am left with the clear impression that the judge was led into error by her approach to Dr Matthews&#8217; assessment.  Dr Matthews&#8217; opinion was largely based upon the content of her interviews with the family members and the assessments that she conducted. Instead the judge provided an over-focus on the underlying factual basis of the assessment and an under-focus on the factors which led to Dr Matthews&#8217; findings.  It was the assessment itself that was the basis of Dr Matthews&#8217; recommendations rather than the underlying factual matrix.</p>

It is not open to me to substitute my own discretion for that of the trial judge. Only if a judge has exceeded their own reasonable band of discretion, come to a plainly wrong conclusion, taken into account irrelevant matters, or failed to take into account material matters will the appeal court interfere.</p>

After judgment was given a notice of appeal was filed on 26 March 2024.  The urgency was not spotted so that the application for permission to appeal was not put before me until 5 June 2024.  I gave directions immediately and the matter was heard three weeks later but it is regrettable that there has been any delay.</p>

As I understand it the father does not at the moment have places for both children. I shall need to hear submissions as to what should happen in respect of the children&#8217;s education in the time between now and a rehearing and what directions should be made, either by me or whoever will next hear the matter in Derby, to progress the matter as quickly as possible.  There are no winners in this situation only losers, above all the children who have been out of mainstream schooling for far too long.</p>
