	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with two girls N, who is nearly 11 and L who is 6. Their mother is represented by Ms Mills, counsel. Their father is represented by Ms Bhari.  The family are of Eritrean origin both the mother and father having left that country when they were children. The mother is now a British citizen. The father is a Dutch citizen. The girls had another sister, A, who tragically died of meningitis in 2009. The family&#8217;s African origins lie at the heart of the applications which have come before me over the last three days for determination. </p>

By that application the mother sought to amend an existing child arrangements order to enable her to move with the children to Ethiopia in time for the children to start school in September 2017. That application has been overtaken by the passage of time such that the mother now seeks permission to relocate with the children to Uganda in time for them to start school in September 2018. On the first day of this three-day final hearing I was told that the father now agreed to the children relocating to live in Uganda. It was also agreed that the children should continue to spend time with the father for half of the school Christmas, Easter and summer holidays. Further it was agreed that the children should have indirect contact twice a week by phone or Skype.  Subject to some other minor drafting type points the main substantive issues that remained to be determined are as follows</p>

It became clear that the Cafcass report had not been commissioned and that the expert, Dr Campbell, had indicated that some areas of the report requested were outside his expertise. I gave further directions in particular to seek to identify a suitably qualified legal practitioner in Ethiopia and Eritrea to file a report on the issues of recognition and enforcement of an English order.

He also said that he was concerned about their safety and well-being in Ethiopia given the historic disputes between Ethiopia and Eritrea and the risks to Eritreans living in Ethiopia. </p>

She said that she had extended family in Uganda including her father who runs a business there. Her mother would also be moving to Uganda with her and they would be joining extended family all living in the same private estate and the children attending the same international school as other family members.</p>

For the purposes of this hearing the mother has instructed Ms Mills through the Bar Pro Bono Unit. The father has instructed Ms Bhari. I have been provided with a bundle of documents prepared by the mother although I had provided in my earlier order that the practice direction bundle should be prepared by the father&#8217;s solicitors if the mother was in person. Ms Mills filed a position statement in advance of the hearing. Ms Bhari told me that she was only instructed late on Friday 29 June 2018 and she provided a position statement on Tuesday morning.</p>

Given the main issue of substance to which her report was addressed, namely relocation to Uganda, was agreed this in the event did not present any obstacle to the conclusion of the case. Neither Ms Mills or Ms Bhari suggested that the matter should be adjourned for her to give evidence and I was satisfied that it was appropriate to proceed without her giving oral evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given that the substantive application for relocation to Uganda is now agreed I do not intend to set out the law relating to permanent relocation. The welfare of the children is paramount and the fact that the parents have agreed to the relocation is a powerful indicator that such a move would be in their welfare interests. However that does not absolve the court of the task of considering whether on the evidence such a move is in their welfare interests. Having regard to the evidence I have read and heard I&#8217;m quite satisfied that it is in these children&#8217;s best interests to relocate with their mother to Uganda to build a new life there. The mother is plainly dedicated to the children, capable, has made plans for the meeting of their physical, emotional and educational needs in Uganda and the children wish to go. The contact with their father can clearly be maintained at least at the current level and so it is in their interests to make the move.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both Ms Mills and Ms Bhari agree that the court can and should exercise its jurisdiction to make child arrangements orders dealing with the time that the children are to have with their father.  Both are agreed that the correct approach is that set out in the cases relating to removals from the jurisdiction for holidays in non-Hague convention countries. Given this court is exercising substantive jurisdiction over the children based on their habitual residence and is contemplating the authorisation of the children spending time away from their primary carer with their father in Eritrea it seems to me that counsel's agreement on this approach must be correct.  The court is undertaking a welfare exercise of an identical nature to that which it would be undertaking if the father were seeking to take the children from the UK to Eritrea. The fact that the children will be based permanently in Uganda and the children will be taken from Uganda to Eritrea does not alter the essential nature of the evaluation but merely the evidence which is relevant to it. I did at the outset moot the possibility of it being more appropriate for the Ugandan court to determine this issue given they might have more direct experience of the issue given their geographical location. However enquiries with Mr Emmanuel disclosed that he had no direct experience of the Ugandan courts dealing with such applications or the movement of children from Uganda to Eritrea and back again in the context of family proceedings. In those circumstances it seems to me right for this court to determine the issue at this stage. </p>

Where (as in most cases) there is some risk of abduction and an obvious detriment to the child if that risk were to materialise the court has to be positively satisfied that the advantages to the child of her visiting that country outweigh the risks to her welfare which the visit will entail. This will therefore routinely involved the court in investigating what safeguards can be put in place to minimise the risk of retention and to secure the child&#8217;s return if that transpires. Those safeguards should be capable of having a real and tangible effect in the jurisdiction in which they are to operate and be capable of being easily accessed by the UK-based parent".</span></p>

She says he is more interested in his rights than in the welfare of the children at times and that there is a not to be ignored possibility that he might retain the children in Eritrea if he felt that his rights were in issue. The mother also relies on the issue raised by Dr Campbell, namely the possibility that the state itself might step in to prevent the children leaving, they being entitled to Eritrean citizenship and being susceptible to compulsory conscription.</p>

It is a country with which they are not familiar, their familiarity with language is limited, they have very few family members on either the paternal or maternal side there and it is a country which is not a modern democratic state but rather a one-party dictatorship with all the problems and risks that entails. The mother recognises that there are some benefits to the children in visiting Eritrea; being able to see their father's home and the factory and businesses he runs, seeing their paternal grandfather and step-grandmother in their home and getting exposure both to Asmara as a city and the language and culture would all be benefits. However the mother says that they are limited given the absence from that country of all of the extended family and the ability of the children to imbibe cultural and linguistic aspects of Eritrean life from their extended family in other countries.</p>

Ms Mills says that the explanation on Eritrean laws gives rise to substantial doubt as to whether the system allows for the equivalent of a mirror order or advance registration. She emphasises that the explanation addresses the question of execution of judgments which suggests a process which would take place after the event of an abduction. In that case Ms Mills relies on the uncertainty in Mr Gebru&#8217;s report as to whether in fact an English order could be executed given the uncertainty over whether an Eritrean judgment could be executed in the UK.

In approaching the evidence, I determine any disputed matter on the balance of probabilities; i.e. is it more likely than not that an event occurred, or occurred as described by the mother or father. In considering the evidence I have to consider the credibility of the parties by reference to the consistency of their account internally, consistency with other known facts, whether they have a motive to exaggerate or suppress the truth and how they gave their account. I remind myself that a person may lie about one matter but may be reliable on other matters.</p>

In her oral evidence she was open and frank, with a tendency to give too much detail rather than to suppress information. Her description of events over the course of 2012 was spontaneous, detailed and had a ring of authenticity to it. Her account tied in with contemporary documents in particular for instance the emails in 2014. She is clearly dedicated to the children. That she amended her planned move to Ethiopia to take account of the father&#8217;s concerns indicates that she is willing to compromise and to take account of other people&#8217;s views. Overall I considered her to be an honest witness, occasionally in error as to dates, but generally to be relied upon.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father was far less straightforward as a witness. His opening line was that he lived in Holland. On closer examination it became quite clear that he does not live in Holland but rather he lives most of his time in Eritrea at least eight or nine months a year but visits Holland extensively combining his time there with his visits to see the children, with business and with visiting extended family. He was far less comfortable giving evidence, was far less open and often sought to avoid giving a straight answer and was on occasions under cross examination by Ms Mills argumentative. He was much less spontaneous with detail and at times I found it very hard to follow the logic in what he was saying. In particular in relation to the alleged family trips in Europe to Germany or Euro-Disney I was unable to grasp what the father&#8217;s case actually was. I got the impression that he was improvising. His evidence in relation to the children was far less child-centred. He appeared to be preoccupied at times with his rights and appeared to resent the mother exercising any form of control over him. However he appeared not to recognise the imposition on the mother of not permitting her to live where she chose whilst having complete freedom himself to live where he chose. I do not consider the father to be a reliable witness, but rather someone who is capable of moulding his evidence to suit his ultimate goals. That is not to say that I consider that he would deliberately harm the children in any way. He plainly loves them and they love him. However I detect a very strong streak of pride and determination in him which may at times lead him to insist upon his strict rights thus obscuring his focus on the children&#8217;s welfare. His approach to the children starting school in Uganda in September of this year but also his approach to his right in January 2015 are prime examples of this.</p>

		  <p>As a result of the father&#8217;s redundancy M and F discuss F relocating to London from Switzerland which is he does not wish to do.   They therefore looked at other options in particular relocating to Africa which was something they had been thinking about as a long-term goal for some time. The father was clear in his oral evidence that he only considered relocating to Eritrea. He said in terms that this was what the parties had decided they would do. However he then conceded that the mother was not happy that Eritrea should be the only option and so it was agreed that she would travel in the Summer to explore the possibilities.  M goes to Uganda and Eritrea for 2 weeks. F cares for children in Switzerland. Upon the mother&#8217;s return she proposes family relocate to Uganda. The father was not happy with this he preferring Eritrea. His father already owned a business there which he wanted to become involved in. In September F travels to Eritrea and on return again proposed family relocate to Eritrea. No agreement reached; M prefers options her father and family can offer in Uganda and F prefers option his family can offer in Eritrea. In December M travelled  to Eritrea. I believe this was because the mother was seeking to find a compromise, she being far more flexible in her approach than the father. However after having looked at matters on the ground in Eritrea she concluded she would not wish to relocate the children and herself there. On M&#8217;s return, F was very cross that the mother had refused to agree a move to Eritrea. The father left the family home that day. It was quite clear from his evidence that he viewed this as a breach of what he considered was an agreement to relocate to Eritrea. It is clear from the M&#8217;s evidence she had never agreed to move to Eritrea but rather had agreed to consider Eritrea.  I accept the mother&#8217;s account the father returned to Holland very angry that his plan had not been accepted. </p>

		  <p>At some point in the summer of 2013 the father made the move to Eritrea. </p>
		  <p>I accept that the M was unable to contact F in Eritrea and he is not around to see the children. Whether this is because he was being difficult, or whether he had not provided contact details because the mother was only contacting Holland I cannot determine. </p>
		  <p>The father&#8217;s evidence on this was most unusual. He says he was in contact with the girls roughly twice weekly prior to going but that he didn&#8217;t tell the mother (or presumably the girls) because she already knew he was moving to Eritrea as it had been agreed by her previously. This illustrates both his inability to accommodate any other view than his own and how difficult he could be even if it meant sacrificing the children&#8217;s welfare to his own pride.</p>
		  <p><span/></p>
		  <p>Given the father was not seeing the children in England and had relocated to Eritrea it is hardly surprising that the mother chose to pursue a relocation to Africa herself. Given that he was providing not a penny of financial support to the mother was an additional reason for her seeking to rely on her own resources in order to build a stable life for herself and children. Given that it would bring the children closer to where the father was in practical terms was a benefit. </p>
		  <p>I accept that the mother did not obtain the father&#8217;s consent and in legal terms it may have been a wrongful removal although it might well have been argued that the father had given up the exercise of his rights of custody given his behaviour over the preceding months. </p>
		  <p>In any event the net result was that M relocates and children enter school in Ethiopia and she starts work. They developed a new life in Ethiopia. The fact that they continue to mention the existence of a dog to the Cafcass officer and missing him indicates in a small way the extent to which they became settled in Ethiopia.</p>
		  <p>I accept that there was a period of time when the father was unable to communicate with the mother as a result of this move. I do not accept that it was for as long as three months that may have been more like six weeks. M says she was unable to contact him and she left her contact details with sister who gave them to H as soon as he contacted the family flat. There plainly was contact taking place by about October because arrangements were made for the children to return to London in order to see their father.</p>

If you go to Ethiopia without settling this issue, or at least know where we stand with the matter of the children, I will have but no choice to go via a lawyer and will instruct the lawyer that I haven&#8217;t given you the permission nor that I agree that you take the children away from me to Ethiopia. It is all about the kids, we need to settle this matter for the sake of the children make sure that they get to spend quality time with me without the supervision. The father sent a copy of a separation agreement with that which included that any change in the residence of the children can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t be made without his consent, that he is to visit the children at any time which will be agreed beforehand, there will be no country restriction as to where I can spend or take my children during their holidays...&#8221;</span></p>

		  <p>The net effect of this letter and the mother&#8217;s refusal to agree to its demands was that the father refused to allow the children to return to their home in Ethiopia. Thus having travelled to London for a holiday in the full expectation that they would return to their schools, home and environment in Ethiopia they ended up back in England having to put together their lives here again.  Given that the father had done nothing to require the children&#8217;s return from Ethiopia between the end of 2013 and the end of 2014 and had thus acquiesced in their making their home in Ethiopia the mother would have been within her legal rights to have returned immediately to Ethiopia. However again perhaps because of erroneous legal advice but I conclude also because the mother seeks to find a consensual way forward with the father if at all possible she accepted she should remain here until the matter was concluded. In the event it took until November 2015 before a court order was agreed and even then it did not provide for her to relocate with the children back to Ethiopia.</p>

They have reintegrated into their school (it being interesting to note that their English school observed that N&#8217;s performance had improved following her period of time in private education in Ethiopia). The children have seen their father in Holland on a regular basis for a week at Christmas, for a week at Easter and for half of the summer holidays spending time with their extended paternal family, aunts and uncles and cousins in Holland. They have also been able to see their grandfather and step-grandmother in Holland. I do not accept the father&#8217;s account of the supposedly difficulties is which he says he either has or will face in Holland in relation to the passports. As I&#8217;ve already said I found it difficult to follow his evidence in relation to the family trips to Germany or Disney. Within the Schengen area travel documents would not be required being a borderless area. As a Dutch citizen I do not understand how the father would face difficulties accessing health or other resources in Holland and nor do I see why he would need to produce passports to check into a hotel.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Campbell&#8217;s report and his oral evidence were ultimately only of relatively limited assistance. He is not an expert in Ethiopian or Eritrean law. He is an anthropologist and has expertise in the state of the country and in particular in relation to human rights issues. He expressed concerns about the ability of the Eritrean legal system to recognise and enforce a foreign order. He noted that the courts were not independent of the executive, and all judges were appointed by the executive. In particular he was concerned that the children as Eritrean citizens might be subject to both exit controls and to the risk of conscription. Having heard the mother&#8217;s evidence and the father&#8217;s evidence and Dr Campbell&#8217;s acceptance that his knowledge of the laws of Eritrea had to be judged in context of real-life experience it seems to me that the risks to the children of the state interfering in their lives either by refusing an exit Visa or by conscription are limited. Dr Campbell noted that there had been positive developments in the border dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia and thus travel may becoming easier and the risk of conflict less. However it is quite clear from his evidence that Eritrea remains a one-party state with none of the normal checks and balances in a modern democracy and where the courts cannot be viewed as truly independent of the executive. The risk of sudden changes in attitude of the authorities cannot therefore be ruled out.</p>

He also notes that the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) (General Application) Order 35/2002 reinforces that position. He confirmed that such an application did not require the children to be present in Uganda and that the process could commence shortly after an order was made by this court. He noted that the cost would be US$2000. He also observed that the vacation period is due to commence for a month running from 15 July and that in order to push the process through during vacation it would cost a further US$500. The net effect of his evidence is that it seems highly probable that any order I make will be registered and enforced by the Ugandan courts will but the time frame that cannot be guaranteed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence of Mr Gebru on Eritrean law is that the courts of Eritrea are able to execute foreign judgments and awards. Articles 456 to 461 of the Transitional Civil Procedure Code make provision for this. There are five conditions for allowing an application. Firstly that the execution of Eritrean judgment is allowed in the country in which the judgment to be executed was given. Mr Gebru observes that the other four conditions are likely to be fulfilled at but there is an issue over the first condition I have just outlined. There is of course no reciprocal enforcement arrangement between Eritrea and England and Wales although an application could be made under the inherent jurisdiction relating to children for recognition of an Eritrean children order; although that would only be recognised by the English court if it was satisfied following its own evaluation that the order itself was in the welfare interests of the child. Ms Mills notes that the terminology in Mr Gebru&#8217;s report relating as it does to execution creates an issue over whether advance recognition, registration or a mirror order can be obtained. It appears that the process would not be lengthy or expensive according to Mr Gebru&#8217;s evidence.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The magnitude of the risks which face the children if they visit Eritrea are different depending on what risk one considers. I consider the risks of the children being denied an exit Visa or of being subjected to compulsory conscription in Eritrea to be very low having regard to the reality of the family&#8217;s ability to travel into and out of Eritrea and to avoid conscription. However it is not non-existent, and given the nature of Eritrea as a state there is always the possibility of sudden change. I also consider the risk of the father retaining the children in Eritrea to be low but not non-existent. There are a number of instances of the father prioritising his rights over the children&#8217;s welfare in particular in January 2015 when he was prepared to uproot the children from the lives they had embedded themselves in in Ethiopia in order to insist on a separation agreement or a court dictated outcome as to their future. I have no doubt that this was harmful to them and was a significant failing in the father&#8217;s ability to prioritise the children&#8217;s welfare. There are other instances, not least the father cutting off the children when he didn&#8217;t get his own way over the relocation to Eritrea. I therefore have to consider that there is a possibility that for reasons of his own the father might see some advantage in keeping the children in Eritrea in order to extract some concession from the mother in some shape or form.</p>

He is not sufficiently focused on the children, and that may be a reflection of the fact that he has not been an integral component of their lives but has lived away in a different country for the majority of their young lives. He chose to move to Eritrea alone rather than to pursue a course which would have led to him being more involved in their lives. This is another indication of him doing what suits him rather than what suits the children. I appreciate there may be practical limitations on his ability to work in certain countries but his leaving on his own in December 2012 and moving to Eritrea did not prioritise the children. There are therefore limitations in his capability. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I consider that the mother will promote contact with the father whether or not an order is registered in the courts of Uganda. My conclusions on her ability to focus on the children and their need for a relationship with their father more than satisfies me that she will ensure the contact with the father takes place whether or not an order is registered in the Ugandan courts. In order to ensure that a regime is in place though I will require that the order is registered in Uganda. I do not consider that it needs to be done before the mother and children leave.  It is plainly in their welfare interests to commence school at the beginning of term rather than to play catch up both in terms of lessons but also friendship groups by joining after the beginning of term. This is another example of the father&#8217;s inability to see it from the children&#8217;s point of view. The costs of registering the order shall be shared. If the father wants to expedite it he should be responsible for the additional &#163;500 cost of doing so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to travel to Eritrea and the father having the passports it will be evident from my evaluation of the three Re R conditions that the existence of a risk of the children not returning from Eritrea combined with the magnitude of the consequences, and the absence of security strongly point away from granting permission. The welfare benefits to the children of visiting Eritrea clearly exist but they are limited in extent given the fact that their extended paternal family primarily lives in Holland or elsewhere and they are able to experience Eritrean culture away from Eritrea. I therefore consider that the welfare balance falls clearly against granting permission to the father to take the children to Eritrea. I do not consider that making a conditional order (on the condition that the father obtained a mirror order and provided security in Eritrea) would be appropriate given the state of the evidence. Nor do I consider that it is appropriate to make provision for the children to visit in three years&#8217; time. I believe the mother's concession that she would be prepared to agree to this was driven by her desire to seek compromise with the father where possible. I accept that her anxiety plays a part in her assessment of whether it is safe for the children to visit Eritrea. Losing A when she was four years old was a tragedy. For the mother as A&#8217;s primary carer I do not underestimate the impact this has on her thinking. However viewed objectively the risks clearly outweigh the benefits at the present time, I do not believe it is appropriate to pre-determine whether the children should visit at any point in the future. If that issue arises it will have to be determined in the Ugandan courts having regard to the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings and the risk balance at that point in time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the provision of the passports to the father I do not accept the father&#8217;s reasons for wishing to have those documents. I think the reality is that the father wishes to have them in order to achieve some sort of parity with the mother; it is a rights issue not a practicalities issue. Within the Schengen area he should be able to travel without restriction and I see no need for him to have the passports for identification reasons. As a Dutch citizen and with this order or a travel consent form he should be to travel freely to Euro-Disney Germany or anywhere else within the Schengen area. Providing him with the passports opens a window to possible action by him which is not child-centred and which could have significant consequences for the children. I do not consider that there is sufficient advantage in him having the passports to take that risk.</p>
