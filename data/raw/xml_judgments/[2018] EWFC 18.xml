	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">The background is as follows. The parties were born and raised in New Zealand.  The husband was born in 1961 and is therefore now aged 57.  The wife was born in 1964 and is therefore now aged 53.  They were married in Wellington, New Zealand on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 1990.  They have three children, all daughters, now aged 25, 22 and 19 respectively.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">The wife is a nurse specialising in caring for patients with infectious diseases.  The husband is an economist and, for much of his working life, was employed by the Asian Development Bank.  Until 1994, he worked in New Zealand, but in that year, he was posted abroad and has not lived or worked in New Zealand since then. Thereafter, he worked in a number of other countries and was accompanied by the family.  Between 1995 and 1999, they lived in England and the youngest child was born here, the older two having been born in New Zealand. A property was purchased in Twickenham in which the family lived.  In 1999, they moved to Sydney, Australia and the Twickenham property was sold and the parties purchased a flat in Knightsbridge as a rental property, subsequently selling it a few years later.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">In 2008, the husband was posted to Manila in the Philippines and, again, the family moved with him.  In 2011, the wife and children returned to New Zealand.  By that point, one of the children had significant health problems and this was one reason for the wife&#8217;s decision to return to New Zealand at that stage. In addition, however, the marriage was in difficulties.  In 2013, the parties instructed lawyers in New Zealand and started negotiations about a divorce and a financial settlement.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">In 2014, the wife, who had started a relationship with another man, moved with the two younger children to live with her new partner in France.  This arrangement was, however, short lived.  The relationship broke down and a few months later that year, the wife and the youngest child moved to Bristol.  At that time, the circumstances of this move were discussed in email exchanges between the wife and husband which demonstrate that they were still on reasonably good terms. The parties agreed on the sale of the former matrimonial home in New Zealand and the investment of funds in a new property for the wife and youngest child in Bristol.</p>

By that point, all three girls were in Europe.  The wife said in her email that she was sorry the girls were over here and he, the husband, over there.  She therefore suggested:</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">The husband had already been thinking about taking this step and in February 2016, he left his employment and moved to England to work for the European Reconstruction and Development Bank, renting a flat in London.  Thereafter, the parties spent time together with the husband visiting Bristol for weekends and the wife and the two younger children visiting his flat in London. The extent to which there was any reconciliation between them is a matter of dispute between the parties which it has not been necessary for this court to resolve for the purposes of this application.</p>

In the petition, she asserted that the courts of England and Wales had jurisdiction by reason of the fact that she had been habitually resident in this jurisdiction for a year prior to the presentation of the petition.  </p>

(2) The parties retained New Zealand lawyers and conducted negotiations prior to the petitioner departing New Zealand to reside in France.

On her case, they lived together from February 2016 until August 2017 shortly before she filed her petition for divorce in this country.  As a result, on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2018, a judge in New Zealand listed a hearing to determine whether or not the dissolution order should remain final.  That hearing was originally listed for 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2018, but the husband has now asked for it to be adjourned.</p>

First, <marker name="tab"/>there have to be proceedings in respect of the marriage that exist in another <marker name="tab"/>jurisdiction, although it does not matter whether they were started before or after <marker name="tab"/>the original proceedings.  Secondly, the balance of fairness (including <marker name="tab"/>convenience) has to be such that it is appropriate for the proceedings in the former <marker name="tab"/>jurisdiction to be first disposed of, which means there must be an assessment by <marker name="tab"/>the English court of that balance.

The husband asserts that he has no permanent right to reside in this country and no intention to stay here in the long term.  His plan is to return to New Zealand where he has retained links and where his siblings, most of his friends and relatives all reside. Although he acknowledges that their children may settle in different parts of the world, he thinks they would regard New Zealand as their home and believes there is a good chance that it will once again become the centre of their family ties.  </p>

He therefore asserts that the original intention was for New Zealand law to apply.  He states that the wife filed her petition in this jurisdiction without any prior notice.  He says he was outraged when he received the petition and believed that his cooperation and acquiescence during the earlier negotiations had been taken advantage of.  He asserts that the wife&#8217;s conduct amounts to forum shopping.  The husband refers to a proposal he has put to the wife that he would have no objections to the divorce proceeding in this country provided that she undertakes not to seek financial relief here and to allow the New Zealand courts to deal with that aspect.  The fact that she had declined his offer reinforces his belief that this has been an exercise in forum shopping. </p>

Resolution of those matters will involve obtaining information from New Zealand, valuation of assets in that country, and consideration of New Zealand trust law.  Furthermore, he has pension assets in New Zealand and elsewhere, but not in England.  He asserts that the English court would have no jurisdiction to make a pension sharing order in this case.  In contrast, the assets held by the parties in this country are, in the husband&#8217;s phrase, entirely uncomplicated, consisting of only bank accounts and the jointly owned property in Bristol. There is nothing of complexity about those assets which would cause problems for a New Zealand court considering the financial remedies&#8217; dispute.</p>

It is her case that she settled here permanently in May 2015.  Later that year, she and the husband agreed to reconcile and he moved to this country as her spouse on her right of abode visa to look for a job close to the family. It is the wife&#8217;s case that, for a time, she and the husband resumed cohabitation.  The family home was purchased in Bristol following the sale of the home in New Zealand.  She now wishes to remain here for the rest of her life and has recently been granted British citizenship to which she was entitled as a result of her mother&#8217;s nationality.</p>

Throughout the marriage, she and the husband lived in eight different cities and, as a result, she feels exhausted.  All her personal possessions are in this country in Bristol.  In the course of the hearing, the husband confirmed that the majority of his personal possessions are also now in this country, either in his flat in London or in storage.</p>

In the intervening 23 years, the husband has not lived there at all, only visiting occasionally.  The wife lived there for two and three quarter years between 2011 and 2014 when she was supporting the parties&#8217; older daughter.  Save for that period, she too has only visited occasionally.  She asserts that, in contrast, in the 23-year period, the family lived in England for a total of seven and a half years.  During the 23 years, the parties owned a house in New Zealand for a period of nine years, eight months and have owned a property in this country for seven years, six months.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">Thirdly, the wife relies on the physical difficulties which would arise were she required to litigate in New Zealand.  Given her limited income as a nurse, she would find it difficult to meet the expenditure involved in travelling to that country, compounded by the fact that the proceedings have been issued in a relatively remote part of the country where her husband was born. The number of hearings which would be required in New Zealand is unclear, depending to some extent on whether there is a contested dissolution hearing.  It is the wife&#8217;s case that, were she and the husband required to attend three hearings in a court in New Zealand, their combined costs for travel and accommodation would exceed &#163;10,000.  Furthermore, she asserts that the total travel time would take four to five days for the return journey.  She says that she is required to give her employer between two and six months&#8217; notice of leave and, therefore, there is the risk of having to take an unauthorised leave of absence to attend the hearing unless she is given plenty of notice by the New Zealand court.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">The wife asserts that these difficulties have been compounded by her health problems.  She states that she is particularly vulnerable to the increased physical toll following her cancer diagnosis.  She says that she is already finding the stress of this litigation extremely difficult to deal with and does not know how she will be able to cope with the long journey and financial burdens.  The medical report exhibited to her statement describes how the combination of the cancer diagnosis and the acrimonious divorce have created a highly stressful situation resulting in her being affected by significant anxiety and low mood. Her GP is concerned about the stability of her mental health were she required to travel to and from New Zealand.  He recommended that this should only be considered once she has been stable in her mental health for at least three months.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">Fourthly, the wife relies on the fact that this court has wider powers to make property adjustment and lump sum orders than are available in the New Zealand court.  I did not have any expert evidence on this issue, but it is the wife&#8217;s assertion that she has been advised that inherited property is not taken into account by the New Zealand court considering an application for financial remedies and that, since the service of her petition, the husband has been disposing of assets into the discretionary trust on the basis that they are inherited assets and, therefore, to be excluded from consideration. The wife also asserts that the New Zealand court will not be able to make any orders in respect of any immovable assets in another jurisdiction so that, if the financial proceedings initially continue in that country, it may still be necessary for her to continue with the application in this country in order to secure an order in respect of the property in Bristol.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">Finally, it is the wife&#8217;s intention to contest the dissolution proceedings in New Zealand on the grounds that the parties were not separated as a matter of fact in the two years prior to the presentation of the husband&#8217;s petition and that the husband is therefore not entitled to the dissolution order he has claimed.  This will, therefore, necessitate an additional hearing in the court in that country.  The husband says this point falls away if the wife accepts his suggestion that the divorce proceed in this country on the basis that the New Zealand courts deal with financial remedies.</p>

I do not propose to dispute my wife&#8217;s statement on that aspect in detail because of the need to keep the statement short and to the point, but my wife&#8217;s allegation is entirely denied by me.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">In his clear and comprehensive submissions, Mr Norman on behalf of the husband reiterates all the points made by the husband in his written statement and advances a number of additional arguments.  He stresses that both parties are domiciled in New Zealand and any connection with this jurisdiction is short-lived.  He draws attention to the fact that the wife&#8217;s move to this country came after another short-lived move to France.  He asserts that she has &#8216;flitted between jurisdictions since leaving New Zealand.&#8217; He reiterates the point that the majority of the parties&#8217; assets remain in New Zealand, including property held within a family trust of which the husband is only one of the trustees.  He submits that, while the court in this jurisdiction can readily make orders in respect of the Bristol property, it is hard to see how it can deal with a complex trust for a foreign property of which the legal ownership is held by more than one party in a way that is both fair and enforceable.  He also reiterates the husband&#8217;s evidence that the parties have been engaged in negotiations for some time in New Zealand and asserts that, in seeking to begin everything again from scratch in a different jurisdiction with different lawyers who are unacquainted with the law of New Zealand, with the possibility of expert evidence being required from that jurisdiction, the wife is causing unnecessary delay and increasing the costs of both parties. He submits that the wife is wrong to assert that the New Zealand court will not take into account the Bristol property.  Although it cannot make orders in respect of that property, the existence of the property can be taken into account when determining what financial remedies should be granted. He asserts that, in the event that the Bristol property is not included in any financial order made by the New Zealand court, it could properly be dealt with through the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/47" uk:canonical="1996 c. 47" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Trustees of Land and Appointments of Trustees Act 1996</ref> or Part III of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref>. In any event, he submits that the assertion that the wife may receive a lesser award in New Zealand than she might receive in this jurisdiction is neither accepted nor a matter which this court can determine in the absence of expert evidence.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">Finally, Mr Norman warns that, if the husband&#8217;s application for a stay is unsuccessful, it does not follow that the proceedings in New Zealand will cease.  He reminds me that the dissolution of financial proceedings are separate in that jurisdiction so that, if a stay is declined, there is still a risk of competing orders being made in two separate jurisdictions, precisely the scenario that the provisions of the 1973 DMPA were intended to avoid.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">In reply, Miss Villarosa, on behalf of the wife, also reiterates many of the points put forward in her client&#8217;s statement, in particular, the fact the wife is now settled in this country, the practical difficulties involved in the litigating in New Zealand, and the additional costs involved in contesting the dissolution proceedings in that country. She further submits that the English family court can deal with all financial issues in one set of proceedings including any application for a property adjustment order in respect of the Bristol house and, also, all matters concerning the assets in New Zealand.  It is not accepted that the circumstances surrounding the New Zealand assets presents significant difficulties to the English court.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">I accept that the parties - certainly the husband and probably the wife - are domiciled in New Zealand; that a proportion of their assets are in that country, although on the husband&#8217;s case, a significant part of his assets have now been placed in a trust for the benefit of the children; and that the parties were engaged in negotiations in New Zealand for a period before coming to Europe and, at one point, seemingly envisaged that their affairs would be resolved in that jurisdiction. I accept that the wife is seeking to have the divorce and financial remedies claim heard in a jurisdiction where she considers she will achieve a more favourable outcome, although it is plain from the terms of the husband&#8217;s offer to agree to be divorced in this jurisdiction on condition that the financial claims are determined by the New Zealand courts that he, too, is seeking an outcome that is advantageous to him. These points, and all the matters put before me by the husband in his evidence and by Mr Norman on his behalf are all matters to be taken into account in support of his application for a stay.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">First, I find that, at the date on which the wife filed her petition, she had plainly settled permanently in this country.  The husband does not challenge her assertion that she has now settled here and wishes to stay here for the rest of her life.  She has family and friends in this country and she wishes to be close to her children, all of whom seem to have decided to make their lives in England or at least in the northern hemisphere.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">Secondly, although there is no evidence that the husband had made any decision to settle permanently in this country, he had plainly moved to this country for an indefinite period.  He had given up his long term employment with the Asian Development Bank, taken a job in England, and agreed to the sale of the parties&#8217; property in New Zealand and the investment of the proceeds of sale of that property towards the purchase of the house in Bristol. In his statement in reply, filed without permission, he denies the wife&#8217;s assertion that they had not separated until very recently.  As I understand his case, however, he does not deny that he came to this country to live near the family and spent time in their company.  In answer to a question from the court, it was confirmed on his behalf that the bulk of his personal belongings had all been moved to this country.  Plainly, at the date the petition was filed, both parties were habitually resident in England and Wales, applying the test identified by the Supreme Court in a series of cases, in particular <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A v A and Another (Children: Habitual Residence) (Reunite International Child Abduction Centre and Others Intervening)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/60" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 60" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 60</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] AC 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] AC 1</ref>, both parties having plainly achieved some degree of integration in a social and family environment in this country. In my judgment, both parties had made their home here, the wife permanently, the husband at least for the time being.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">Thirdly, although New Zealand remained their country of domicile, neither party had spent much time there in the preceding 23 years.  The husband has never lived in that country since 1994 and only visited for a few weeks every year.  The wife lived there for just under three years between 2011 and 2014.  Although the husband retains some assets there, they were, on his own evidence, to a considerable extent, assets he inherited from his own father.  They were assets that originated there as opposed to assets that he had moved there. I accept that, in 2013, the parties started negotiating in New Zealand concerning the terms of a possible settlement, but that was before they moved to this country and became habitually resident here.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">Fourthly, it is to my mind unquestionably an advantage that the English family court will be able to resolve all financial issues between the parties in one set of proceedings.  If the matrimonial finance claim were to proceed in New Zealand, there is a significant likelihood that there would be residual issues which would have to be litigated at additional cost in this country, either under TOLATA or Part III of the MFPA.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">Fifthly, I do not regard the fact that some of the parties&#8217; assets are held in New Zealand as a factor which adds significant weight to the husband&#8217;s argument for a stay.  The English family court is used to dealing, day in, day out, with financial remedies claims involving assets held in foreign countries.  It is not difficult to obtain valuations of such assets, nor, if necessary, advice as to the relevant foreign law including trust law.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.2in">Finally, I accept that the continuation of the proceedings in New Zealand is likely to be burdensome on the wife, particularly given her state of health.  I think it unlikely that she will be content to participate via video link.  As Miss Villarosa indicated in her submissions, the wife would want to be present in court when her claims are resolved. Notwithstanding the husband&#8217;s offer to meet her costs, the travel would not be easy for her, given her current problems.  Thus, in terms of what have been called trial mechanics, the balance of convenience plainly comes down in favour of the proceedings continuing in this jurisdiction.</p>

No application has been made for such an injunction and, as such, it would be wrong for this court to consider making such an order at this stage.  Equally, I do not think it appropriate for this court to make any observation as to the course which the New Zealand court might take.  No doubt, the parties will inform the New Zealand court of the outcome of this application and it is a matter for the New Zealand court to decide what steps to take with regards to the proceedings in that jurisdiction.</p>
