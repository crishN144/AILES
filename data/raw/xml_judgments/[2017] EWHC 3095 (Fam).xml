	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this matter, I am required to determine a dispute between His Royal Highness Louis Xavier Marie Guillaume Prince of Luxembourg, Prince of Nassau and Prince of Bourbon-Parma (whom I shall hereafter refer to as &#8216;the husband&#8217;) and Her Royal Highness Tessy Princess of Luxembourg, Princess of Nassau and Princess of Bourbon-Parma (whom I shall hereafter refer to as &#8216;the wife&#8217;) as to the proper ambit of a reporting restriction order applied for by the husband to regulate the reporting of these financial remedy proceedings.  The Telegraph Media Group Ltd (hereafter &#8216;TMG&#8217;) is a respondent to the application.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the heart of the dispute between the husband and the wife on this issue is the question of the extent to which the wife should be permitted to publish information from these proceedings in an attempt to redress what she submits has been deeply hurtful, tendentious and wholly inaccurate coverage of her within the context these proceedings. The wife asserts that this coverage has brutally, unjustly and unfairly traduced her character and reputation and which she contends has resulted in upsetting and misleading comments &#8220;below the line&#8221; of articles online. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Specifically, whilst agreeing that a reporting restriction order should be made, in pursuit of her aim the wife seeks to make public the bare terms of her open offer to the husband and certain information concerning the former matrimonial home, some of which, the wife submits, is already in the public domain.  By contrast, the husband seeks to frame the terms of the order so as to restrict the media from publishing any information concerning the parties' financial arrangements, which would include the terms of the wife&#8217;s open offer and information concerning the former matrimonial home.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Subject to this dispute as to the proper scope of the order in respect of these matters, both the husband and the wife accept that, considering the extensive publicity that has already accompanied their separation, and their subsequent divorce and financial remedy proceedings, the order should be limited in its ambit to the parties&#8217; financial information and information concerning their children.  TMG contends that the wife should be able to provide, and TMG should be able to publish, the terms of her open offer and the other information in issue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In determining this application, I have had the benefit of written and oral submissions from Mr James Ewins QC and Ms Alexandra Marzec on behalf of the husband, Ms Marzec taking the lead on the submissions with respect to publicity, from Ms Emma Hargreaves and Mr John Stables on behalf of the wife, Mr Stables taking the lead on the issue of publicity and oral submissions from Mr Greg Callus on behalf of TMG.  In light of certain issues that developed during oral argument at the hearing, I gave permission to TMG to file further written submissions and permission to the husband and wife to provide written submissions in reply if so advised.  In the event, both the husband and the wife took the opportunity to respond to the further written submissions of TMG.  In the time it has taken to compile this reserved judgment, the parties also sought to assail the court with communications regarding further press coverage of this matter, accompanied by requests to take various additional matters into account.  For the avoidance of doubt, I make clear that I have determined this application <span style="font-style:italic">solely</span> on the evidence and submissions that were before the court at the hearing, together with the supplementary written submissions for which the court gave permission.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband is the third son of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg.  The wife is also Luxembourgish.  She is not of Royal descent.  The parties commenced their relationship in 2004 whilst the husband was a student and the wife was a non-commissioned officer in the Luxembourg Army.  The parties were married on 29 September 2006.  The parties have two children, aged 10 and 11.  In 2009, the wife was formally recognised as a member of the Royal Family and granted her title by Royal Decree.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During their marriage, the parties lived in the United States before latterly moving to live in London.  The marriage broke down in the summer of 2016 and the wife applied for <span style="font-style:italic">decree nisi </span>in January 2017, which decree was granted on 17 February 2017.  This was widely reported in the media.   This court has made directions for the determination of the financial remedy proceedings between the parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties&#8217; financial position is before the court by way of disclosure provided by each party pursuant to their duty of full and frank disclosure.  The court also has before it certain information provided by third parties relevant to the dispute between the husband and the wife. A summary of the parties&#8217; financial arrangements, in respect of which there remains a significant dispute, will be set out in an annex to this judgment, including the information concerning the former matrimonial home that is in issue at this hearing.  In light of my decision as to the proper ambit of the reporting restriction order, that annex is not included in the published version of this judgment.  What can properly be said however, is that, on each party&#8217;s case at its highest, the assets in dispute are modest by comparison to the majority of financial remedy cases that come before the High Court.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have already noted, the wife has made an open offer of settlement to the husband.  That offer was made on 22 September 2017 and amended on 18 October 2017.  As is good practice, the open offer sets out, from the wife&#8217;s perspective, the detailed financial position and analysis on which the offer is based, drawn from the material disclosed in the proceedings, as well as material provided voluntarily by third parties.  The details of that offer in so far as they are relevant to the issues before the court will also be contained in an annex to this judgment.  Once again, in light of my decision as to the proper ambit of the reporting restriction order, that annex is not included in the published version of this judgment.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have already stated, the separation of the parties and their divorce proceedings had already been the subject of media coverage both in this jurisdiction and in the countries of Europe. Examples of that coverage are contained in the bundle of evidence that is before the court.  It is accepted by the husband that certain aspects of the coverage of the wife have amounted to a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">personal attack</span>&#8221; on her.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One story has been the focus of examination in this context.  Namely, an article in L&#235;tzebuerg Privat, a German language magazine in Luxembourg.  The court has the benefit of a translation of the article.  It is beyond dispute that the article is written in pejorative and tendentious terms.  The central contention of the article is that the wife is, to quote the article in a manner that gives some flavour of its approach, the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">daughter of a roofer and a housewife</span>&#8221; who is now desperate to cling to her Royal title.  The article states in its opening paragraph its author&#8217;s view that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">It is about time that the former soldier is brought back down to earth and is reminded of where she comes from</span>&#8221;.  The article also at one point implies, but does not state in terms, that the wife married the husband for financial reasons.  The article does not, at least in the translation I have available to me, use a term that translates to the English phrase &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">gold digger</span>&#8221;.  The article does however, as I have said, contend that the wife married the husband for reasons of self-aggrandisement and financial gain.  At the first directions hearing on 13 October 2017, the husband made clear through leading counsel that he shared the wife&#8217;s &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">disgust</span>&#8221; with respect to the article in L&#235;tzebuerg Privat.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 13 October 2017, I dealt with the first directions appointment in these proceedings.  At that hearing, accredited members of the press were present in court as they are entitled to be pursuant to FPR r 27.11.  During submissions at the hearing, leading counsel for the wife referred to the story in L&#235;tzebuerg Privat and stated that the wife wished to put the record straight as the article in that publication &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">suggests she is a gold digger and married for title and money</span>&#8221;.   In response, at the end of the hearing leading counsel for the husband made an oral application for a reporting restriction order, contending that the wife&#8217;s submission was evidence that she intended to take the parties&#8217; financial dispute to the media.  The terms of the order applied for by the husband restricted the publication of material that referred to or concerned any of the parties&#8217; financial information, including, but not limited to, that contained in their compulsory written disclosure, replies to questionnaires, solicitors&#8217; correspondence, witness statements, oral evidence or referred to in submissions made on their behalf, save to the extent that such information was already in the public domain.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was extremely conscious that the media were not on formal notice of the husband&#8217;s application, made as it was orally at the end of the hearing on 13 October 2017.  However, in circumstances where any publication of the information in dispute, before the court had had the opportunity to hear full argument and rule on the issue, would have defeated the purpose of the husband&#8217;s application for injunctive relief, and in circumstances where I had had the benefit of brief representations from the journalists from the Press Association and from the Daily Telegraph present in court, I was persuaded to take the <span style="font-style:italic">exceptional</span> course of granting an interim reporting restriction order for the shortest possible period until the matter could return before me on notice to the media.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In circumstances where my interim order was expressly limited to the terms sought by the husband, several articles appeared in the English media following the hearing, based on, and dealing with information already in the public domain.  Some of those articles reported the assertions made by L&#235;tzebuerg Privat that the wife had married into the Luxembourg Royal Family for self-aggrandisement and financial gain.  Several of the headlines accompanying the stories in the English media employed the phrase &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">gold digger</span>&#8221; deployed by leading counsel for the wife at the hearing on 13 October 2017. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, before turning to the parties&#8217; submissions in detail, two points of procedure need to be addressed.  First, on behalf of TMG, Mr Callus complains that the husband required TMG to provide undertakings before he would consent to the wife&#8217;s statement in response to this application to be released to TMG.  Mr Callus points to FPR PD 12I para 3.3, which records that legal advisers to the media can differentiate between information provided for legal purposes and information for editorial use.  Mr Callus is right to emphasise this provision. For reasons which will be self-evident, it is important that media organisations responding to applications for reporting restriction orders are in a position properly to argue their case.  This will ordinarily require those media organisations to be on notice of the evidence relied on in support of the application for such orders.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Second, as I have noted, the husband first made his application for a reporting restriction order orally and without proper notice to the media (or indeed to the wife). This placed the court in the difficult and invidious position at the end of the court day of having to decide between making a draconian order restricting the right to freedom of expression and risking the defeat of the husband&#8217;s application before it could be argued.  FPR PD12I makes clear the steps that <span style="font-style:italic">must</span> be taken to notify the respondents to an application for a reporting restriction order before such an order is made.  If the strict procedural safeguards that rightly attach to applications for reporting restriction orders are to be properly adhered to, it is <span style="font-style:italic">vital </span>that in financial remedy cases where the issue of publicity is likely to arise, consideration is given by parties and legal advisers to this issue in advance of the FDA and a proper on notice application prepared if such an order is to be sought.</p>

Ms Marzec submits that the order sought by the husband does not seek to bind the wife as to what she can say independent of the proceedings.  The husband further makes clear through Ms Marzec that the wife may &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">state publicly and in very general terms that she wants a fair settlement and has made offers to try to achieve this</span>&#8221;.  Ms Marzec points out the description by the wife&#8217;s leading counsel of her open offer at the first directions appointment on 13 October 2017 as being &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a very reasonable and sensible proposal</span>&#8221; has already been reported in the Daily Telegraph.

Within this context, Ms Marzec submits that financial remedy proceedings are shrouded in inherent confidentiality and privacy.  The husband further submits, relying on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allen </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] Fam 261" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] Fam 261</ref>, that it has long been settled law that such financial and other personal information and documentation, when disclosed pursuant to the duty to give full and frank disclosure in financial remedy proceedings, <span style="font-style:italic">must</span> not be reported when referred to at a hearing because of the existence of an implied undertaking.   The husband submits that the common law position articulated by <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allen</span> has survived the amendments to the FPR 2010 which, under FPR r 27.11, permit the attendance at hearings in financial remedy proceedings of duly accredited representatives of news gathering and reporting organisations.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, Ms Marzec nonetheless contends that in this case a reporting restriction order is required in the terms she advances as (a) the boundary between what is protected by the common law on confidentiality as articulated in <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allen</span> and that which can properly be reported is ill-defined; (b) an order is required to prevent the wife from providing private information to the media as a means of exerting pressure on the husband within the context of this litigation, the husband contending that the wife&#8217;s stated wish to disclose her open offer and certain information concerning the former matrimonial home confirms her intentions in this regard; and (c) an order is required to protect information provided in these proceedings voluntarily by third parties, which information the husband submits is arguably not covered by the common law principles with respect to confidentiality.  In her supplementary written submissions on the husband&#8217;s behalf, Ms Marzec points out that in <span style="font-style:italic">Appleton v Gallagher</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] EMLR 3" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EMLR 3</ref> Mostyn J made a reporting restriction order despite concluding that the 2009 changes to the FPR were not intended to abrogate the core privacy provided by the implied undertaking.</p>

In circumstances where the wife states that she fears the children have already become aware of stories about her and that she fears the effect of this, Ms Marzec submits that the wife&#8217;s wish to publish information is inconsistent with the children&#8217;s right to privacy.  Within this context, Ms Marzec points to a public statement issued by the wife in January 2017 in which she referred to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">challenging times</span>&#8221; and asked for privacy and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">especially privacy for our children</span>&#8221;.

Ms Marzec submits that none of the Luxembourgian Royal family hold any official or public position in this jurisdiction nor are they supported by the British taxpayer.

He contends that there can be no implied undertaking towards one&#8217;s own offer, at least when expressed in simple and absolute terms isolated from any financial information of the other party, in contrast, for example, to an offer containing references to, or calculations linked to earnings, investments and the like.  With respect to the information concerning the family home, within the context of the foregoing legal submissions he submits that, likewise, no implied undertaking arises and the wife is free to disseminate that information.</p>

With respect to Art 8, Mr Callus submits that this is not a case where the &#8216;intrusion&#8217; aspect of interference with Art 8 rights is likely to arise as the information in issue is financial in nature, rather than information that concerns, for example, sexual, medical or criminal matters.  Within this context, Mr Callus submits that the publication of the information is not apt to cause embarrassment and/or distress.  Further, Mr Callus submits that whilst financial information is <span style="font-style:italic">capable</span> of engaging the Art 8 rights of the parties, it lacks the character of information relating to the private dignity of the person that might be engaged by information relating to sexual or medical information.

Tugendhat J noted that, in line with the decisions in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Robertson) v Wakefield MDC</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] QB 1052" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] QB 1052</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">(Robertson) v Secretary of State for Home Department </span>[2003] EWHC 1760, there is no doubt that the home address of an individual is information the disclosure and use of which that individual has a right to control in accordance with Art 8.  Within that context, Tugendhat J held that the addresses of the homes in question should be protected from publication on the basis that the information as to the addresses that the claimant sought to protect was not in the public domain to the extent, or in the sense, that re-publication could not have significant effect or that the information was not eligible for protection at all.  Tugendhat J also made clear that the fact that an address in conjunction with other information may be regarded as a &#8220;highly sensitive combination&#8221; will be relevant to the question of whether protection should be afforded by way of injunctive relief, the combination in that case being an individual's address, the fact that the person is a child, and the fact that that child has a troubled history of mental health, sexual life and involvement in the commission of crime.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn next to the implied undertaking.  The effect on the parallel analysis of competing rights of the implied undertaking that is recognised as arising in respect of information disclosed under compulsion in financial remedy proceedings has also been the subject of some debate.  It is well established that the information to which the implied undertaking will apply will be information disclosed into the proceedings under compulsion, or information disclosed voluntarily the disclosure of which would have been compelled but for the co-operation of the party in question (<span style="font-style:italic">Bourns Inc v Raychem Corpn</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 3 All ER 154" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 3 All ER 154</ref> at 162 and <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allan</span> at [62]).  As noted in <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allan</span>, in financial remedy cases the requirement of full and frank disclosure places a considerable degree of compulsion upon both parties.  Within this context, in <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allan </span>at [73], Butler-Sloss P made clear that information disclosed voluntarily as a requirement of full and frank disclosure will be protected by the implied undertaking.</p>

Further, it is clear from <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allen</span>, that the operation of the implied undertakings does not preclude the need to undertake a balancing of the competing rights engaged where there is an issue over whether the information to which the implied undertaken applies should be published (see <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allan </span>at [82] and see <span style="font-style:italic">Lykiardopulo v Lykiardopulo</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 FLR 1439" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 FLR 1439</ref>).  Within this context, the operation of the implied undertaking will not of itself constitute a disproportionate interference in Art 10 (see <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allan</span> at [82]).  Rather, the fact of the implied undertaking, existing as it does to protect the proper administration of justice from the consequences of publication of information that might otherwise undermine that proper administration, is simply a factor to be weighed when determining where the balance lies.</p>

It is the protection provided by the court in cases of compulsion. Ancillary relief applications are appropriately heard in private in accordance with the 1991 Rules, see above. The public may not, without leave of the court, hear the evidence given in these applications. It would make a nonsense of the use of an implied undertaking if information about the means of a party, in some cases sensitive information, could be made public as soon as the substantive hearing commenced. Information disclosed under the compulsion of ancillary relief proceedings is, in my judgment, protected by the implied undertaking, before, during and after the proceedings are completed.&#8221;</p>

In the context of an application to restrict the publication of information not yet in the possession of the media, it is, in any event, a rather arid question in this case.  If the media already had in its possession the information in issue in this case, then the question of the extent that the media was itself bound by the implied undertaking might be of greater relevance to the balancing exercise. That however, is not the position here.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that it is not necessary to determine the question in this case.  I note in passing that the authorities have repeatedly suggested that, in circumstances where the purpose of the implied undertaking is to protect the administration of justice, the implied obligation not to make improper use of discovered documents is independent of any obligation existing under the general law relating to confidentiality, is owed not to the owner of the documents but to the court and is enforceable by the court (see <span style="font-style:italic">Home Office v Harman</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1983] 1 AC 280" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1983">[1983] 1 AC 280</ref> at 308 and see <span style="font-style:italic">Riddick v Thames Board Mills Ltd </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1977] QB 881" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1977">[1977] QB 881</ref> at 896 and <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allan </span>at [105]-[106]).  </p>

Accordingly, such information is amenable to restrictions on publication depending on the outcome of a balancing exercise involving any competing rights.   In my judgment, the same analysis applies to the information concerning the family home.  In so far as that information does not engage the implied undertaking and/or is already in the public domain, it nonetheless engages the parties&#8217; rights under Art 8.  In circumstances where the former matrimonial home is their home, it will also engage the children&#8217;s Art 8 rights to respect for private life. </p>

Whilst members of the Luxembourg Royal Family, the husband and the wife have no official public role in Luxembourg, much less in this jurisdiction.  Within this context, they are private individuals rather than public servants or individuals with a public role in this or another jurisdiction.  Further, whilst their separation and the fact of their financial remedy proceedings has been made public, this is not a case in which either the husband or the wife has sought, thus far, to litigate the details of their personal or financial disagreements in public.  Indeed, the wife has expressly called for the media to respect the family&#8217;s privacy for the sake of the children. </p>

Whilst I accept that FPR r 27.10 allows the court to decide to hear the proceedings in public, it is plain on the face of FPR r 27.10 that the starting point is that such proceedings <span style="font-style:italic">will </span>be heard in private.  This position is readily understandable in circumstances where the court is dealing with the facts and documents relating to the parties&#8217; personal financial affairs.  Within this context, unless the court has exercised its discretion under r 27.10(1)(b), any media in attendance pursuant to FPR r 27.11 will be attending a private hearing, as FPR r 27.11(1) expressly recognises. </p>

Negotiations in proceedings of this nature are, by their nature, sensitive and complex.  It is important that they can take place without undue pressure being brought to bear by one or other party and in circumstances where external influences that could disrupt or derail the delicate process of compromise are avoided.   In this regard, I note again that Parliament has expressly provided in FPR r 27.11(1)(a) for the media to be excluded from hearings conducted for the purpose of judicially assisted conciliation or negotiation.  Once again, as Holman J noted in <span style="font-style:italic">Fields v Fields </span>at [5], such hearings are &#8220;totally private and totally privileged&#8221;.

The ambit of the private life of the children is a wide one, encompassing not only the narrow concept of personal freedom from intrusion but also psychological and physical integrity, personal development and the development of social relationships and physical and social identity (see <span style="font-style:italic">Botta v Italy </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1998) 26 EHRR 241" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">(1998) 26 EHRR 241</ref> at [32] and <span style="font-style:italic">Bensaid v United Kingdom</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2001) 33 EHRR 205" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">(2001) 33 EHRR 205</ref> at [46] and [47]).  Within this context, it is self-evidently important that, in the context of marital breakdown, the stability of the children&#8217;s circumstances should be preserved to the greatest extent possible.  As recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">K v L</span>, this will extend to ensuring that the children are not adversely affected by publicity surrounding the breakdown and re-constitution of their family life.

It is also important to note when undertaking that balance, that an order preventing the wife from publishing the bare terms of her open offer and the information concerning the matrimonial home will not prevent the wife from speaking out in general terms about what she contends is the woeful mischaracterisation of her and of her motives in some parts of the media, as indeed she has done.  </p>

Having regard to the &#8216;Public Interest&#8217; section of the IPSO Code, and accepting the list therein is not exhaustive, I struggle to see how the status of the parties engages the public interest in this case.

For that to arise something more than disobedience of the court's direction needs to be established.

Without the order I intend to make, I am satisfied that, as Ms Marzec submits, in response to the publication of the bare terms of the wife&#8217;s open offer, the husband will be compelled to indicate publicly his position, not least because by virtue of his Royal status his personal wealth will likely be assumed, wrongly, to be vast.  I am satisfied that I can take judicial notice of the fact that, thereafter, extensive comment in the media is likely, quite lawfully, to follow. This risks external pressure being brought to bear on one or both parties with respect to their negotiating positions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is undesirable to say the least to have negotiations in financial remedy cases proceed in the glare of publicity, influenced by the public&#8217;s view of what is and is not a fair offer, with the possibility of parties crafting offers with an eye to how they might play to the public and one or other party being placed under pressure to settle by public opinion.  The process of negotiation becomes much more difficult where both parties fear that their offers and concessions &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">will be laundered in the media</span>&#8221;, to use Ms Marzec&#8217;s phrase.  Such a position would also risk giving rise to satellite litigation in respect of the publication of offers concerning, for example, what information in an offer is or is not protected by the implied undertaking. It is particularly undesirable that all this may be the case where Parliament and the courts have expressly recognised the confidentiality of negotiations in the context of financial remedy proceedings.  </p>

In the circumstances, the order I make does not constitute any sort of blanket prohibition on the wife addressing these matters. Further, I am satisfied that the terms of the order I make should, initially, last only until the conclusion of the proceedings. In circumstances where the justification for the order is to protect the administration of justice by permitting the parties to negotiate in conditions of confidentiality, it may be that, at the conclusion of the proceedings, the application of the balancing exercise will produce a different result.  Accordingly, the order I make will be subject to review at the conclusion of the proceedings.  </p>

Thus, the media will be able to publish information already in the public domain save where that information is prohibited from publication by the order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The publication of gossip is not a new phenomenon.  Over one hundred years ago, in their seminal article entitled &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">The Right to Privacy</span>&#8221; (4 Harvard L.R. 193 December 15, 1890), Louis Brandies and Samuel Warren deprecated gossip in columns of the daily papers that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">belittles by inverting the relative importance of things, thus dwarfing the thoughts and aspirations of a people</span>&#8221; and that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">crowds the space available for matters of real interest to the community</span>&#8221;.  The rise of the Internet and social media adds a further dimension to the milieu of gossip once traditionally the purview of the print media.  Constituencies coalesce on social media and &#8216;below the line&#8217; in respect of stories that appear online, which constituencies consider themselves entitled to pass definitive, and frequently caustic judgment on people they have never met and about whose true character and circumstances they know very little, often coming ultimately to concrete and seemingly immovable conclusions based on little more than assumption and speculation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a legitimate function of the right to freedom of expression and, subject to the limits set by the criminal law and the law of libel, all perfectly lawful.  However, it is difficult not to have a degree of sympathy for the wife given the manner in which she has been traduced by some sections of the media abroad and the comments and speculation she has had to endure from others as a result.  Her desire to seek to set the record straight is understandable.  Be that as it may, in ensuring the proper administration of justice in financial remedy proceedings, it is vital that the court safeguards the integrity and efficacy of all aspects of its own proceedings.  For the reasons I have given, to publish the bare terms of the wife&#8217;s open offer and the information concerning the family home will, in my judgment, act to undermine the administration of a crucial process the court is required to oversee in order to do justice between the parties. </p>

Having regard to the balance between the respective rights engaged, I am satisfied that to do so is proportionate to the necessity in a democratic society of protecting the administration of justice by ensuring that parties to financial remedy proceedings can negotiate in conditions of confidentiality with a view to resolving their disputes. Within this context, I make an order in the terms of the draft order set out in the Schedule to this judgment.  </p>
