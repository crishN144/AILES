Following the judgement the local authority has highlighted the issue to staff and continues to ensure that Emergency Protection Orders are only sought in appropriate circumstances. However, the local authority maintains the view that it did not act inappropriately in seeking an Emergency Protection Order in the case in point.</p>

Of note in this particular case the names of the solicitors are contained in the judgement. As they are all based in the Fylde Coast and Blackpool is the only Borough Council in that area that deals with Children Act proceedings anyone so wishing could discern the identity of the local authority and it is accepted therefore that we could not resist the lifting of the anonymity of the local authority on this basis alone.</p>

		  <num>1.</num>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">The local authority was granted anonymity due to the unusual circumstances of the case. The court will recall that this was a case where the local authority took the most exceptional step of asking the court not to make any findings in respect of the Threshold Criteria as it believed this course of action to be in the best interests of the children. The court therefore heard no evidence and there was no factual determination of any of the matters leading to the proceedings. The full details of the case are accordingly not reported in the judgement.</p>

		  <num>3.</num>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">It is not clear why Mrs [B] is seeking to have the anonymity of the local authority lifted at this time. It is approaching 3 years since the Judgement was made. The purpose of the request is given only as to obtain justice, publicise the local authority as abusers and to name and shame the local authority. The local authority is concerned how Mr and Mrs [B] may use the judgement if anonymity is lifted &#8230; I am concerned that it may be the intention of Mr and Mrs [B] to castigate particular individuals involved in the case who may be personally placed at risk by this and who have no opportunity to put forward the local authority&#8217;s position in respect of the case.</p>

I do not know if His Lordship has sought the views of the other parties in the case but details can be provided if they would be of assistance.</p>

The only anonymity which was granted was that deriving from the rubric on the front sheet of my judgment which I have set out in paragraph [1] above. And I have to say that my recollection (which may be wrong) is that this wording was used not as a result of any specific request made by any of the parties but simply because it was the wording conventionally attached at that time to Family Division judgments authorised to be released for publication or report.

He says that there is no public interest in naming the local authority. That may or may not be so, but it is, I think, largely beside the point. It is for the local authority to establish a convincing case for an injunction to restrain the media publishing something which is prohibited neither by the general law nor by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 12</ref> [of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref>]. It cannot establish such a case merely by demonstrating &#8211; even assuming it can &#8211; that there is no public interest in the identity of the local authority, for that is to put the boot on the wrong foot. His real case is that the local authority&#8217;s identity needs to be protected in order to ensure that B&#8217;s identity is protected. That argument, if it could be justified on the facts, might well weigh heavily in the balance. But, in my judgment, Mr Howard fails to make good the factual premise. I do not accept his argument that identification of the local authority is likely to lead to the identification of either B or her carers. I do not accept his argument that a combination of the disclosure sought and &#8220;tittle-tattle&#8221; will serve to identify B.&#8221;</p>

More importantly, however, I cannot see that there is any need to preserve the local authority&#8217;s anonymity in order to protect the children&#8217;s privacy and identities. Disclosure of the name of the local authority is not of itself going to lead to the identification of the children.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I can understand the local authority&#8217;s concern that if anonymity is lifted the local authority (or its employees) may be exposed to ill-informed criticism based, it may be, on misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the facts. But if such criticism exceeds what is lawful there are other remedies available to the local authority. The fear of such criticism, however justified that fear may be, and however unjustified the criticism, is not of itself a justification for affording a local authority anonymity. On the contrary, the powers exercisable by local authorities under Parts IV and V of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> are potentially so drastic in their possible consequences that there is a powerful public interest in those who exercise such powers being publicly identified so that they can be held publicly accountable. The arguments in favour of publicity &#8211; in favour of openness, public scrutiny and public accountability &#8211; are particularly compelling in the context of public law care proceedings: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re X, Barnet LBC v Y and X </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 FLR 998" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 FLR 998</ref> at para [166]. </p>

This is particularly so where, as in the present case, a public authority has been exposed to criticism. I accept, as the local authority correctly points out, that many &#8211; indeed most &#8211; of the matters in dispute in this case were never the subject of any final judicial determination, but the fact remains that in certain respects I was, as my judgment shows, critical of the local authority.

But too often this experience goes either unremarked or recorded in judgments where the local authority is not named. If local authorities which merit criticism are to be named then so too surely should those which deserve praise. If the public interest is a reason for naming the incompetent then surely the very same public interest requires the naming of the competent. Otherwise the public may have a seriously distorted impression of the family justice system &#8211; and that is very certainly <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>in the public interest.</p>
