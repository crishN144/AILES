At the end of that hearing I gave an oral judgment, after which both parties invited me to make a costs order against the other. Since the hearing had already run over its two-hour slot, I asked the two barristers to email me short written reasons in support of their position. I now set out my decision and the reasons for it.</p>

He also receives bonuses by way of cash and shares. Not all the shares are immediately accessible to him, but when they become so they vest at the same time of year as his bonus is paid, which is February. Last year his cash bonus and vesting shares together added a further &#163;175,000 net to his income.</p>

The husband had already agreed to pay the additional &#163;87.50.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my experience of applications like this one, where a large part of the payer&#8217;s income is received annually as a bonus, applicants often seek well over half the respondent&#8217;s monthly salary. When they do, they invariably point to the respondent&#8217;s annual earnings and to the lifestyle they perceive the respondent to be living. In doing so, what often gets overlooked is the cash flow deficit that their proposal creates in the family finances. Too often, applicants fail to recognise that if they get what they ask for the family will run out of money long before the next bonus is paid.</p>

It is hoped that this can be concluded over the summer and will release &#163;70-80,000 before tax. The sale is not guaranteed, however, and I did not consider it appropriate for the court to gamble this family&#8217;s financial security on it completing as anticipated.</p>

As such, the wife&#8217;s fears that he might in future take further steps, such as withholding or threatening to withhold funds to punish her behaviour, were not without foundation. I ordered that he should pay the &#163;7,700 monthly rent and utilities payment to the wife as maintenance on the condition that she would then be responsible for paying it on to the landlord.</p>

More than that, he made an open offer of &#163;6,000 the day after the application was filed which, in hindsight, the wife clearly should have accepted (he even later increased that offer in the hope of avoiding a hearing). In respect of the other limbs of the application, he says that the total amount to be paid was entirely agreed ahead of the hearing, and that the requests to change the structure of how that was to be paid were a late addition introduced by Mr Tambling to give a veneer of legitimacy to an otherwise doomed application.</p>

While he did make various offers regarding funds for a holiday, there was no suggestion at any stage that he would countenance any change to the new separate accounts regime that he had imposed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Instead, the letters set out to justify why the husband decided to separate out the finances in the way that he did. I accept that the reasons given are not without merit. What is objectionable, however, is the way that he imposed those changes, without warning and without agreement. This is a case where both parties have lawyers who have been in almost continuous communication for many months. The parties had even been at court a week previously for the First Appointment and the issue was not raised. It was a controlling action undertaken because, it appears to me, the husband had concluded that only he could be trusted to manage the family finances responsibly. He must have anticipated it would outrage the wife, and to some extent he has brought upon himself what has followed.</p>

Its effect was to distract attention from her core complaint and make it harder for the parties to agree a way forward. She was clearly wrong to pursue this point all the way to a hearing, particularly given the offers made by the husband along the way.</p>

In little over a month the wife has spent nearly &#163;27,000 in bringing the application and the husband nearly &#163;12,000 in defending it. That could have paid for the disputed holiday nearly twice over or, as the husband points out, met a term&#8217;s school fees.</p>

The wife has paid an awful lot of money for what may amount to no more than a little peace of mind.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Looking at the broader context, this couple have now spent between them over &#163;130,000 and are barely past the First Appointment. The wife&#8217;s legal fees in this application, as in the proceedings as a whole, are more than double those of the husband&#8217;s. It is not immediately obvious to me why that should be and suggests a difficulty in approaching the case in a pragmatic and proportionate way. The parties should not need reminding that their resources are finite, and that every pound they spend fighting each other is a pound that will no longer be available for them and their children.</p>

Overall, I struggle to find either of them significantly more culpable than the other such that it would be just to impose a costs order one way rather than the other.</p>
