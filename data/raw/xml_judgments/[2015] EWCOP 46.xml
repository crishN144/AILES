She had been at home for only a few days when suddenly, on 15 January 1997, her condition deteriorated. She had respiratory problems and became extremely pale. Her mother took her to their GP, who told her not to worry and to take her home. Soon afterwards A stopped breathing entirely and had to be rushed into hospital. She suffered an anoxic brain injury, as a result of which she has cerebral palsy, epilepsy, cortical blindness, severe intellectual impairment and extreme behavioural problems with a tendency to be aggressive and violent.</span></p>

He became a partner two years later, and dealt with personal injury litigation as well as acting as a receiver, and later as a deputy, for mentally incapacitated clients. In 2009 he became a consultant with the firm so that he could concentrate on and develop the deputyship side of the practice.

As a result, B&#8217;s physical and emotional needs tended to take a backseat. Members of staff at his primary school were aware of the family&#8217;s circumstances, and were as supportive as they could be. However, B&#8217;s performance dipped noticeably during the build-up to the liability trial in the High Court. In a letter dated 27 March 2011 his head teacher wrote this:</span></p>

With the benefit of hindsight this was almost certainly due, in part, to the distress the family were suffering caring for his severely disabled sister. In year five the family circumstances changed; B was subsequently a lot more relaxed and was able to receive a lot more attention from his parents. As a result he has flourished and we can now see his potential to achieve is high.&#8221;</span></p>

Many families would, in my view, have buckled under the very extreme pressure placed on them by a child with A&#8217;s level of needs, but F and M have, in my opinion, managed admirably in keeping the family together and ensuring that A is treated as part of a cohesive and loving family. I believe that F and M have coped with a fraught and protracted litigation process and have raised two other well-adjusted and achieving children within a caring and &#8216;normal&#8217; loving family environment. I believe that this is impressive and I have approached best interests decision-making on the basis that it is in A&#8217;s best interests for her to remain a core part of the family unit and for the family to be supported so that A remains at the core.</span></p>

I appreciate that some of these requests may seem unusual or idiosyncratic. All families have their idiosyncracies. However, at all times I have had in mind that the alternative to A living at [the family home] and being cared for by her parents would be for her to live in other accommodation with an external care package. Both of these would be considerably more expensive than the solutions I have supported and would tie up A&#8217;s capital, reducing her scope to draw income. And, not least of all, I believe these would be detrimental to her care and welfare and best interests in comparison with the care and support and accommodation that she currently receives.&#8221;</span></p>

Were B to leave XYZ School I fear that he would find it difficult to settle in his new school and that the educational progress that he has made in the last couple of years would be threatened. My fear is that this would disrupt and threaten the whole family and would make the task of caring for A more difficult. At the most basic level, I do not know which school would take B and how the transport arrangements would affect our ability to care for A. I also believe that my husband and I would have to give far more support to B and this would inevitably draw us away from caring for A.&#8221;</span></p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;In the view of the Official Solicitor, the arguments in favour of approving the payments of school fees which have already been made, and those in favour of permitting further payments to be made, are weak.  There is and can be no &#8216;moral obligation&#8217; on A to pay B&#8217;s school fees, since A has never assumed responsibility to do so and she has not been responsible for causing him harm for which she could be said to owe a moral obligation to make compensation. None of the supposed benefits to A to making the payments (that A &#8216;would want&#8217; to make them, for example, or that A would want to make sure that B &#8216;did not resent her&#8217; for not making them) are in fact substantial. The disadvantages to her are, however, real and serious. She will lose (a substantial sum) from her personal injury fund, a fund which was designed to last her for her entire lifetime and which is already much smaller than it should be because of the compromise of the claim in the Court of Appeal. When the investment growth which would otherwise have accrued on those funds is taken into account, the impact on the fund becomes even more severe. &#8230; A&#8217;s fund already supports her family financially, and, in the Official Solicitor&#8217;s view, there is force in the argument that A is still paying for aspects of the family&#8217;s expenditure which she should not be paying for, despite the fact that the deputy was evidently aware of that risk when agreeing to make greater contributions to the family&#8217;s expenditure in June 2014. </span></p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In the Official Solicitor&#8217;s view, the magnetic factor in this case is that A&#8217;s fund is a lump sum personal injury fund, that A has a long life expectancy and very substantial future care needs, and that it is therefore essential that when (as now) she does not require all of her income, her money is carefully invested to provide funds in the future when she is likely to need them. &#8230;</span></p>

The Official Solicitor fully understands that, if B has to leave XYZ School now, that may be difficult for him. This application, however, is not about B&#8217;s interests: it is about A&#8217;s interests and a decision which was originally a misapplication of A&#8217;s funds should not be allowed to continue to prejudice A for years to come because reversing it will affect the rest of her family.</span></p>

In the view of the Official Solicitor, the appropriate course would therefore be for the deputy to reconstitute A&#8217;s fund immediately, with the option to pursue recovery of that sum from F and M, but only at such rate as they are able to afford without affecting the interests of A herself.&#8221;</span></p>

The actual wishes of P can be a relevant factor: section 4(6)(a) says so. The beliefs and values which would be likely to influence P&#8217;s decision, if he had capacity to make the relevant decision, are a relevant factor: section 4(6)(b) says so. The other factors which P would be likely to consider, if he had the capacity to consider them, are a relevant factor: section 4(6)(c) says so. Accordingly, the balance sheet of factors which P would draw up, if he had capacity to make the decision, is a relevant factor for the court&#8217;s decision. Further, in most cases the court will be able to determine what decision it is likely that P would have made, if he had capacity. In such a case, in my judgment, P&#8217;s balance sheet of factors and P&#8217;s likely decision can be taken into account by the court. This involves an element of substituted judgment being taken into account, together with anything else that is relevant. However, it is absolutely clear that the ultimate test for the court is the test of best interests and not the test of substituted judgment. Nonetheless, the substituted judgment can be relevant and is not excluded from consideration. As Hoffmann LJ said in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Bland </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">case, the substituted judgment can be subsumed within the concept of best interests.

The actual wishes of P, which are altruistic and not in any way directly or indirectly self-interested, can be a relevant factor. Further, the wishes which P would have formed, if P had capacity, which may be altruistic wishes, can be a relevant factor. It is not necessary to establish that P would have been aware of the fact that P&#8217;s wishes were carried into effect. Respect for P&#8217;s wishes, actual or putative, can be a relevant factor even where P has no awareness of, and no reaction to, the fact that such wishes are being respected.&#8221;</span></p>

It seeks to support them so far as possible and practicable and in the best interests of the person concerned, and it does so in a variety of ways. However, it is not the function of the court to anticipate, ring-fence or maximise any potential inheritance for the benefit of family members on the death of a protected party, because this is not the purpose for which the compensation for personal injury was intended. The position would be different, of course, if the individual concerned had substantial funds surplus to his requirements that were derived from another source, such as an inheritance or a lottery win. &#8230;</span></p>

AK, who was 11 when the application was made, had cerebral palsy as a result of clinical negligence at the time of his birth. He had been awarded a lump sum of &#163;1,050,000 together with periodical payments at rates gradually increasing from &#163;140,000 to &#163;200,000 a year. His anticipated life expectancy was to age 15. The applicant, who was his professional deputy, applied for an order authorising her to make a gift of &#163;150,000 to A&#8217;s parents to enable them to purchase a plot of land and build a suitably adapted property in Pakistan. The family was of Pakistani ethnic origin and it was beneficial to AK&#8217;s health to spend several months a year there. The application was approved, but proceeded on the basis of an interest free loan to his parents of &#163;150,000 repayable over a period of ten years, and the deputy was authorised to make annual gifts of &#163;15,000 a year to the parents from AK&#8217;s surplus income deriving from the periodical payments.</span></p>

His proposed solution to this problem was crudely opportunistic. He contended that the deputy had behaved in a way that had contravened the authority conferred on him by the court and was not in A&#8217;s best interests and that, accordingly, the deputy was personally liable to reimburse A&#8217;s funds with the amount he had spent on B&#8217;s school fees so far.</span></p>
