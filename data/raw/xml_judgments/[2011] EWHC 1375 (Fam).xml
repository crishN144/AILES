He presently has the lead part in a musical which is at the moment popular and successful. The run, and his part in it, has been extended.

		</authorialNote>, subject to a mortgage of &#163;183,500.  He then spent &#163;140,000 renovating and outfitting it. So at the time when the parties commenced cohabitation PL had actually put into the property around &#163;241,500, or perhaps a little more, since he may have paid off some capital included in the mortgage instalments, and I presume that he had paid purchase costs on top of the  purchase price. </p>

Seven months later in February 1997 DG moved in to live with PL at the London flat and the property in Victoria Park was let. In these proceedings PL says that he obtained a valuation of the London flat of &#163;650,000 in April 1997. I will deal with this assertion later in the judgment. </p>

PL contributed a cash sum of &#163;34,000 and DG provided a further &#163;60,000 by way of mortgage in his sole name.  Their contributions (including the mortgage) were: DG 79%, PL, 21%. DG says that he did a lot of physical work on the property including on the garden. His acting work was sporadic at the time. Before he met PL he would work in telephone sales between engagements. Once he was living with PL he worked on the house and garden and PL contributed to his outgoings as and when needed. </p>

The totality of the net proceeds of sale of the Nutbourne cottage, about &#163;230,000, was put in. DG&#8217;s mortgage loan of &#163;60,000 was rolled over into the purchase price, and the remainder, &#163;330,000, came from PL.  The parties entered into a Deed of Trust in which their interests in the property were specified at 38% to DG and 62% to PL. Those proportions were arrived at on the basis that DG had put in his share of the proceeds of sale of the Nutbourne cottage plus the mortgage of &#163;60,000, and PL had put in his share of the proceeds of sale of OSH, plus &#163;330,000. </p>

Neither party was a wholly satisfactory witness. I thought that PL in particular had substantially rewritten history in his own mind about the financial and social arrangements between the couple in happier times. It is possible on both sides that conversations have taken on unjustified connotations in the process of recall. There is considerable scope for re-interpretation and misinterpretation: this is particularly so in PL&#8217;s case. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">It is conceded on behalf of DG that some adjustment needs to be made for the fact that PL brought into the partnership (i) a property with significant equity (ii) a pension. On the evidence before me it has proved difficult to assess the value of those assets at the date when the parties started to cohabit. Save for minor areas, the parties agree as to the present value of the various assets. Otherwise DG says that this is a case for sharing of all assets and suggests that the overall figure should be 45% of the whole. The Court must also look at need: in this case for housing, and for income, particularly in retirement, as a cross check. </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;This is simply to recognise that in a matrimonial property regime which still starts with the premise of separate property, there is still some scope for one party to acquire and retain separate property which is not automatically to be shared equally between them. The nature and the source of the property and the way the couple have run their lives may be taken into account in deciding how it should be shared. There may be other examples. Take, for example, a genuine dual career family where each party has worked throughout the marriage and certain assets have been pooled for the benefit of the family but others have not. There may be no relationship-generated needs or other disadvantages for which compensation is warranted. We can assume that the family assets, in the sense discussed earlier should be divided equally. But it might well be fair to leave undisturbed whatever additional surplus each has accumulated during his or her working life. However, one should be careful not to take this approach too far. What seems fair and sensible at the outset of a relationship may seem much less fair and sensible when it ends. And there could well be a sense of injustice if a dual career spouse who had worked outside as well as inside the home throughout the marriage ended up less well off than one who had only or mainly worked inside the home.&#8221;</p>

Although obiter, it clearly commands great respect. It relates to the 'dual career'. The suggestion was that, where both parties had worked throughout the marriage, had pooled some of the assets built up by their efforts but had chosen to keep other such assets under their separate control, the latter, although unequal in amount, were unilateral assets which might not be subject to the sharing principle. Because of the convincing logical objections of Lord Nicholls to the different treatment of unilateral assets, we would prefer, so far as it is proper for us to do so, to keep the room for application of the concept closely confined. Lord Mance offered, at [170], the following interesting rationalisation for the suggested extension:</p>

Prior to reading K v L I had already come to the conclusion that treatment of a property as a family home will usually bring it within the concept of matrimonial property at least in a medium term partnership. Mingling/merger must apply particularly to a shared home.

However he also accepted that he had tried to sell the London flat a few years before but had not received an offer. He had been to see 3 or 4 other properties with DG, and one without him. They were all in the West End. So although I accept that he has an emotional attachment to the property that does not exclude its sale. In any event he has a large mortgage facility on it. </p>

Contrary to his written evidence, DG accepted in oral evidence that he had not been persuaded to do so by PL. The Deed of Trust provides that DG is to hold the Amberley cottage on trust for himself and PL as to 62 percent to PL and 38 percent to DG subject to their primary intention to occupy the property as accommodation for themselves; and that each shall pay 50% of the outgoings and in addition DG &#8220;shall contribute 50% and PL shall contribute 50% of such improvements and additions to the property as the parties shall first have mutually have agreed upon (both as to extent and costs) or as shall be reasonably necessary to facilitate the use of the Property for the purposes intended&#8221;.

But he also said that he construed the trust deed as meaning that the equitable interest would be varied to reflect his contribution: Mr. Chamberlayne submitted that it was to be construed as creating a debt to be repaid on sale. The deed does not provide for either construction. PL never asked for any contribution from DG to the payments for the works. I do not need to decide this point, but I am not sure as a strict matter of construction who is right.

The parties subsequently entered into the Civil Partnership without negotiating any pre-partnership agreement and neither asserts that they discussed the effect, if any, of the Civil Partnership on the Deed of Trust, although each says that they talked about financial arrangements generally, and in particular DG&#8217;s relative financial vulnerability, on many occasions throughout their relationship.</p>

DG did not agree these precise figures but agrees that towards the end of the relationship he spent most of his time at the Amberley cottage in order to finish work on the house and to perfect the garden which was to be entered in a competition. He says that the parties&#8217; lives were not separated, in spite of the fact that he spent weekdays at the Amberley cottage: that was just the way in which they ordered their lives.

It seems to me that in those circumstances there was no real expectation of repayment and that what was expressed as a loan in reality drifted into being a gift.  PL gave DG other cash by way of gift: for instance for some expensive dentistry work. PL paid for two major holidays and a number of shorter breaks per year, opera tickets, dining out and other entertainment, for most of the upkeep of the properties, and for all the incidences of an affluent urban and rural lifestyle.  </p>

PL was very anxious on a number of fronts to play up his contribution and to down play DG&#8217;s. However Mr. Bishop&#8217;s opening note states only that the figure should be treated with &#8220;caution&#8221;, the request for the valuation exercise to be carried out was made fairly shortly before trial and was not pressed at trial. Had the parties agreed to seek an opinion as to valuation either at that point or subsequently I would have permitted them to do so but PL remains adamantly opposed to such a valuation, and I was concerned by the statement of intention in Mr Chamberlayne&#8217;s note to me that, were the valuation contrary to his client&#8217;s case, he would seek to cross examine and perhaps seek a second opinion. Whether I ultimately rejected any application or not more time and money would have been expended dealing with an oral application or applications since I doubt that it would have been right to deal with a contested application on paper. Furthermore the payment off of the mortgage, at a time when the value of the property is not known, makes it extremely difficult to ascertain the proportion of the equity which it now represents, and ruled out an arithmetical approach. I therefore decided not convene a hearing, but notified the parties that I was not going to order the exercise to be carried out and would give reasons in this judgment. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">There is no evidence here to support the conclusion that each of these parties had chosen by mutual agreement to lead autonomous economic lives and to keep assets separate. PL&#8217;s case now is plainly based on what he wishes had been the case rather then the actuality. The Deed of Trust, created at a time when it was not even possible for the parties to enter into a civil partnership, and when indeed civil partnerships were not even contemplated, does not lead to the conclusion that this couple intended to separate their affairs. PL says that for these purposes the Amberley cottage is to be treated as the partnership home and that that is the only property which is subject to the sharing principle. Yet at the same time he states that the parties should be regarded as bound by the Deed of Trust and that DG&#8217;s interest in that property must be determined by it. I do not accept that analysis. If the Amberley cottage is to be regarded as the or a partnership home and subject to the sharing principle then the Deed of Trust is irrelevant, and I find that the parties treated it as irrelevant. Neither party relies on the deed of trust per se. Mr Chamberlayne describes it as a &#8220;symptom&#8221; of the asserted separation of and demonstrates an &#8220;attitude&#8221; to their financial affairs and a recognition that they were to share only the Amberley cottage.  I cannot draw any such conclusion: the Deed of Trust antedated the Civil Partnership by many years and was entered into before the status of civil partnership was even contemplated: it has been overtaken by the celebration of the partnership and not acted on or relied on by the parties during their intervening years.   </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">I reject Mr Chamberlayne&#8217;s submission that there is a &#8220;special category&#8221; of dual career childless partnerships/marriages where the sharing principle does not apply. This has the potential to discriminate against the less wealthy partner, and may have a particularly discriminatory impact in civil partnership cases, where &#8220;traditional&#8221; gender roles will not be assumed. That the marriage /partnership is childless may have an impact on need and the assessment of future contribution: it does not affect the sharing principle. The court needs to look at the individual circumstances and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> criteria in each case. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">The parties lived in and treated the homes as theirs during a partnership of some length. Whatever PL may say about his views about the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">ownership</span> of the London flat, it was the home where both lived, and at the beginning of the partnership it was their only home: and it was their only home in London, where both were based for substantial periods of the partnership. PL agreed with DG that it would be used to fund their mutual retirement. This in itself is an example of mingling or merger. This was the way the parties organised their affairs. The London flat had a &#8220;central place in their domestic partnership&#8221; (per <span style="font-style:italic">Miller/ McFarlane</span>), was &#8220;treated as a central item of matrimonial property &#8221; per <span style="font-style:italic">K v L</span>. The Court is not engaged in an exercise of evaluating monetary contributions from mutual endeavours during the partnership. The question of whether DG did anything to enhance the value of the property during a medium term partnership, and the concept of passive versus active contribution, are irrelevant in this context: but domestic contribution to the running of the shared home must be relevant to the assessment of how the property was treated by the couple and its centrality to their lives. The London flat should not be regarded as PL&#8217;s separate ring fenced property just because of the initial contribution. Both homes are to be regarded as partnership property.</p>

The contributions have merged. Credit would have to be given to DG for the payment of the mortgage, accepted, albeit reluctantly, on PL&#8217;s behalf to have been paid from partnership money. It is impossible to calculate what proportion of the equity is represented by the repayment of the mortgage: there is no justification for not attributing capital growth to the funds which went to pay off the mortgage. </p>
