I was told by Professor Wyatt that it was unlikely that the degree of cognitive damage, if any, could be assessed until C1 was of school age, or even older.</p>

The Article 6 and Article 8 rights of the mother and C1 are engaged in this matter, but I remind myself that where there is a tension between the rights of the child on the one hand and the rights of the mother on the other, the rights of a child prevail: <span style="font-style:italic">Yousef v The Netherlands</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 210" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 210</ref>. </p>

He told me that as a consequence of being born into the toilet bowl and being in water, the diving reflex would have been engaged, that meant that C1 would not breath and accordingly would not drown.  But the adverse consequence of that is that his body was starved of oxygen.  He suffered hypoxic-ischaemic damage, a secondary consequence of which was brain damage.  There was an issue about what would have happened if C1 had been immediately removed from the toilet bowl after his birth rather than remaining in the toilet bowl for a considerable period of time. </p>

However there would still have been a prolonged delay before the ambulance crew arrived, during which he would have been exposed to severe hypoxaemia, which would have probably stimulated the diving reflex and hypothermia.  In addition there would have been a further delay before he arrived at the hospital. </p>

He  paused for a considerable period of time.  He said in terms that he could not understand how a mother could treat her baby like that.  I am satisfied that Z was genuinely affected by what the mother said to him of the circumstances of C1&#8217;s birth.  I accept his evidence that since that time he has tried to forget what was said and tried to put matters behind him. I conclude that it is that reluctance, that attempt to put matters behind him, which caused him to be reluctant to come to Court to give evidence.  I particularly note that he says that after his last conversation with the mother he was awake until 3 o&#8217;clock in the morning concerned about what he had heard.</p>

When in hospital, she did not want to see the child and she said that she wanted the child put up for adoption. It  was not until the first Court hearing in these proceedings in very early February, that the mother indicated that she wanted to have contact with C1. </p>

I am told that she has been advised, repeatedly, that it is very important for a small baby, but particularly important in respect of a child who is deaf, that you look the child in the eye so that the child can see your lips move, and that will assist him, in due course, speaking despite his disability and lack of hearing.  </p>

But notwithstanding, that advice to T, the mother has consistently not followed that advice and even now, for most of the time, holds C1 in a position where he is facing away from her. </p>

I also note in support of that finding that even after C1&#8217;s birth and even after assuring the guardian and the social worker that she had told her parents about C1&#8217;s birth, in fact it was many, many months before she in fact told the maternal grandparents of C1&#8217;s existence.</p>

	      <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>Three, I find that she failed to seek antenatal care when there was absolutely no good reason for not doing so.  The language barrier might have proved problematic, but, it was one that the mother could, if she had wished, overcome.  Indeed, because of her past obstetric history, she should have known that it was essential that she had antenatal care.</p>

If the mother was sitting on the toilet as she gave birth to C1 and the placenta, I do not know and have been given no explanation as to why there is so much blood across the floor of the toilet block, in particular around Cubicle 1.</p>

I find on the balance of probabilities that that was the plastic bag that was discovered in the Cubicle Number 1 afterwards. </p>

	      <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>I am driven to the conclusion, notwithstanding the traumatic event and the consequences for this mother having given birth in that way, that she then did seek to harm C1.  She positively sought to hide his birth.  That conclusion is inevitable, when despite aid being at hand, the mother did not cry out.  She did not ask for help.  She did not immediately say she had given birth and needed an ambulance.  She had lied to those work colleagues claiming that she had just suffered a heavy period, when that was simply untrue.</p>

	      <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>The fact that C1 had no blood on him when he was handed to L, in my judgment has only one of two explanations, either, and there was a great quantity of toilet paper on the floor in and around Cubicle 1, the mother, after giving birth to C1 wiped him down and then put him back in the toilet bowl and covered him over with a plastic bag, or she flushed the toilet when he was in the toilet bowl.  </p>

	      <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>On the balance of probabilities I find it is the latter that is more likely, because the photographs demonstrate not only a great deal of blood on the floor, but a great deal of water.  Professor Wyatt advised that the amniotic fluid would have been somewhere between half a litre to a litre.  If the mother gave birth on the toilet, that would all have gone down the toilet.  It is far more likely, in my judgment, that the reason for the significant amount of water on the floor, mixed with the blood, was because the toilet was flushed when C1 was in the bowl causing the toilet to overflow.  </p>

	      <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>I find that the mother left C1 in the toilet bowl for some 24 minutes.  She made no attempts to remove him from that bowl during that time.  Quite the reverse.  I am satisfied on the basis of those findings and of the expert evidence of Professor Wyatt that C1&#8217;s brain damage is significantly and materially worse than it would have been if he had been immediately removed from the toilet bowl by his mother, and in my judgment there is no reason whatsoever why she should not have done so.  She may not have been able to act rationally but she ought, in my judgment, to have acted instinctively, namely to protect her newborn child.  In my judgment the shock or trauma, as she may have suffered, would not have prevented her from acting instinctively.  Accordingly I am satisfied that C1 did suffer significant harm immediately after his birth and that that is attributable to the actions that I have just described of his mother.  Further, in light of those findings I am satisfied that C1 is at risk of suffering future significant harm, from his mother, and accordingly I am entirely satisfied that the threshold criteria of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31(2)</ref> of The Children Act is made out.  </p>

	      <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>Considering issues of welfare, I have to consider whether the mother can safely parent C1 now and whether I have sufficient information before me to make that decision.  The guardian advises me that she is satisfied from her enquires and knowledge of the case that this matter has been wholly competently and fully investigated and assessed and that there is no lacuna in the evidence in terms of assessing the mother&#8217;s ability to parent C1. I entirely agree.  I am satisfied that the local authority, and in particular the social worker, has worked closely with the mother and has given her every opportunity to demonstrate that she is able to safely parent C1.  </p>

In my judgment it is not in his welfare best interest to be cared for by his mother.  His needs, as a result of his brain damage, are complex. I am satisfied that the Local Authority&#8217;s care plan for him to remain in the long term care of his current foster carers, is entirely in his best interests.  I am told and I accept that the current foster carers have provided him with an excellent quality of care and with particular dedication for which the Court gives them its grateful thanks.  </p>
