This final hearing commenced on 17th July 2023 and was due to be heard over three days. This case now concerns three children: W, born on 20th May 2010, aged 13; X, born on 8th August 2021, aged two; and Y, born on 4th July 2022, aged one. Their mother is M. W's father is F1. X and Y's father is F2. I am told that both fathers have parental responsibility for their children. W is a competent child who is represented separately from her Children's Guardian and the Children's Guardian is Joanna Macaulay. The case previously also involved the children's half sibling, Z. A final order was made in respect of Z on 26th May 2023 when she was ordered to live with her father and she and he were discharged as parties to the proceedings.</span></p>

I am grateful to all of the advocates for the work that they have put into this case and am particularly grateful to Ms. Salter who has discharged her difficult task in this case with skill and ability.</span></p>

M has been known to the Local Authority since 2010 due to concerns about neglect, substance misuse, domestic abuse, mental health issues and the impact of that combination of issues on her ability to give her children good enough care. The children have been subject to a number of child protection plans but, according to the Local Authority, changes that were made had not been sustained despite the mother's engagement with those child protection plans.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-size:12pt">On 6th November 2022 an incident occurred between M and F2 in which it is alleged that she threw a hammer at him. The police were called and M was arrested. The police reported M to be intoxicated on that occasion. W and Z went to live with their fathers after this incident. The Local Authority say that their fathers took protective action at that stage but raised concerns about whether they had been too slow to do so. On 9th November 2022 M took X and Y to a maternal aunt's address and they stayed there with her and that other family until 18th November 2022 when M moved to the maternal grandmother's address with X and Y.</span></p>

She also accepts using cannabis during her pregnancy with Y. The Local Authority say that M also tested positive for cocaine use whilst pregnant with Y. M accepted that she had exposed the children to domestic abuse and had said unkind things to X. M accepted there were limited socialisation opportunities for X and that on an occasion the family was without gas and electricity. She denied being a perpetrator of domestic abuse.</span></p>

F2 accepted at the hearing on 16th January 2023 that he uses alcohol daily and occasionally used cocaine.</span></p>

They did not seek to remove the children from the care of any of the parents and sought interim supervision orders which were ultimately granted. During the proceedings M and F2 did not engage properly with the Parental Substance Misuse Court into which this case had been placed and they were discharged from that provision.</span></p>

They had not, and never did, issue an application for a placement order in respect of either child. In respect of W, the Local Authority sought for her to live with F1 and for a six-month supervision order to be granted. W went to live with F1 pursuant to an interim Child Arrangements Order granted on 26th May 2020 by His Honour Judge Williams. Sadly, W started to self harm and the family were left with no support from the Local Authority to manage those behaviours. F1, understandably, felt between a rock and a hard place enforcing the Local Authority's care plan without any support from them against a teenager who strongly objected to it.</span></p>

That requires: a paginated index to be sent to all parties not less than four working days in advance of the hearing; for bundles to be sent to counsel not less than three working days before the hearing; and for bundles to be lodged at court by not less than two working days before the hearing unless the court has otherwise specified a time.

I alerted counsel in this case by email on Sunday that the bundle that had been provided did not contain the evidence and contained documents that were illegible. I indicated in that email that I did not expect any response or any person to be working over the weekend on this case. Nevertheless, I am told that Ms. Andrews, a paralegal at BCP Council, has in fact been working diligently over the weekend and from the early hours of Monday morning to try and arrange a bundle for the court. I am most grateful to her. I note in passing that no witness bundle was provided by the Local Authority. That would have caused significant problems were evidence to have been heard. I do not know why the Local Authority did not provide a witness bundle for a hearing that was due to take three days and be fully contested. The Local Authority also failed to produce a witness template.</span></p>

No communications were sent to the court by the Local Authority to alert the court to the problem. The person tasked with rebuilding left on Friday lunchtime, I am told, to go on leave and without having completed the task. That left Ms. Andrews to sort it all out.

By that I mean that the Local Authority may have reached the conclusion that things were sufficiently good on the ground that they simply did not need to visit.
