Mrs Dickason attends before me with Ms Corrigan and Mr Dickason is not here for reasons I will explain in a moment.  This is an oral judgment and necessarily, in those circumstances, does not carry with it the craft, precision and clarity that would (I hope) apply if it were a reserved judgment. I am nonetheless clear as to the conclusions that I reach, however imperfectly expressed.</span></p>

On that occasion, as I recorded in the recitals to the order (p4), Mr Dickason did not attend this hearing. I also noted that, similarly, he had not complied with any directions in preparation for that hearing.  As Mrs Dickason notes in one of her subsequent affidavits that I will come to, Mr Dickason consistently failed to comply with orders in those proceedings, including orders with a penal notice attached to them, as the final order that I made in those financial remedy proceedings itself did.  </span></p>

That was sent on the second day of the final hearing; my recollection is that it was a medical reason although it is a long time ago now so I would not, to use a colloquialism, &#8220;bet my life on it&#8221;.  However, the Court did not accede to the application, drew adverse inferences against Mr Dickason and made an order, amongst other things, for him to pay periodical payments at a rate of &#163;1,500 per month, payable monthly, in advance, by standing order - paragraph 15 of the order.  I am told that a standing order has never been set up and I accept that.</span></p>

There was a hearing before Deputy District Judge Child which Mr Dickason failed to attend and Deputy&#160;District Judge Child made an order that Ms Corrigan could sign the forms on Mr&#160;Dickason&#8217;s behalf.  That is dated 16 March 2022 (page 14).</span></p>

On 20 March 2023, that application was struck out for the reasons that Mrs Dickason explains in her witness statement (page 88) - essentially, Mr Dickason was not attending and Mrs Dickason was advised, in the circumstances, innocently and erroneously I accept, that she did not need to attend.  As nobody attended, the Court struck the enforcement application out.  </span></p>

In fact, at the hearing of the final third-party debt order on 14 March 2024, HHJ Gibbons was erroneously informed by Investec that Mr Dickason&#8217;s account with them was in debit balance and, in those circumstances, HHJ Gibbons understandably discharged the interim third-party debt order.</span></p>

Certainly, in any event, the decision to discharge it would have required more serious consideration than HHJ Gibbons understandably gave on that occasion on the information then before her.</span></p>

I will therefore today make an interim third-party debt order on Mrs Corrigan&#8217;s undertaking to forthwith issue an application for a third-party debt order.  </span></p>

That would, in my view, be wholly inappropriate, particularly when the error is Investec&#8217;s, not Mrs Dickason&#8217;s.  Accordingly, I have no doubt that at least preserving the position by making an interim third-party debt order is appropriate.  However, that is an aside for present purposes.</span></p>

In her affidavit in support of the same (page 59), Mrs Dickason, as I earlier drew brief attention to, pointed out that Mr Dickason did not attend the final hearing of the financial remedy proceedings; that numerous orders were made by the Court with penal notices attached, all of which were ignored by Mr Dickason and also made reference to the final order on 6 December 2021 which bore a penal notice.</span></p>

Accordingly, that was, by my calculation, some 9 months before that witness statement was served.  Mrs Dickason also drew attention in her affidavit to various correspondence having been sent by her solicitor, Ms Corrigan, to Mr Dickason all of which, she said, had been ignored by Mr Dickason, again demonstrating a theme of his ignoring the proceedings, failing to engage and, it seems to me, doing all he can to evade the Court taking action against him.  Accordingly, that was how matters were at that time.</span></p>

There was no car there at that time.  He went to the next-door neighbour who confirmed that &#8220;If the car&#8217;s not there, they&#8217;re not there&#8221;.  The process server then returned later that day when a vehicle was there.  He records at paragraph 7 that he met with an adult female whom he knew from past service attempts cohabited at the property with Mr Dickason and so, I&#8217;m sure,  was Ms Farmer.   He noted that Ms Farmer in what appeared to him to be an evasive manner stated that Mr Dickason was not present and was not expected to return until very late that same evening or, perhaps, even the next day.  The process server records at paragraph 8 that he suspected that the respondent was present but was possibly avoiding service, particularly because he had only ever seen one car parked at the property before when Mr Dickason had been present and that was the same vehicle parked, to the best of his recollection, on that occasion.</span></p>

She noted that he had not attended court on 7 December 2023 or on 12 January 2024, again, demonstrating the theme of Mr Dickason failing to attend at court.

She notes, again, correspondence had been sent by her solicitors to Mr Dickason and he had failed to respond on every occasion.  She also notes at paragraph nine that Mr Dickason had been making payments to their son who was studying veterinary medicine at the University of Liverpool and had recently told their son that he would shortly pay the next year&#8217;s tuition fees in full.</span></p>

It seems to me that it is not strictly necessary for me to resolve that conflict (  I am of course conscious that the decisions in question are those of the higher courts) because it is, in my judgement, appropriate to draw an adverse inference in this case against Mr Dickason.  That is what I do in the circumstances.</span></p>

I am conscious that given Mr Dickason is not before the Court, the maximum penalty the Court can impose is a sentence of imprisonment of 14 days.  That can be immediate imprisonment or there can be an order for his suspended committal.  Given the circumstances in which he does not appear before me today and, ultimately, what Mrs Dickason&#8217;s seeks is not Mr Dickason&#8217;s imprisonment but payment of the sums due to her, it seems to me the appropriate course is to make an order for his suspended committal to prison, to be suspended on condition that he pays the outstanding sum due to Mrs Dickason of &#163;24,163 by 28 days from today, 24&#160;September by my calculation.  </span></p>

Secondly, if there is, indeed, a good reason for Mr Dickason&#8217;s non-attendance before me today - and I have already indicated that I am not satisfied there is on the evidence before me - he can apply to set aside my order.  Of course, if he produces good reason for his non-attendance, then the Court will listen to that and consider whether, indeed, my order should be set aside.  As I have noted above, if he pursues that course, that will necessitate his attendance before the Court so that will help the Court in dealing with the substantive matter in any event.  Accordingly, it seems to me that is an appropriate course.  </span></p>

If he does not pay that sum then, of course, in the usual way, Mrs Dickason will have to apply if she deems it appropriate to do so for the suspension to be lifted and the committal to become effective.  </span></p>
