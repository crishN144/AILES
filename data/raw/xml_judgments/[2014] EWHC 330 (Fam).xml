	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This private law dispute demonstrates a number of phenomena. Firstly, that it is sometimes possible to achieve real and substantial progress as the result of the hearing itself. Secondly, that there can be incalculable benefits from the simple exercise of parents giving evidence and, just as importantly, listening to the evidence of others. Thirdly, that proceedings which begin in an atmosphere of adversity may swiftly evolve into an exercise in constructive collaboration. Fourthly, that protracted litigation over children is profoundly harmful to everyone concerned. And fifthly, that the involvement of skilled and insightful professionals &#8211; in this instance Miss Wiley, Ms Bushell and Mr Kirkwood &#8211; has immeasurable advantages in (a) achieving a better understanding of the genesis of past problems and (b) assisting parents to an infinitely more constructive way of working together for the benefit of their children.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The very sad reality is that for more than 10 years there has been court conflict between the parents of twins, now twelve and a half years old. Various issues have arisen &#8211; parental responsibility, contact (how much, how often, staying or visiting, the arrangements for collection and delivery), the children&#8217;s last names &#8211; but overall the battle has been about the role which their father should properly occupy in the children&#8217;s lives. </p>

I listed the case for directions indicating that I would consider (i) the need for a fact finding hearing so as to better understand the reasons for the difficulties and inform &#8216;welfare&#8217; decisions; (ii) contact arrangements; (iii) the potential for the children to move to live with their father and / or any other person; and (iv) the mechanism by which the proceedings might be brought to an end.</p>

I spoke directly to both parents. I talked &#8216;tough&#8217;. I made clear to the mother, then represented by Solicitors and Counsel, that if I came to be satisfied, having heard evidence, that the children were being emotionally harmed as the result of her resistance to them having an ongoing, fulfilling and mutually rewarding relationship with their father then I would actively consider making changes to the residential arrangements. I also referred, if I&#8217;m not mistaken, to the potential for public law interim orders which could have required the children to move for a short period to live with foster parents in the event that I found the threshold for the making of such orders crossed.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Had I known then what I now know, I would not have been as robust. I have little doubt but that the impact upon the mother of what I said was considerable. She must have felt very anxious. But as well as accentuating the extent of my powers, I also made some practical proposals as to how the parents might interact with one another in their sons&#8217; presence so as to make their transitions from one home to the other a less tense and a more enjoyable experience. In particular, I suggested that when the boys were dropped off and picked up each parent should be made welcome in the home of the other, invited to sit down around the kitchen table and offered a cup of tea (or similar). </p>

The father, impressively, has taken the trouble to provide supplies of a particular health giving drink for the mother; and I&#8217;m sure the mother has been responding with similar thoughtfulness when he&#8217;s called in at her home.</p>

The covering letter described that the boys had come to her home on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February, so last Friday, at 5.40 pm. She &#8220;verified&#8221; that they had been left alone to write the enclosed letters &#8220;by themselves with no input or influence&#8221; by her or anyone else residing at her address.</p>

The parents had an &#8216;on / off&#8217; relationship for more than 12 years. They lived together but not all the time. Their relationship came to an end in December 2001 when the twins were less than six months old. The mother moved away from the family home in May 2003. The mother alleged domestic violence; the father denied any aggression or violent behaviour but agreed there were many arguments. </p>

It is sufficient to record that a few incidents during contact as well as at handovers have assumed an importance which, with the benefit of hindsight, was both unwarranted and disproportionate. More importantly, at the time and in the months even years that followed whichever incident, there was an evident willingness on the part of those who felt aggrieved to hold on to the sense they had been wronged.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This hearing developed in a way that no one could have predicted. The atmosphere on Monday morning was, predictably, adversarial. The mother did not have representation and applied for an adjournment which was refused. Some time was spent in trying to find a member of the Bar who might be prepared to act for her <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono. </span>I did my best but failed. Mr Kirkwood made inquiries within his Chambers but likewise without success. Miss Bushell in the spirit of helpful collaboration began by trying to locate a Mckenzie Friend. Those efforts came to nothing but she was able to enlist the assistance of Miss Francesca Wiley.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By Tuesday morning, having read the papers and having discussed the issues with the mother, Miss Wiley indicated there was a good prospect of an agreement. Notwithstanding such a positive development, it seemed to me that I would be shirking in my responsibility if I acceded to the implied suggestion that there may have been no need for oral evidence. My sense was that I could have been doing little more than applying a &#8216;sticking plaster&#8217; to a deep and persistently infected wound without enabling the beginnings of adequate treatment.</p>

It became apparent, almost as soon as the family members&#8217; evidence began, that their attitudes towards one another were by no means as hostile as had appeared from the papers. Just as importantly, it was obvious that the parents were listening intently to and seemed genuinely interested in everything being said. They seemed equally attentive when listening to various hypotheses posed from whichever quarter. I note in passing that the last time evidence was given was in January 2007 at the [named] Family Proceedings Court. </p>

They all expressed a ready willingness to seek to improve their interpersonal relationships for the future. The mother, to her very great credit, agreed that with hindsight she should not have asked for advice last week from someone unconnected with the case with the result that the boys were asked to write those letters. She has also, since last November and with very good effect, told the boys &#8220;they need to forgive&#8221; when they raise grievances about their father. The mother believes they, that is all the adults, should get together, sit down and discuss things. As she said, they &#8220;just want peace.&#8221;</p>

But there again, it would have been unrealistic to expect anything else. The maternal grandmother&#8217;s plea to me and perhaps most of all to the father was that the boys should not be &#8220;hurt&#8221; again. She berated the father for having failed to say &#8216;Good morning&#8217; to her at court on Wednesday morning; and yet she had not said anything to him either. The mother talked throughout her evidence about &#8220;visitation&#8221; rather than the part that the children&#8217;s father should be playing in their lives. Her husband spoke about his wife having been &#8220;dragged through the courts.&#8221; Some of the language used exemplifies the problems which have beset these proceedings. And yet, there was such ready willingness to think and interact differently on all sides.</p>

More surprisingly perhaps, the mother also thanked Ms Bushell. But given her immensely constructive, understanding and very largely non adversarial stance it was easy to see why she did. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So why did things go so badly wrong for this couple such that there was serious and persistent disagreement even although there has never been a valid welfare argument against ongoing contact? Peeling away the layers of mistrust and antipathy has been both painful for the parents but also, I would say, illuminating. In addition, it has been, as Mr Kirkwood so rightly says, cathartic. And the best demonstration of that is the scene he witnessed at lunch time on Wednesday when all the family members were together in the coffee shop, standing around and chatting.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To revert to the reasons for the difficulties, I would identify the following as having contributed to the atmosphere of hostility. The twins were alarmingly small when delivered &#8211; less than 3 lbs each &#8211; and had to stay in hospital for 8 weeks. Their mother had been ill herself in the period prior to their birth. Thereafter, the boys were not physically robust for a couple of years. The mother, entirely understandably, was intensely protective of them as was their closely involved maternal grandmother. It must have been a time of enormous stress and anxiety for the whole family, particularly the mother whose attachment to the babies, of necessity, was of the most concentrated kind. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father felt excluded to an extent though he would say he always did his best to support the mother and his children. During the twins&#8217; first year, the long standing relationship between the parents ended. Doubtless there was disappointment and a sense of loss on both sides. Inevitably, the maternal grandmother would not have been inclined to give the father &#8216;a good press&#8217; at that time or indeed in the years that followed. Clearly, she had views about his actions in the earliest months of the boys&#8217; lives which were highly unflattering and, I would have to say, very hurtful to him.</p>

Doubtless she was strongly encouraged, by successive CAFCASS officers and judges, to play her part in ensuring the smooth progress of a developing contact routine. Her husband and the children&#8217;s father are very different individuals. By trying to do right by her husband, there must have been times when she did wrong by the children&#8217;s father. She was criticised for the way in which contact handovers were undertaken at the children&#8217;s schools. She complained to various bodies when she believed her behaviour had been wrongly reported as having been confrontational. When a suggestion was made by Cafcass that her actions may have had a psychological or psychiatric component requiring of expert advice, she responded defensively. There was, as it is all too easy to see now, a downward spiral of alarming dimensions. </p>

A prime example of that lack of empathy and its harmful impact was the regularly repeated performance at the children&#8217;s schools on a Friday afternoon when the handover was effected. It was easily done; and could, with the benefit of hindsight, have been so straightforwardly avoided as the mother conceded in evidence. </p>

I am sure they became almost too much for her to bear; and the impact upon the children was a sense that their mother was under attack. They are and were both incredibly loyal to and, said the mother&#8217;s husband, fiercely protective of her. He could see though that the boys would have been far better off had they not been inappropriately exposed to the detail of the adults&#8217; dispute.</p>

Ms Bushell explained that the father is a shy man who would have encountered considerable difficulty if left to conduct the advocacy on his own. Having seen him give evidence, I agree wholeheartedly with that assessment. He is also, unsurprisingly given what he had lived through, extremely emotional, and would not have managed the advocacy task unaided.</p>
