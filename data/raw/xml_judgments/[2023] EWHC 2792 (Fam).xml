	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Once again, this matter comes before the court on the application of the local authority to commit Mr Farad Abdi to prison for breach of orders made by this court, with which it is alleged that Mr Abdi has failed to comply.  That application to commit is dated 21 September 2023 and was issued on 10 October 2023.  The father was served with the application on 19 October 2023 at 1605hrs by a prison officer, as confirmed by correspondence from the Offender Management Unit at HMP Pentonville.  The application alleges that the father is in breach of the orders made by this court on 11 May 2023 in the following terms:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father is again unrepresented before the court.  The present application to commit was accompanied by a letter from the local authority to the father dated 17 October 2023 explaining the application and urging the father to seek legal advice.  The father has not sought legal representation for today&#8217;s hearing.  As I will come to, he appealed the most recent decision of this court in May 2023 to commit him to prison.  That appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 20 October 2023. During the course of its judgment, the Court of Appeal noted that the father was entitled to free legal representation but had chosen to act in person.  At this hearing, Manchester City Council is represented by Ms Mann of counsel.  The mother is represented by Mr Miller of Counsel.  The children are represented by Mr Walker of counsel.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The substantive proceedings in this matter concern Mr Abdi&#8217;s four children. The substantive application before the court is an application by Manchester City Council for wardship orders in respect of the children and an order for summary return to this jurisdiction from the jurisdiction of Somalia, issued on 13 October 2022.  The children currently remain outside the jurisdiction.  Their precise whereabouts remain unknown, although the court has now received a statement from the mother in which she describes further information that has come to light concerning the children&#8217;s location.  That information was supplemented further during the course of the mother&#8217;s oral evidence to this court, in circumstances where the local authority relied on her statement in support of its committal application.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In dealing with the application to commit, I have had the benefit of an affidavit of the social worker, Anna Owen, dated 18 September 2023.  Ms Owen has been the children&#8217;s social worker since 12 October 2022.  Ms Owen gave oral evidence and was cross examined by the father.  As I have noted, the court also heard oral evidence from the mother, who was cross examined by father directing his questions through me. At all times, the father conducted himself calmly and his questions were, in large part, entirely germane to the issues before the court and forensically astute.  The father elected not to give evidence in his own defence, relying on his right to silence, but addressed the court on the case advanced against him by the local authority during closing submissions.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Each of the four children were born in the United Kingdom and were habitually resident in the United Kingdom at the time they were removed from this jurisdiction in March 2022 in circumstances I will come to. The father shares parental responsibility for the children. The parents are Somalian, although the mother is believed to have Dutch Nationality.  The court understands that the children have Dutch passports.   The parents themselves are related on the maternal side, meaning that many of the mother&#8217;s relatives are also blood relatives of the father.  This is not the case with respect to the paternal side, with the father&#8217;s paternal relatives having no blood link to the mother.  The local authority has been involved with the family since 2012.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As related in my first judgment, on 14 March 2022, police attended the family home. During cross examination by the father at this hearing, the mother conceded she told the police on that date that the father had said he would run away with the children but that the children did attend school that day and that the father returned them that evening. On 15 March 2022, the children spoke at school about their lives at home.  They alleged exposure to the parents&#8217; volatile relationship and made a number of allegations of physically and emotionally abusive conduct towards them on the part of the parents and significant allegations of ongoing domestic abuse between the parents. The children stated that they had been told that they must not say anything to anyone and that they would be in trouble if they did.  They described their parents as fighting a lot, and that they were &#8220;like a drama series&#8221;.  The children were fearful of their parents finding out what they had said and the parents were not informed of the allegations when they collected the children from school. A referral was made to children&#8217;s services by the school.  The children made further allegations to the school on 16 March 2022.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the days following these events, it became apparent that the children had left the jurisdiction.  When asked, both parents were less than forthcoming at the time about the children&#8217;s whereabouts.  On the 23 March 2022, the Police visited the family home and spoke to the father. He refused to give the specific whereabouts of the children other than saying that they were in New York. The police spoke to the mother and the children on phone but the mother was not forthcoming with information. On the 25 March 2022, a follow up strategy discussion was held whereby the Police shared that Border Force checks had showed that Mrs Yusef and all the children had flown to Istanbul on 18 March, not New York.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ahead of the first committal hearing, the mother provided a statement in which she conceded that she removed the children from the jurisdiction on 18 March 2022 in order to secure medical treatment for one of the children in Turkey.  The court was provided with documentary evidence corroborating that account.  The mother further alleged that thereafter, in April 2022 and under duress from the father and the paternal family, she travelled to Somalia.  The mother alleged that on arrival in Somalia she and the children were collected at the airport by the paternal uncle, Said Abdulqadir, and other males who the mother had never met before. The mother contends she felt extremely uncomfortable and intimidated, that her phone was immediately taken off her as was her passport and the children&#8217;s passports.  The mother states that she and the children were taken to a gated community in Mogadishu.  The mother repeated elements of this account during the course of this hearing and identified the gated community as a compound called Dar Es Salaam.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother returned from Somalia to the jurisdiction of England and Wales in April 2022 without the children.  The mother alleges that approximately two weeks after arriving in Somalia, she was woken in the middle of the night and forcefully removed from the property by the father&#8217;s cousin, Abdul Kadir, and forced into a car.  The mother further alleges that she was thereafter taken to the airport and put on a flight to England, landing in Manchester where the father met her.  The mother says the father stated that he would return to Somalia to recover the children and that she remained with him in the hope that he would do this as soon as possible.  A boarding pass for a flight home to Addis Ababa dated 6 May 2022 was located at the father&#8217;s property following his arrest.   At this hearing the mother contended that she spoke to the paternal grandmother in the last week of May 2022 and told the maternal grandmother that the father was not letting her speak to the children.  The mother contended that by this time she had no idea where the children were and was not allowed to speak to them.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother returned to Somalia in August 2022. At the hearing in December 2022, the court was shown an email from the mother to the children&#8217;s school dated 16 August 2022 stating that she did not know where the children were. She alleged that they had been kidnapped by the father and may be in the UK.   In her statement for the hearing in December 2022, the mother stated that whilst in Somalia she issued proceedings in the Somalian court in Mogadishu.  In that statement, she further contended that the Somalian Court issued a warrant for the arrest of the father&#8217;s cousin, Xiss Mohammed and that pursuant to the warrant the police were able to gain entry to latter&#8217;s property, which was empty. She exhibited to her statement a translation of the warrant.  Finally, the mother informed the court that her own father also flew out to Somalia to help in the search for the children.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I noted in my first judgment in December 2022, the mother alleges that during the period in which she was in Somalia the father sent her what she described at the time as a &#8220;voice note&#8221; threatening her and stating that she had no right to go to Somalia to search for the children without the father&#8217;s permission.   During the course of her evidence at this hearing, when the father pointed out that the exchange involves a conversation, the mother confirmed that the exchange in question is in fact a recording of a conversation between her and the father. As at the hearing in December 2022, at this hearing the father did not state in terms that it is not his voice heard on the recording, although he did seek to highlight the circumstances in which it was made, which I will come to below. The full transcript of the exchange is as follows:</p>

The mother confirmed in oral evidence that when the foregoing recording was made she was with her cousins, who included Abdullahi Ahmed.  She further confirmed that he is also a cousin of the father.  The mother further confirmed that these cousins were employed by the Somalian government and were helping the mother search for the children.  This help included what the mother described as &#8220;sit downs, meetings and phone calls&#8221;.  Within this context, I pause to note that this hearing, the mother stated that the last time she saw the children they were at the same gated compound called Dar Es Salaam in Mogadishu on <span style="font-style:italic">14 August 2022</span> (although in a different house).  The mother made reference to this fact on a number of occasions during her oral evidence, including citing his date as a reference point for when the children had been moved out of Mogadishu.  This appeared on the face of it to contradict the position presented by the mother to the court in December 2022 with regard to when she last saw the children.</p>

On that date, I found that the mother was in breach of the location order, in that I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the mother had failed in breach of that order to immediately hand over to the Tipstaff every passport relating to her and every identity card, ticket, travel warrant or other document which would enable her to leave England and Wales.  However, for the reasons explained in my judgment, considered that that breach was properly classified as a minor one, and imposed no penalty on the mother.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.5in">"Turning to the father, having regard to the evidence before the court I am satisfied that at the time the location order was executed, the father knew the then current location of the children.  Notwithstanding his continued denials, the voice note sent by the father to the mother, which the father did not deny or seek to dispute, proves beyond reasonable doubt that the father knows where the children are, as does the fact that he travelled to Somalia in May 2022, as I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did.  I accept the submission that the voice-message is incriminating and clearly suggests that the father knows the children&#8217;s whereabouts and had detailed knowledge of the mother&#8217;s actions in Somalia attempting to locate them.  In addition, I note that notwithstanding his purported worry concerning the children&#8217;s whereabouts, unlike the mother he has never reported them missing to the authorities nor sought the assistance of the court to locate the children in one of the alternative locations he has mentioned, namely Turkey or the United States.  I am satisfied that this is because he knows full well where the children are currently. When arrested and spoken to by police, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the father made no mention at all of the children being in Somalia, denying all knowledge of their whereabouts. The recording of the father&#8217;s statement on 18 November 2022 makes no mention of the children being in Somalia, the only reference to another country being to Turkey."</p>

I was further satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time the father was arrested, he failed to provide his passport and any other document which would enable him to leave England and Wales, and satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that on 18 November 2022 the father failed immediately to hand over to the Tipstaff every passport relating to him, or other document which would enable him to leave England and Wales.  In light of those findings, I sentenced the father to three months immediate imprisonment to reflect the fact that the father had spent nearly three weeks on remand ahead of that hearing.  In addition, on 5 December 2022, I made a further order under the inherent jurisdiction, requiring the father to facilitate the return of the children to the jurisdiction of England and Wales forthwith.</p>

I do not have the benefit of a transcript of the learned judges judgment, but I do have an agreed note of the judgment given on 16 February 2023.  It is clear that the father&#8217;s case at that time was that he was not able to contact family or friends whilst in prison.  HHJ Singleton found however, that the father had during the period that he was at liberty failed to co-operate with the local authority by providing details of family members or any meaningful information about the location of the children.  He had failed to provide the PIN number or passwords to his mobile telephones.</p>

Some of those relatives attended on 17 March 2023.  The remainder are subject to outstanding warrants to be executed by the Tipstaff.  In addition, HHJ Singleton ordered the father to provide the PIN numbers and passwords for the mobile phones belonging to him, which are in the possession of the local authority, to enable the examination of those phones to further see whether there is information that might assist in locating the whereabouts of the children, and securing their return to this jurisdiction.</p>

In particular, I noted, that the father has had multiple visits from social workers from Children's Services, to whom he could have given information confirming the whereabouts of the children, this court having found as a fact in December 2022 that he knew the whereabouts of the children in the jurisdiction of Somalia, in order that the local authority can arrange for their return. I further held that the father likewise had repeated opportunities to instruct lawyers, whom he could also have given information concerning the children's whereabouts, to cause their return to this jurisdiction.  I was satisfied that it was likewise possible for the father to contact members of his family in this jurisdiction whilst he is incarcerated.  Finally, I was satisfied that the father could have attended court to assist the court further with information he had in relation to the whereabouts of the children.  In the circumstances, I was not satisfied that it was a legitimate explanation for a failure to comply with the orders made by HHJ Singleton that the father has been subject to a custodial sentence for the duration of the orders.  With respect to the order concerning the PIN, I was satisfied that the father knew his own PIN code, that that information was in his possession and, had he wished to do so, he could have provided it. </p>

During her oral evidence at this hearing, the mother stated that she understands that the children are now in an area called Herale, a region located near the border with Ethiopia and were removed to that location soon after she saw them for the last time in August 2022.

During her oral evidence the mother contended that the paternal grandmother threatens her own family, does not care that the father is in prison and will not provide any information because she is angry that the father remains in prison.  The mother said she has tried to speak to the paternal grandmother but has only spoken to the father&#8217;s sister, who criticised the mother. In this context, the mother alleges that the paternal grandmother has a strong and malign influence as to whether the children should be returned to this jurisdiction. The mother told the court that it has been made clear to her if she wants the children to be returned the permission of the father is required.  </p>

The mother claimed to have been shouted at by some of those at court for making an application on the ground that, in Somalia, the father has exclusive rights to determine what happens to the children.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Judge in Mogadishu issued a summons that a cousin of the father should attend court.  The Judge directed him to arrange a family meeting of elders.  The cousin told the court that he had spoken to the father&#8217;s mother in the United States and tried to persuade her to authorise the return of the children to the mother&#8217;s care but that the paternal grandmother had threatened him to stay out of the family business and said it was nothing to do with him.  The cousin also claimed that the paternal grandmother was controlling the whereabouts of the children and there was nothing that family members in Mogadishu could do about it. The Somali judge is said to have indicated to the mother that such a family meeting was the only way that progress could be made and that there was no order he could make that would facilitate the children&#8217;s return to her care.  The mother relates that the judge tried to telephone a senior member of the father&#8217;s family in Somalia but he refused to answer the phone.  In this context the mother again asserted before the court that only the father or his mother can ensure the children are returned to this jurisdiction. The mother emphasised the fact that, contrary to that which the father sought to demonstrate in cross examination by highlighting their mutual familial links, those who hold the children in Somalia are not her blood relatives, but are relatives of the father and therefore will act only on his permission.</p>

Ms Mann further submitted that the father has failed to ensure the return of the children in that he has taken no positive action in that regard, either by way of meeting with the local authority to provide such assistance as he is able to recover the children nor communicated with members of his family to request the return of the children to the jurisdiction.  In this latter regard, on behalf of the mother, Mr Miller submitted that even though the father might struggle to make international phone calls from prison, he could write a letter or, more realistically, engage the help of relatives in this jurisdiction, who could communicate that children should be returned to this jurisdiction.  </p>

He ascribes the actions of the local authority to what he alleges is endemic racism by the local authority against the Somali and Jamaican communities in Manchester.  The father contends that he does not know where the children are and contends that they were last known to be with the mother in March 2022.  He made reference, as he did in December 2022, to his assertion that on 19 August 2022 he informed the police that he had rung family members in the United Kingdom to try and ascertain whether there were members of his family in Somalia that could help look for the children, claiming that he had no immediate family in Somalia and did not know of anyone that he could speak to in that jurisdiction, albeit that there may be distant relatives that could help.  As I noted in my judgment in December 2022, the day before on 18 August 2023, the father had made no mention of Somalia and stated he had no knowledge of the children&#8217;s whereabouts, claiming to be under the impression the mother and the children were in Turkey.</p>

In support of this, the father states since the order was made in May 2023 he has been moved constantly from prison to prison.   That assertion is supported to a degree by the evidence of the local authority, Ms Owen detailing no less than seven remote meetings with the father that had to be cancelled due to his prison moves.  As I have noted, whilst Ms Owen did, however, attend one such visit on 16 October 2023.  The father denies being told of this visit by the prison, and the local authority has not provided documentary evidence that he was so notified. In prison, the father contends he is denied access to support from the Offender Management Units in circumstances where he is what he termed a &#8220;civil prisoner&#8221;.  In particular, the father pointed to the fact that he has been deprived of his mobile telephones and that he does not hold telephone numbers and addresses in his head.  Whilst Ms Mann sought to allude, during her closing submissions, to evidence in the possession of the local authority regarding the father&#8217;s telephone calls in prison that evidence is not, perhaps surprisingly, before this court.  </p>

It would, as it seems to me, be sufficient for her to make the judge sure that the father could achieve the return of the child, for example through the siblings if not through the grandfather, and she might be able to do that without calling specific evidence to refute each obstacle successively raised by the father. Nor do I think that the only way contempt can be proved is by the mother adducing evidence that the family in Syria is ready, willing and able to assist in bringing about the return. All those facts are facts which it might be open to the judge in an appropriate case to find proved from the surrounding evidence so that he is sure.&#8221;</p>

Whilst the father cross-examined the mother on the evidence set out in her statement, he did not seek to challenge, and in any event in my judgment did not successfully undermine, the mother&#8217;s evidence that it is the paternal family who have control of the children in Somalia and that it is in the gift of the father or his mother whether the children return to this jurisdiction.  Although I had some reservations concerning the evidence of the mother in the context of statements she has made to the court previously, I am reinforced in each of these conclusions by the fact that, during his closing submissions, the father himself stated that the solution to securing the return of the children to this jurisdiction, given what he contended is the &#8220;tribal&#8221; composition of Somalian society, would be for both families to come before the Somalian court in Mogadishu for the matter to be resolved.  </p>

This would have allowed the local authority to interrogate the contents of those phones for clues as to the children&#8217;s current whereabouts and to ascertain potentially important contact details of persons who may be able to assist with the children&#8217;s return.  The fact of the father&#8217;s incarceration has, I am satisfied, in no way acted to prevent him from taking that course of action.</p>

I consider it unlikely that the prison would have facilitated the social worker&#8217;s attendance online but not notified the father of the meeting.  I am further satisfied that it has remained open to the father to communicate with relatives in this jurisdiction with the assistance of the local authority.  Whilst in the absence of him having access to his mobile phones it will have been challenging for the father to hold in his memory numbers and addresses, it has at all times since 11 May 2023 been open to the father to provide the local authority with the PIN numbers and passwords for his mobile phones and request the local authority provide him with the relevant numbers and/or addresses on those phones.  Whilst it may well be the case that the father is precluded from making <span style="font-style:italic">international</span> telephone calls from the prison, it has been open to the father to ask the local authority to communicate on his behalf in an effort to secure the children&#8217;s return.  In any event, I am satisfied the father is be able to add domestic numbers to his allowed numbers in custody in order to communicate with paternal relatives in this jurisdiction with a view to seeking assistance to persuade his relatives in Somalia having control of the children that the children should be returned, as repeatedly ordered by the English court.  The fact that the mother is able to communicate with maternal relatives in Somalia who are also relatives of the father does not relieve the father of his responsibility in this regard.</p>

First, it upholds the authority of a court by marking the disapproval of a court, and deterring others from engaging in the conduct comprising the contempt.  Secondly, it acts to ensure future compliance.  In some cases therefore, and in particular those cases where the contempt arises from the breach of a court order, a penalty will have the primary objective of ensuring future compliance with that order in addition to marking the court&#8217;s disapproval.  In this case, any sentence is designed both to mark the court&#8217;s disapproval of conduct by which a parent refuses to comply with orders of the court designed to secure the return of children to the jurisdiction of this court and to secure future compliance with such an order.</p>

This will involve consideration of the facts of the individual case in order to decide whether a further term of imprisonment is both necessary and proportionate in the circumstances.  In reaching that decision, the court will take into account the past orders and the cumulative amount of time already spent in prison, having some regard where appropriate, to the likely sentence that might be imposed by the criminal court for similar conduct (see <span style="font-style:italic">Wilkinson v Anjum </span>at [38]-40]).</p>

In the circumstances, the court must satisfy itself that its sentence continues to contain an element of ensuring future compliance, and has not become simply punitive in nature.  In the words of McFarlane LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Wilkinson v Anjum </span>at [41], whether the &#8216;carrot and stick&#8217; approach has reached the end of its useful life, or in the words of Hughes LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Wilkinson v Anjum </span>at [53], whether or not the coercive effect of the current order is yet spent.

Had the Appellant abducted two children from the jurisdiction and been prosecuted the indictment would have charged the abduction of each child as separate counts. If he had been convicted on both counts after a trial the maximum possible sentence would therefore have been 14 years, not 7 years imprisonment. Of course, as Mr Bentwood rightly points out, in the event of pleas of guilty at the earliest opportunity the Appellant would have been given a discount of one third from the notional sentence after a trial and, if consecutive sentences had been imposed, they might well have been reduced to some extent to reflect the principle of totality. But I do not accept the hypothesis that the total sentence could not have been well in excess of five years imprisonment. I agree with the view of the judge that this is as bad a case as could possibly be imagined.&#8221; </p>

In the circumstances, four young children continue to be absent from the jurisdiction of their habitual residence, outside the care of both of their parents, and without oversight of the local authority that has an obligation to promote and safeguard their welfare having regard to the matters that arose immediately prior to the children being removed from the jurisdiction.

There was also some evidence before the court that, at present, the paternal grandmother is a driving force behind the retention of the children in Somalia. This however, does not absolve the father from assisting the court by complying with its orders.  The court is able to address the role of the paternal grandmother, if any, by the use of a High Court witness summons and by seeking the assistance of the relevant authorities in the United States.  Finally, it was also suggested that anger in the paternal family at the imprisonment of the father may be affecting their willingness to co-operate with this process.  Again, this does not absolve the father from assisting the court by complying with the orders that are made against him with the aim of achieving the return of the children to this jurisdiction.</p>

With respect to the likely sentence that might be imposed by the criminal court for similar conduct were the father to be convicted of the offence of child abduction in respect of the removal of the four children from the jurisdiction, as in <span style="font-style:italic">El Zubaidy v Borg</span> the analogy is not a precise one not least because this is said to be a case in which the children were removed under coercion by the paternal family as opposed to having been removed from the country by the father himself.  However, I am satisfied that were the father to be convicted of four counts of such an offence he would likely to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment significantly in excess of 2 years. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In considering whether a further term of imprisonment is necessary and proportionate in respect of the breaches of the order of 11 May 2023, in the circumstances of this case I must further satisfy myself that such a sentence continues to contain an element of ensuring future compliance, and has not become simply punitive in nature.  This is not a case, I am satisfied, in which a stalemate has been reached whereby the father is flatly refusing to return the children to the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  Rather, this is a case in which the court is satisfied that the father has not, and continues not to, comply with orders made by the court to achieve that end when he is, to the satisfaction of the court, able to do so.  The father himself during the hearing stated that he wishes the children to return to the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  This court has found there remain steps that the father is able to take to achieve that end.  I am satisfied the harmful effect on the mother and the children of their continued and enforced separation continues to speak the urgent need for the father to take those steps.  In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that the coercive element of a custodial sentence can be said in this case to be spent.  It is not yet obvious to the court that the coercive element provided by a term of imprisonment has evaporated in this case.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, with very considerable regret having regard to the father&#8217;s moving description of the impact his imprisonment has had on him and in circumstances where the solution in this case so obviously lies in the father complying with the orders made by the court to secure the return of the children to the jurisdiction in circumstances where he is able to do so, on the particular facts and circumstances of this case I again consider that the appropriate custodial sentence for the two breaches is one of a total of twelve months' imprisonment. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Consistent with the principles that I have articulated above, I have considered whether it would be appropriate to suspend the sentence I am imposing.  Having regard to the matters I have set out above, and in particular having heard the father state during the hearing his wish for the children to return to Manchester, it was my hope in this case that it might be open to the court to suspend any sentence, or at least to adjourn sentencing in this matter, to provide the father with a further opportunity to take steps that would amount conditions on a suspended sentence or to mitigation at the point of sentencing.   However, for the reasons I have set out, I am satisfied that my hope was a forlorn one.  In the absence of any confirmation on the part of the father that he is now willing to agree to meet social worker in order to assist the local authority, to provide the PIN and password for his mobile telephone or to take any other step towards securing the return of the children to this jurisdiction, in my judgment suspension or adjournment of sentence would serve no purpose.   In such circumstances, I am satisfied that at this time there remains no reasonable alternative to an immediate sentence of imprisonment.</p>
