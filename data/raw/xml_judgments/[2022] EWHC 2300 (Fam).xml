Unfortunately, there were various technical problems during that hearing, including the father&#8217;s repeated loss of connection to the hearing or with his interpreter. There were also a number of power cuts in Pakistan, which again led to the father losing connection with the hearing. I emphasise that these problems were not the fault of either party. However, the net effect was that considerable court time was lost. It became necessary for the court to find further time to conclude the case. Whilst a proposed follow up remote hearing was arranged for 29 July 2022, due to a failure on the court&#8217;s part to arrange interpreters for the parents, that hearing was abandoned. A further follow up remote hearing did take on 15 August 2022.</span></p>

It is his case that the removal to England amounted to an abduction. If this had been a Hague Convention case, it would have been his submission that the removal to England was wrongful and that the child&#8217;s habitual residence had not changed from Pakistan at the time of his subsequent application. He seeks the child&#8217;s summary return to Pakistan. In the event that his primary application fails, he would continue to seek an order for the child&#8217;s return to Pakistan following a full welfare evaluation in this jurisdiction. As part of that contingent case, he seeks an order for interim direct contact with the child in the hope that he can obtain a visa to travel to the UK.</span></p>

Once again, if this had been a Hague Convention case, it would have been her submission that the removal to England was not wrongful. Furthermore, it would also have been her submission that the child&#8217;s habitual residence had changed from Italy to England at the time of the father&#8217;s application. She disputes that the child has ever been habitually resident in Pakistan. She opposes the child&#8217;s summary return to Pakistan. In the event that her primary case fails, she has confirmed that she would return to Pakistan with the child. By contrast, if her primary case succeeds, she agrees, in principle, that there should be an order for interim direct contact between the father and the child in this jurisdiction if father is able to travel here. Further to that aspect of her case, she also asserts that she would assist the father in any application he may make for a visa to come to the UK.</span></p>

Further, in the light of the policy in favour of the making of substantive welfare determinations by the courts of habitual residence, is there need for inquiry into the child&#8217;s habitual residence at the relevant date (paragraph 57). I return to this aspect of the judgment later in my judgment; (c) In order to sufficiently identify the child&#8217;s welfare in such an application, an inquiry should be conducted into any or all of the aspects of welfare specified in section 1(3) CA89 and a determination as to how extensive that inquiry should be (paragraph 58); (d) If allegations of domestic abuse are raised, engaging PD 12J, does there need to be an enquiry into these allegations, and, if so, how extensive should that enquiry be (paragraph 59); (e) What are the details of the proposed arrangements for the return of the child (paragraph 60); (f) Is oral evidence from any of the parties required and, if so, on what aspects of the case (paragraph 61); (g) Whether a Cafcass Officer should report (paragraph 62) and</span></p>

In non-convention cases the court must act in accordance with the welfare needs of the particular child (paragraph 18); (b) There is no basis for the principles of the Hague Convention to be extended to countries which are not parties to that convention (paragraph 22); (c) A power did remain in accordance with the welfare principle to order the immediate return of a child to a foreign jurisdiction without conducting a full investigation of the merits (paragraph 26); (d) A trial judge had to make a choice, having regard to the welfare principle, between a summary return or a more detailed consideration of the merits of the parties' dispute in this jurisdiction (paragraph 26-28); (e) In making the above choice, the focus must be on the individual child and the particular circumstances of the case (paragraph 29); (f) It is wrong to say that there should be a 'strong presumption' that it is 'highly likely' to be in the best interests of a child subject to an unauthorised removal or retention to be returned to his country of habitual residence so that any issues which remain can be decided there. The most that can be said is that the judge may find it convenient to start from the proposition</span></p>

A case against his doing so has to be made. However, the weight to be given to that proposition will vary enormously from case to case. What may be best for the child in the long-term may be different from what will be best for that child the short-term. It should not be assumed that in allowing a child to remain in this jurisdiction while the future is decided inevitably means he or she will remain here forever (paragraph 32); (g) A number of variable factors are relevant, amongst all the circumstances of the case, in deciding whether to order a summary return or not (paragraph 33 to 40). I deal with these variable factors separately in more detail below and (h) Any decision about whether to order a summary return or not should be taken swiftly even if this is to a country that is very different (paragraph 41). I shall also return to this factor later in more detail in the judgment.</p>

Factors such as the child&#8217;s nationality, where he has lived for most of his life, his first language, his race, his ethnicity, his religion and culture, and his education may be relevant; (b) The length of time spent in each country is important. Although removing a child from one country clandestinely may well not be in his interests, if he or she is already familiar with this country and has been here for some time without objection, it may be less disruptive for the child to remain a little longer while his or her medium and long-term future are decided than it would be to return summarily; (c) The different approach of the foreign legal system may be relevant. The extent to which this may be relevant depends on the particular facts. It would be wrong to say that the future of every child within the jurisdiction must be decided according to the domestic concept of welfare. Nevertheless, differences between legal systems are relevant and may be decisive e.g. whether genuine welfare issues between the parties are capable of being tried in the courts of the country to which a return is sought. If not, the court must ask itself whether it is in the child&#8217;s interests to enable that dispute to be heard in this jurisdiction.

However, as also made clear in Re J (Child Returned Abroad: Convention Rights), the weight to be given to that proposition will vary enormously from case to case, the proposition is not determinative and the proposition falls to be weighed against other matters. In this case, weighing the competing factors, I am satisfied that a welfare case against the summary return of the children to Pakistan is made out&#8221;.</span></p>

Whilst conflicting orders remain in force, he is effectively denied access to his country of origin. Nor has his mother been enthusiastic about his contact here. The best chance that K has of developing a proper relationship with both parents, and with the country whose nationality he holds, is for the Texas court to consider where his best interests lie in the long term.

The question of habitual residence is ultimately a purely factual one and is to be determined by reference to all the circumstances of the child&#8217;s life. There is no rule as to the duration of the residence. It is possible to acquire habitual residence in a single day. However, the deeper the child&#8217;s integration in the old state, probably the slower his or her integration in the new state. The greater the adult pre-planning of the move to include arrangements for the child&#8217;s day-to-day life, probably the faster the child&#8217;s integration. Similarly, where all the central members of the child&#8217;s family have moved, probably the faster the integration takes place. Where some central members of the child&#8217;s family remain in the old state, representing a continuing link with the old state, the slower the rate of integration</span></p>

But to attach any significant weight to such impressions in assessing credibility risks making judgments which at best have no rational basis and at worst reflect conscious or unconscious biases and prejudices. One of the most important qualities expected of a judge is that they will strive to avoid being influenced by personal biases and prejudices in their decision making. That requires eschewing judgments based on the appearance of a witness or on their tone, manner or other aspects of their behaviour in answering questions. Rather than attempting to assess whether testimony is truthful from the manner in which it is given, the only objective and reliable approach is to focus on the content of the testimony and to consider whether it is consistent with other evidence (including evidence of what the witness has said on other occasions) and with known or probable facts.&#8221;</span></p>

It is one of a line of distinguished judicial observations that emphasise the fallibility of human memory and the need to assess witness evidence in its proper place alongside contemporaneous documentary evidence and evidence upon which undoubted or probable reliance can be placed . . . But a proper awareness of the fallibility of memory does not relieve judges of the task of making findings of fact based upon all of the evidence. Heuristics or mental short cuts are no substitute for this essential judicial function. In particular, where a party's sworn evidence is disbelieved, the court must say why that is; it cannot simply ignore the evidence&#8221;.</span></p>

However, he also says that on some occasions he has been able to meaningfully interact with the child, who has appeared happy to see him.</span></p>

However, there is protective legislation, together with a relatively effective court service in place, for those women who are, as a consequence of rather more positive personal circumstances, willing and able to take advantage of the same.</span></p>

By contrast, the mother reported that the child was scared during contact and hits herself with toys around contact sessions. Unfortunately, this account was shared in the interview in the presence of the child before it was translated. Ms O then made arrangements for the child to be moved from the interview, fearing what else the mother may say in her presence that would not be helpful. When Ms O spoke to the mother about her concerns, she replied that she and her family try not to talk in front of the child about the father because when they do the child becomes worried and says &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">why do you force me to talk to him and things like that</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8221;.

The mother pointed out that, although the child is young, she remembers what happened to her.

However, it became clear that he inserted the references to B [Town] in the school application form in October 2020.</span></p>

Whilst I am not going to determine the allegations of domestic violence as part of this judgment, I do comment on what appear to be several inconsistencies and other concerns in relation to this aspect of her case. The mother in her schedule, makes allegations of violence on specific limited occasions. In her first statement she asserts that throughout the marriage the father would be &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">very violent</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8221; and &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">physically abusive</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8221; towards her when there were issues with obtaining a visa for him.

She later alleges the father &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">physically assaulted me</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8221; in May 2020 and that she was &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">assaulted again</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8221; in July 2020.

This was with the intention of him visiting the child in 2018 when mother had been away for a number of months and he had not met the child. There was reference by father to a possible second visa application in 2018, which was to be made by the mother&#8217;s brother.

For completeness, the father was also involved in running his family&#8217;s business in Pakistan throughout this period; (f) The child, as an Urdu speaking Muslim child, would have been exposed to her birth culture and language throughout this period; (g) The child attended a pre- school nursery in Pakistan for part of this period.</span></p>

The child&#8217;s father and her extended paternal family were still present in Pakistan, as were members of her extended maternal family. Her nationality had not changed. She retained the right of abode there. She was being brought up in an Urdu speaking Muslim home.

Whilst she had been in England for in excess of 12 months, she had not, in my judgment, sufficiently integrated. I have found as follows: (a) Her period in England has to be seen in the context of a number of earlier international moves and her periods living in Pakistan; (b) In view of her past integration in Pakistan, the slower will be the attainment of sufficient social integration in England; (c) She was not enrolled in any nursery over this period; (d) She was living at home with her Urdu speaking mother and members of her Urdu speaking maternal family; (e) Some of the members of the maternal family had been away for periods of time up to November 2021. It was said that the visa application was not made until December because the paternal uncle, who had to make the application, was not in the country. The maternal grandmother was also back in Pakistan during part of this period; (f) I am satisfied that all of the members of the maternal family present at times with the child in England had much closer connection with Pakistan than England. Their respective connections were, if anything, stronger with Italy than with England; (g) Her grasp of the English language was probably very limited over the relevant period, allowing for her age and stage of development, in the light of the language spoken at home. I note Ms O&#8217;s evidence as to the child&#8217;s improved grasp of English by the time of her face to face meeting in March 2022. On any view, the child had been in nursery by this time; (h) There was a degree of uncertainty as to the child&#8217;s long term presence in the UK over this period; (i) There were very significant ongoing ties for the child with Pakistan at this time;</span></p>

In terms of health cover, the Pakistan government effectively provides citizens with basic health insurance, which can be supplemented by private health provision.

The same point applies to the father. No issue has been raised about members of either side of the child&#8217;s extended family as part of her family support network. I digress to note that the father suggests that the maternal grandparents may have exerted a malign influence in terms of bringing about the mother&#8217;s removal with the child to England.
