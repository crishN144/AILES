I heard evidence from both the parties and heard submissions and decided to reserve my judgment.  This case raises the difficult question of the appropriate level of support for a second wife where there were no children of the marriage (although the wife&#8217;s children of a previous relationship were treated as children of the family but who are now all over the age of 18) where the assets in the case were derived entirely from the husband&#8217;s pre-relationship endeavours.  The complicating factor is the wife&#8217;s mental ill-health which I will set out in detail in due course.  </span></p>

The total value of the assets is between &#163;15,000,000 and &#163;16,000,000.  That difference is immaterial.  It is agreed that this is a case where I must assess the wife&#8217;s needs for financial support and where I am not sharing the assets.  The wife&#8217;s needs allow the Court to invade the non-matrimonial property accumulated by the husband.  On any view the husband will be able to meet his own needs.</span></p>

The husband is 63 years of age and is a businessman.  His modus operandi is to invest in promising businesses in the hope that some of those investments will be successful whilst acknowledging that some will be unsuccessful.  The wealth that is now available came in large measure from one such successful investment.  The husband was previously married.  From that marriage, he has three adult children.  Sadly, one of those children is severely disabled.  That child lives with his first wife.  He has a son from a previous relationship.</span></p>

A compromise was reached in those proceedings which then became the subject of a final order.  The most important element of that order relevant to these proceedings is the provision that was made for the husband&#8217;s disabled son.  The husband pays &#163;15,000 per month towards his care.  In their financial settlement, they agreed to set up a fund to pay for that care requiring each of them to contribute &#163;3,000,000.  That fund has never been established.  I have reached the conclusion on the evidence I was shown that the husband in unlikely to be called on to pay into the fund in the near future.</span></p>

In addition to anything he must pay to his second wife, he says he may also have to find in relatively short order, a further &#163;3,000,000.  It is undoubtedly the case that some of his investments are illiquid and some of his funds are tied up, certainly in the short-to-medium term.  </span></p>

He has &#163;1 million in the bank.  His investments and policies are valued at approximately &#163;5 million.  He has business interests worth approximately &#163;3 - 3.5 million.  He has a pension of &#163;900,000.  There are chattels etc. including furniture that reflect the parties&#8217; lifestyle and there are Ferrari and Bentley motor cars.</span></p>

He has in the past had directorships which have paid him relatively modest incomes.  In practice, the family have lived off capital gains and the realisation of investments with those being received with limited tax consequence given that he has also made losses.  The calculations done by Mr Trowell KC and Mr Bennett suggest that the &#8220;income&#8221; of the husband towards the end of the marriage (that is income and capital available to spend) was approximately &#163;500,000 per annum.  That would be consistent with the lifestyle that it was demonstrated these parties have enjoyed.</span></p>

She has not worked, and it is accepted by the husband that she has no earning capacity.  She has three children from a previous cohabiting relationship.  She exited that relationship with &#163;500,000 being her share of the proceeds of sale of a house.  By 2020, all that money had been absorbed into the husband&#8217;s assets.  I will deal with that in due course.  She is entitled to be treated as a fully contributing spouse.  She introduced into the marriage all the money she had.  Her children were treated as children of the family.  She supported the husband through his first divorce proceedings.  She looked after the family.</span></p>

Currently, the wife continues to live in it and the husband is in rented accommodation.  They married in 2017 and separated in July 2022.  For the purposes of my assessment, this is a 10-year relationship and to be treated as a 10-year marriage.  It is certainly not a short marriage, neither is it of the longest type.</span></p>

That manifested itself in 2014 when she attempted suicide at a time when she tells me she was happy and in a loving relationship.  Despite that, she became seriously unwell.  Things took a turn for the worse in 2023 during these proceedings.  There have been two serious suicide attempts the second of which led to a period in a psychiatric unit and a conclusion by her treating psychiatrist that she lacked litigation capacity.  That coincided with the case being listed for final hearing in November 2023.   She is much better and was certified as having capacity in mid-December 2023.  Whilst I am no expert, it is obvious that she remains fragile.  </span></p>

In fact, there are two reports that have come in from the treating psychiatrist, the first to support the adjournment of the final hearing in November 2023 dealing principally with the issue of the wife&#8217;s lack of litigation capacity.  I have had a more recent report filed in support of the wife&#8217;s application for special measures.  I have, of course, read those reports in the light of the applications they were put in to support.  It is the wife&#8217;s case that her mental ill-health and fragility have financial consequences.  Whilst the husband acknowledges the wife&#8217;s mental ill-health, his case, through Ms Harrison KC, was that absent psychiatric evidence dealing with the wife&#8217;s long-term prognosis and specifically the need for support that would have financial consequences, I should not be led down that route. </span></p>

Since her most recent ill-health where the two suicide attempts coincided with her being at home alone, her mother and her stepfather are proposing to live with her, and she wishes to accommodate two of her three children whilst they establish themselves financially.  More significantly, because on any view, she will have enough money to accommodate the people she wants to live there, she says her choice of home is limited geographically by needing to be near her friends and within walking distance of recreational facilities.  She suggests that she needs to live in one of the most expensive areas of North&#160;Cheshire as that meets and is the only place to meet her criteria.  It is, of course, her mental ill-health that she asserts generates those needs.  Insofar as it is relevant to the exercise it appears that her mental ill-health has developed during the relationship although there is no suggestion that it is &#8220;relationship-generated&#8221;.

The wife explained that her initial calculation in her Form E was based on the lifestyle enjoyed during the marriage.  There have been maintenance pending suit proceedings for which a more modest budget was produced and that award together with the sums paid by the husband in respect of the family home suggests that she has been receiving in payment and in kind, approximately &#163;100,000 per annum.  The argument is that when she moves to a much more modest house, she will not need that level of funding.  In evidence, she trimmed her figures further.

The larger and the more expensive the home she buys, the more it is likely to cost and the quicker she will go through the finite amount of money she has available to her.  A more modest house would undoubtedly be cheaper for her to run, then she might be able to make savings.  It was said on her behalf that she may need further periods of in-patient care which will be expensive.  A cost of &#163;20,000 per stay seems likely.

With great respect, that is not a sound submission.  I am familiar with housing costs to the south of Manchester and the north of Cheshire.  I regularly have cases before me involving houses from that part of the world.  I can take judicial notice that there is a wide range of housing stock in that part of the world and the wife will be in a strong negotiating position as she will be a cash purchaser.  I am quite satisfied that if I award her &#163;1,000,000 under that heading, she will be able to pay for a house, the appropriate tax on purchase and will be able to equip it.  Precisely how much she spends is a matter for her and she will have a total fund to cover her housing and her maintenance for the rest of her life with which she will have to budget.

Her costs in total are more than double those of the husband and she has run up fees far greater than his in the run-up to and including this final hearing.  Mr Trowell and Mr Bennett have said both in writing and in oral submissions that the scale of the wife&#8217;s fees reflects her ill health.

What I am not doing is bringing it back into account.  Ms Harrison argued that a claim for the outstanding legal fees was tantamount to seeking a costs order against the husband.  Mr Trowell characterised the outstanding costs as part of the wife&#8217;s needs, i.e., it is money that must be paid and can only be funded by the money received from the husband.  Both are right.  If it were a costs order, then the husband would be entitled to have it assessed by a costs judge and there is authority to suggest that if I take it into account now, I must carry out a rough-and-ready assessment of that sort myself.  </span></p>

I am persuaded that this wife will have incurred significantly more in legal fees than would a litigant not suffering from her ill health.  Having seen her give evidence, I can see why far more time would be needed with her than would be needed, for example, with the husband.  Doing my best and applying a quasi-assessment of what might be ordered if it were a costs order and looking at the overall fairness of how this should be paid, the husband should pay two-thirds of the wife&#8217;s outstanding legal costs, an additional lump sum of &#163;177,300.  What in part has driven my assessment of fairness is to look at the parties themselves.  It is not the wife&#8217;s fault that she has ill-health.  The husband is not to be punished because he married someone who was, in due course, to succumb to ill health.  It is one of the facts of the case that cannot be ignored.</span></p>

She seeks a period of four months from the date of payment of the first lump sum and in the expectation that she will have the total payment in time to buy her home.  My expectation is that she should certainly have the &#163;2.5 million offered by the husband within four months of the date of this judgment being received by the parties.  That is the period I am going to give her to move out.  If the money is paid earlier, then she should move out on payment.</span></p>

Instead, it was decided by the parties that they were content for the husband to provide his own valuations subject to challenge.  I am satisfied that the husband gave me realistic evidence as to valuation.  His evidence illustrated that expert evidence might have been misleading and/or completely out of date as he referred to board decisions and investment decisions by others that have had and continue to have a direct impact on valuation and the prosect of him recovering a profit or a return of his investment.</span></p>
