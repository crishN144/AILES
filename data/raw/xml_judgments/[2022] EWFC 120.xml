	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court is very grateful to both Mr Powell and his instructing solicitor, Mr Spearman, who have acted pro bono for the applicants in this case. Their excellent written documents have provided clear analysis of the issues the court is being asked to determine. The court has also benefitted from the expertise of Ms Stanley, Cafcass Legal, who represents W and X. At an early stage in the proceedings she provided a comprehensive document setting out the issues in the case, both legal and factual. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before turning to the details of this case it is important to highlight, once again, that before embarking on a surrogacy arrangement (particularly one that involves arrangements in other jurisdictions) intended parents should have a clear understanding about what is required to secure their legal position in relation to any child born as a result of such an arrangement. To do otherwise leaves the future of the much longed for child at risk, in particular of not being able to secure the lifelong legal parental relationship between the intended parents and the child in the jurisdiction where they wish to live. By failing to take these steps prior to a surrogacy arrangement takes considerable risks in relation to any child born as a result of such an arrangement, and could be said to be an abdication of responsibility intended parents have towards that child.</p>

They entered into a civil partnership on 15 July 2013 and converted this to a marriage on 30 December 2019. They wished to have a family of their own through surrogacy and began making enquiries about this in 2017, initially in the UK but due to the delays they were informed would occur here they decided to look abroad. In their initial statement they state <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;There exists an incredible number of agencies online who all claim to undertake surrogacy in various countries regardless of the intended parents sexual orientation and despite the laws that may exist within a country. We naively thought some of these were acceptable options&#8217;.</span></p>

This agent suggested Georgia. The applicants describe in their statements that they did not appreciate any problems there, they were aware other same sex couples had been there, had not encountered any issues and understood it was being approached from the perspective of what they describe as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;hidden acceptance&#8217;.</span> Following their own researches they were aware surrogacy was permitted in Georgia, however it was not an option as a same sex couple although there was no requirement to prove that you were married. They understood a number of same sex couples had undertaken surrogacy arrangements there, they describe in their first statement they were aware of the difficulties but were driven by an <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;overwhelming desire to be parents&#8217;.</span> Later in their statement stating <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;We had researched the US but the cost was out of our reach and Canada had a long waiting list and was also expensive. We knew our only option of ever being parents was to undertake surrogacy in a country where we were possibly not following all of the regulations. Georgia seemed like the safest option&#8230;&#8217;</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The initial agreement they signed with the agency was for $30,000 and involved transporting their embryos from Cambodia to Georgia. Following two unsuccessful embryo transfers to a surrogate in Georgia the agency informed them that further IVF was required to create better quality embryos. Due to the increasing costs the agency also suggested they changed to the Guaranteed Pregnancy Programme which cost $40,000, which they did in July 2019. Through the agency the applicants selected a new surrogate, V, and two embryos were transferred to her in November 2019 and a twin pregnancy confirmed. Due to Covid restrictions the applicants did not travel to Georgia to meet V and attend scans, as they had planned. </p>

It is clear from the background to this case that included the applicants managing the health difficulties caused by the premature birth of the children, the difficulties encountered in managing the travel restrictions in 2020, the pandemic restrictions that continued in 2021 and the demands on the applicants in caring for W and X all contributed to the delays in the application for a parental order being made. If the application is not able to proceed that is likely to impact the children&#8217;s welfare, as any other orders do not give the lifelong security a parental order provides. It is unlikely Parliament would have intended that outcome. Proceeding with the application does not have an adverse impact on any third party, yet if it doesn&#8217;t proceed it will have a significant impact on the children&#8217;s best interests, denying them the opportunity to benefit from an order that provides lifelong legal security to the legal relationship with those who care for them. In the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied the application should be permitted to proceed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dealing with the issue of payments other than for expenses reasonably incurred it is clear the arrangement in this case involved such payments, which require authorisation. Save for the payment of $1,010 for the passport application the payments were made in accordance with the agreement between Y and the agency, or were listed in that agreement as not being included in the package price. The payment relating to the passport application was not referred to in the agreement, was paid in September at the time the passport application was signed and did not relate to any of the matters set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s54(8)</ref>. The children were already in Y&#8217;s care, the Georgian passport application was made due to the delays in the application for a British passport and were to enable Y and the children to travel to join Z and return to Thailand. Whilst it may be said the applicants&#8217; good faith may be open to question as they were aware when they entered into the arrangement that Georgia did not permit same sex surrogacy arrangements they have candidly set out that they relied in good faith on what they were told by the agency and from the experience of other same sex couples who have undergone surrogacy arrangements there. In addition, the applicants accept their judgment was clouded by their desire to become parents and the difficulties they had encountered to do that. It is also right that the account the applicants gave in support of their initial application was incorrect, however they took steps to correct the position and British passports for the children were granted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court does have a number of concerns in this case about the way the applicants acted. Whilst fully understanding the situation they were in wanting to fulfil their wish to become parents and the difficulties they had experienced in being able to achieve that, it does not mean that understandable wish can be pursued irrespective of the consequences for any children born as a result of such an arrangement. The applicants have admitted that their judgment was clouded, that they were aware of the restrictions about parties to a surrogacy arrangement in Georgia but say they relied upon what they were informed by the agency they used. Whilst that may be an explanation of why they did what they did it does not absolve them of responsibility. It needs to be understood that situations such as in this case can result in the court refusing to make a parental order. </p>
