	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">These proceedings concern HP born in 2013.  In a few weeks&#8217; time, he will be 5 years old.  For the whole of his life, bar the first 8 weeks, he has been cared for by the second cousin of the father and his partner (&#8220;the carers&#8221;).  He has had not contact with his mother for four years.  He has had no contact with his father except for, it appeared in the evidence, some brief telephone contact last year and the year before. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">In August 2017, LA2 issued a without notice application before the court since when HP has been a ward.  The authority subsequently issued care proceedings in November 2017.  This inquiry, spread over six days, has investigated how HP came to be placed in the custody of the carers, and how or why he has remained there, and why neither parent has any relationship with him.  That enquiry has principally involved the four main adults, the parents and the carers, but it has also involved the statutory agencies of the local authorities who have been involved more or less continuously since HP&#8217;s birth.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">There is an avowed acceptance on behalf of each party that each has contributed, and bears a responsibility for, the current situation as indeed I find they have, but there is considerably less agreement on precisely how and where that responsibility falls.  HP believes his carers are his parents.  He believes that their children are his siblings.  He has absolutely no knowledge at all of, and therefore obviously no relationship with either of his parents.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">My first involvement with the case was on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>October 2017.  There had previously been some debate about the correct application before a number of Judges of the Division.  There was enquiry about the parents whose whereabouts were unknown.  At that time, the local authority and the guardian were represented and the male carer appeared in person, unrepresented.  Happily, because of the issue of the care proceedings, shortly after that and despite my exhortations to the Legal Aid Board in the wardship proceedings, the issue of representation became academic, representation being resolved by the local authority&#8217;s application, their stance now set out more fully in the care application was that the carers had unlawfully refused to return HP to the care of his mother and had actively taken steps to prevent her from maintaining contact with her son.  These are strong allegations. </p>

	    <num>5</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">The physical manifestation of that perspective was that having never apparently questioned the care provided by the carers (it is not now questioned either), the local authority, having for many months, indeed over a year in one instance, effectively left the carers to their own devices (at least in 2015), started making visits again to check on the welfare of HP.  The relationship between the carers and the applicant local authority plummeted, it was already poor, but by that stage clearly reached rock bottom.  There was not just a lack of mutual trust but I am sorry to say there was some relatively unbridled hostility.  It manifested itself in the approach and actions of the LA2 which was tunnel visioned, intent apparently on immediately establishing direct contact with the mother, and disregarding any other view to the contrary, including that of the courts.  It led to some fairly difficult exchanges in those early direction hearings between the bench and counsel.  It is a long time since I have encountered such an unhappy, blinkered and partisan approach.  Of course, the reaction of the male carer who was the person who at that time was attending court, who like his partner is something of a force to be reckoned with, was predictably challenging and uncompromising, and understandably hostile.  It was, on every level, an unhelpful development. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">Before turning to the background and the evidence, I wish simply to record the legal principles.  The applicant applies both in wardship and in care.  This is a fact finding hearing.  It is not now suggested, as I understand it, that the threshold triggers are not met.  I apply the principles set out by Baker J, as he then was, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re L and M (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/1569" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 1569 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 1569 (Fam)</ref>.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">The situation for HP is unusual and the ultimate welfare decision is going to be a difficult one.  It might, depending on the factual matrix, be difficult to justify on welfare grounds nuclear changes to his care arrangements.  The simple fact remains that both authorities who were involved with HP right at the outset could have avoided the process which the parents and the carers have had to go through now.  A number of possibilities arise.  It is correct that the first local authority, LA1, was suggesting to the mother effectively a section 20 accommodation but what, I ask myself, of section 17 of the Children Act? </p>

	    <num>9</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">Had the proper principles been applied and followed either local authority could have considered, in relation to LA2, probably should have issued an application under section 38 of the Children Act.  Not one but two authorities at least failed to apply their minds to the provisions and guidance with regard to private fostering.  They seemed, indeed notwithstanding the issue of proceedings, having regard to the witnesses I have heard in evidence, possibly still seem, unaware of the extent of their responsibilities that are placed upon them.  Had they done so, HP&#8217;s circumstances would have been investigated and established in the first few months of his life.  He would not now be facing the very difficult path which, inevitably, results from this dispute.  It would have established for him a clear future.  It would have maintained the parties&#8217; relationships, and the lost opportunities, and there have been many, all occurred because neither local authority applied the principles which are straightforward and easily understood.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">HP&#8217;s parents are from Eastern Europe.  They arrived in England when the mother was just 18 seeking work in March 2013.  It was understood by the mother that the father had work, but that was not borne out.  Their early time in this country was unsuccessful and by the time of HP&#8217;s birth, they had failed to establish themselves.  They had no money, they had no effective work, they were homeless.  HP and his mother were discharged from hospital in June 2013 they having been kept there a little longer because of their destitute circumstances.  They sought refuge in various places.  Their applications for temporary and emergency housing sometimes were granted, but ultimately it failed. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">By July 2013, when HP was only 5 weeks old, the local authority offered an emergency foster placement for that night.  HP and his mother spent the night in a refuge and throughout that period, the parents, the mother in particular, sought help on a number of occasions.  They were, in short, quite destitute.  There is no suggestion other than HP was properly and well cared for by his mother, but it is difficult to imagine a more desperate situation.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">Ultimately, LA1 deeply anxious about the circumstances being provided for HP, made rather more assertive suggestions about accommodation into care.  That precipitated, or appears to have done, the father contacting his second cousin, who also lived in the United Kingdom to care with his partner for their very young baby.  So it was I think the very same day in July 2013, that HP, together with a very few possessions, was handed over to the care of the cousin and his partner on the pavement in Westminster.  The two women were strangers.  They had not previously met.  Since that time, HP has been cared for ever since by the female carer. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">The evidence suggests that the mother saw HP on a couple of occasions before the fateful meeting in August 2013.  On that day, the four adults attended Social Services at LA1, and there entered into a private fostering agreement.  The parents confirmed that HP&#8217;s living arrangements would extend beyond 28 days but could not say how long.  It is clear that the intention was that they would look after HP until the parents had sorted out their financial and housing situation.  That arrangement was notified on to LA2, the applicant in this case, where the carers resided.  I say immediately that it is self-evident from what occurred that day and since that almost none of the necessary requirements and regulations were complied with. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">Almost immediately, and in my view a sign of things to come, the parents, no doubt particularly swamped by their practical and other arrangements, had very little to do with HP at all.  The mother, as I say, had seen HP on a couple of occasions before August (and had had some help from the female carer in preparing a CV).  However, after HP was handed over, she saw HP on no more than a handful of occasions.  There is some dispute, though it is not heavily contested, as to how many, but the evidence suggests that the mother saw HP on five occasions over the next year.  After the summer of the following year, she never saw him again, nor sought to do so. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">In any event, importantly, the parents failed to attend the absolutely vital meeting arranged by LA1 and the carers in August.  By mid August, although this has become a criticism of the carers, it is evident that both they and the authority itself were giving thought to consideration of the long-term, since it appeared that the mother had simply abandoned her baby to the cousin.   </p>

The evidence suggests that there was a meeting when the mother saw HP and the carers in early September.  It was on that occasion, it seems to me, that the allegation of the sum of &#163;250,000 arose. </p>

	    <intro>

There are a number of peculiar things about that.  The LA2 did not set about seeing the carers immediately, but only went to see them in early October coinciding with the social worker&#8217;s appointment to the case, and whatever the local authority&#8217;s position now (alleging that the carers deliberately were avoiding disclosure of the mother&#8217;s details), the bald fact is that on that date in September, the mother&#8217;s solicitors explicitly sent the local authority her address.  For reasons which will always remain a mystery to me, the social worker did absolutely nothing about it until seven months later by which time the mother unsurprisingly had clearly moved on.  It is evident that the social work recordings demonstrate requests to the carers, but ultimately, I see that as further evidence of a failure </p>

What is curious is that at the important meeting in October 2013, whilst the social worker did not show the carers the email, she told them that the mother wished to resume HP&#8217;s care and no longer consented but, bizarrely, indicated to them that they, the carers, should set about obtaining further agreement for the care of HP.  That meeting was a seminal moment in what has happened to HP from that time until now. </p>

The LA2 reports the carers as saying that they had not heard from the parents for several weeks.  Examination of the detail suggests that that is not exactly so.  The father and the male carer were it seems in some contact and it is evident, having regard to the correspondence and the case notes, that there was a line of communication at least to the father, and quite possibly to the mother also. </p>

The father was about to return to Poland.  He consented to there being a special guardianship order and he wished to bring him to meet the social worker; such a meeting could have taken just moments.  The social worker&#8217;s response, she after all maintained consistently that she was concerned, interested and urgently needed to speak to the parents, was surprising and unhelpful.  She simply batted off the enquiry.  She had, I think, some meetings that day and told them to make an appointment.  Thus, another opportunity was lost.  As predicated, the father returned to country of origin in the middle of November 2013, which is where he remains.   </p>

What has become blindingly obvious is that the parents, the carers, and the local authority each bear some responsibility to the situation which now pertains to HP.  There are fundamental issues at large which will require later determination.  In broad terms, the factual dispute is, firstly, did the mother abandon HP to the care of the carers?

The first social worker (from LA1) was the person responsible for the signing of the private fostering agreement in early August 2013.  She became aware that the arrangements that she was endorsing had already come about some days before, in fact, I think, in late<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>July.  This was the first of a number of occasions when the statutory authorities, perhaps understandably reacting to circumstances that were presented to them, failed to engage in any sensible enquiry.  There was none in respect of both the carers or of the mother&#8217;s circumstances.  I do not understand why there was not some exploration, for example, about their statutory duties under section 17 to assist the mother and the father.  They could have done significantly more.  Not for the only time was the authority passive, even supine. They acted as little more than a facilitator and then, as far as I can tell, passed the case over to the current authority. </p>

She, like the previous witness, seemed unaware of the extent of her statutory duties.  It was not, after all, until 2017 that, realising the true impact of the situation, that proceedings were finally instituted.  I am afraid I have concluded that much of her recorded activity was little more than &#8220;going through the motions&#8221;.

She was after all, an experienced social worker, based in the kinship team, and responsible for supervising both care and special guardianship assessments, but I became increasingly troubled by the content of her evidence.  Her first visit to the carers was, as I have recorded, in October 2013 by which time she had received the communication from the solicitors instructed by the mother withdrawing her consent.  All the warning lights should have been flashing.  She says that she was &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; about the private fostering arrangement.

She says that the carers claimed that they did not know the whereabouts of the parents.  That may or may not have been the case since the parents moved from place to place but the fact remains, and this is the second matter which I am concerned about, that if the social worker was so interested in locating the mother as she said she was, why on earth, having received the communication from the solicitors in late September where the details of the mother&#8217;s address are so plainly set out, did she not do something about it?  It was only the following year, seven months later, did she finally attempt to write to the mother in late April 2014.  It is a total mystery to me why months and months elapsed in a process about which I simply do not have a clear understanding.  Unsurprisingly, when she did write several months later, the mother was no longer there and therefore the opportunity had been lost. </p>

She said that she had made repeated efforts to try and locate the parents but despite her protestations to the contrary, the evidence shows that when she was presented with a powerful opportunity to identify their whereabouts, she failed to take it.  Such efforts as she did make were half-hearted and inevitably too late.  Of course, she subsequently made many efforts to learn their whereabouts, but lost each and every opportunity to do so.  There was I am afraid, no sense of focus, no sense of urgency.  She was evidently given various numbers in respect of the father and an address, and finally spoke to the father&#8217;s mother, the grandmother; but even that inexplicably took her 6 weeks.  She also received the email in June 2014 purporting to be from &#8220;the father&#8221; relinquishing all rights to HP. </p>

She claimed to be extremely worried about the situation, she said she had never been handed and never seen the emails.  Stepping back, I am unconvinced about that evidence.  Having regard to her approach in relation to other aspects of what occurred, I take the view that the female carer, who does not always have the easiest manner, as part no doubt of the discussions that took place, did proffer the emails but actually the social worker, rather in line with her curious conduct generally when she was presented with golden opportunities, often first hand, to discover addresses (ibid), failed again to note the address, took the view that as they were in the carers&#8217; mother tongue (and therefore unintelligible to her), she was not prepared to receive them.  I am well aware that the female carer (whether it be the early part of 2014 or later) failed to comply with the early orders for disclosure.  It is an unsatisfactory part of the evidence.  By February 2014 the carers had learned how to brush off the social worker and did so.    </p>

She did not have a clear recollection of what had occurred.  The involvement of the social worker clearly followed a visit to the carers, possibly the visit where both parties had exchanged or endeavoured to exchange their views in September.  The mother emailed the carers on 16 October asking for photographs.  The female carer replied in October, her reply was forceful and, in the circumstances, not unjustified, as to her perspective at that time.  Having regard to those communications, and the two that followed later that month, the carers, whilst already really fond of HP, were exhorting the mother to grow up and take responsibility.  The solicitors had written but the mother had failed to follow it through.  The mother&#8217;s recollection of that period was unclear.  She self-evidently felt powerless and useless.

In due course, the mother told me that she had started a new relationship.  She still is in daily contact with the father of their child and her second son. </p>

There were, I am afraid to say, moments when the father appeared to verge on the surly although I suspect that was, at least in part, because of the medium for his evidence and I make due allowance for that.  His evidence was not particularly persuasive.  He confirmed that he had been in trouble, that he had been to prison, and had been involved in a number of serious of matters thus supporting the evidence both of the mother and of the carers. </p>

He also told me that the male carer had his details from 2017 both telephone and email and the evidence, such as exists, would support that contention.  Much of the contact appears to have been through his mother with whom he was living at that time.  The evidence, in any event, demonstrates and I accept it, that there was some conduit of communication between the two men for most of the time even when the father moved, as he frequently did, or changed numbers or addresses.  The father was completely clear that he supports HP remaining with his carers.  He does not support, for a number of reasons, a return to the care of the mother. </p>

She knew that they might be providing care for more than 28 days, and was clear in the view that the long-term arrangements were first raised by the authority and not by her.  She disputed many of the contentions which were put to her in evidence, correcting even counsel when she considered that a statement had not been put to her accurately. </p>

She did have information to hand which may, or may not have borne any fruit but she could have produced it.  Where I differ is that I do not think those criticisms of the carer are as corrosive as is maintained.  The female carer is a complex, dynamic person overtaken by events, certainly overtaken by her impatience either with an individual or, in this case, the parents and subsequently the local authority in particular reflecting her anger and reflected also in the anger which I witnessed and heard at first hand from the male carer at the early court hearings.

Of course, the advent of the proceedings effectively pitted the two parties against each other.  I do not think she has always been entirely straight.

I do not think that that amounts to poor or, even as it is submitted, Machiavellian conduct.

His identity is evident from the forms, it seems to me a good example of reading far too much into something which, in fact, has an innocent explanation; </p>

The mother says it was unconnected.  I conclude that it was connected albeit that the mother was by that stage herself homeless, and again destitute, but also the subject of statutory enquiry.  In my view, her approach to things was such that she thought that her best interests would be solved by her returning to Eastern Europe and that is what she did.  What I am clear about is that she told no one.  </p>

When HP was 8 weeks old, he was handed over by his young mother to strangers and since 2014 has had no relationship with her at all.  She did not persist in maintaining that bond.  The mother&#8217;s visits to see HP were few.  As far as I can calculate, there were possibly five in all. </p>

She sought to regain the care of her son by the letter in September 2013 but did not follow it through.  The only communication subsequently was in October when she asked for a meeting and a photograph of HP.  That no doubt precipitated the 3 emails in October.  Those communications are pretty forceful but I do not agree are insensitive.  They are very direct, but in my view, they needed to be. </p>

It is, as I say, flavoured by the carers&#8217; frustration, but it is clear by then that the mother was dropping out of HP&#8217;s life and continued to remain out of HP&#8217;s life.  None of the communications that were made by the carers were responded to by the mother in any shape or form.  By the end of the year, the two women were apparently on reasonable terms.  Something must have led to that, an acquiescence of the current situation.  The mother, as I have indicated, last visited in July 2014.  I prefer the carers&#8217; accounts of that. </p>

The mother did it herself.  She returned to country of origin in January 2017 and she was, even when her whereabouts were known, somewhat difficult to pin down.  The mother recently has gained more strength, she registered HP&#8217;s birth in country of origin and indeed has got nationality in that country for him in January of this year notwithstanding the fact that he was subject to a wardship order, and also a child arrangements order in favour of the carers. </p>

A situation has been allowed to develop for which, as I have said at the outset, each party is responsible from a welfare perspective.  The mother has effectively faded from her son&#8217;s life and now for four years has had no contact with him at all. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">Fundamentally the failure of the authorities in this case were such that they simply did not assess the real situation.  They did not make sure that the parties were clear.  They did not visit the home.  They did not visit the carers or the parents.  They did not, for example, make sure that there were contact details and addresses.  They did not make sure that the proposed contact that should have occurred between HP and his parents was clear so that everybody knew about it.  They did not establish that the arrangements were agreed.  I doubt very much that each party was clear about their rights and their duties.  There was no clear decision, no clarity about the day to day arrangements, and the assessment which eventually came to light was of itself incomplete.  There were sometimes gaps (often big ones) when visits were not made.  There were many lost opportunities.  The first, it might be thought, was on 2 August 2013 and the second, most glaringly, on 4 October 2013.   </p>

Actually, it may well have been, but it became evident that by the time that 28 days had elapsed and, in any event, by the time the mother was withdrawing her consent in September, it clearly became unlawful and the outcome for HP might well have been very different had the authorities applied themselves properly to the statutory framework, regulation, and procedures which are easy to understand, as I say, and could have been applied and implemented properly at that time. </p>
