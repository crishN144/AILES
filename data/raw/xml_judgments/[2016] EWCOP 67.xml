	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">These proceedings in the Court of Protection concern a young man who I shall refer to as &#8220;D&#8221;, who is twenty-six years old and was a member of the Armed Forces and who, tragically, in 2013, sustained a serious brain injury following an assault by another member of his regiment.  As a result, he has been left with a permanent disability, or certainly an indefinite disability, and has, for the last two years or so, been living in a rehabilitation unit run by the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">D has undergone a long and arduous process of rehabilitation following treatment in the unit and has made some progress but continues to suffer from significant disability.  His mother, who has shown complete dedication to her son, has explored options for future treatment and, in particular, has made enquiries about the possibility of stem cell therapy.  That form of treatment is not, as I understand it, at present available in this country, nor elsewhere in Western Europe, but is performed in certain countries, and in particular D&#8217;s mother has ascertained that it may be available for her son at a unit in Moscow.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In support of that application, D&#8217;s mother has filed a statement exhibiting documents, in particular emails from D indicating that he would wish to undergo that treatment and, in addition, documents from the unit giving particulars of the treatment and the medical and scientific basis for it, including references to a number of research articles about this highly complex form of therapy. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The application was served on the Ministry of Defence, who had originally been the applicant to this court when the orders were made in 2014.  In addition, a further issue has arisen, concerning D&#8217;s future residence, which has led the Ministry to make a further application to the court.  It is unnecessary for the purposes of this short judgment to refer to that application in any detail. </p>

She has instructed Irwin Mitchell, who have, in turn, instructed Ms ButlerCole today, and Ms Butler-Cole submits that D&#8217;s mother falls squarely within the rules as to an appropriate person to act as a litigation friend in these proceedings.  She acknowledges that D&#8217;s mother has a firm view as to the merits of the proposed treatment, but rightly refers me to authority that the fact that a proposed litigation friend has a view as to the outcome does not disqualify that person from acting as litigation friend. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.03in">QC, with Mr Beck from the Official Solicitor&#8217;s office, have appeared before me today to explain that, although the Official Solicitor&#8217;s position is, of course, that he is the litigation friend of last resort, in the circumstances of this case, if the court thought it appropriate to invite him to act as litigation friend, he would accept that invitation. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In the course of her brief submissions, Ms Dolan drew my attention, without producing written documentation, to the fact that a brief trawl of the internet demonstrates that stem cell treatment is a topic of some controversary, certainly in Western Europe, where it is not, at present, available as a clinical procedure.  It is available in certain countries, including Russia, but Ms Dolan contends this is a decision which is going to require careful analysis by the court on the basis of expert evidence. </p>

The facts of that case are somewhat different from those of the present case.  In particular, it should be noted that that case concerned a dispute between family members as to the right course to be taken in respect of P.  It does, however, in my view, provide important guidance, albeit only from the court of first instance, and I note in particular the observation of Charles J at para.21 onwards of the judgment, where he says: </p>

However, it seems to me that he or she would need to demonstrate that he or she can, as P's litigation friend, take a balanced and even-handed approach to the relevant issues.  That is a difficult task for a member of the family who is emotionally involved in the issues that are disputed within the family and it seems to me an impossible task for AF to carry out in this case.  One only has to look at her statements to see that she is clearly wedded to a particular answer.  You do not see within her statements a balanced approach or anything approaching it, such as: &#8216;This is the problem. These are the relevant factors for and against&#8217;.  That is not a criticism.  Rather it seems to me that it is a product of the result of there being long-standing family disputes and the existing clear divisions of opinion within the sibling group as to what will best promote UF's best interests.&#8221; </p>

Now, I do not blame her for holding that position.  I can well understand a parent in that position taking that approach but, having regard to the overriding objective which underpins procedures in the Court of Protection, in particular the need to ensure that a case is dealt with expeditiously and fairly, and that P&#8217;s interests are properly considered, and that the case is dealt with in a way that is proportionate to the nature, importance and complexity of the issues, it does seem to me that it may be difficult for her to act as a litigation friend with the degree of competence and fairness required in this case, which seems to me to raise unusual, indeed seemingly novel, issues for this court. </p>

First, nothing I have said should be read as implying any criticism of D&#8217;s mother.  To date, everything I have read in all the documents put before the court demonstrate that she is utterly dedicated to her son and to doing whatever she can to help him in the very difficult and sad circumstances in which he now finds himself.   </p>

My mind remains open and will remain open until all the evidence has been adduced and considered.  It does not follow that the court will necessarily adopt the view of the expert.  The court&#8217;s obligation is to make a best interests decision on the basis of all the evidence, including D&#8217;s own wishes and feelings and the views of members of his family. </p>
