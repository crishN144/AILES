In the event that the gateway/permission hearing were to result in the case proceeding to the next stage, the Defendants were to file and serve any evidence upon which they intended to rely immediately upon the determination of the preliminary issues.  Miss Shuman indicated to me at an early stage of the hearing that, in this event, her clients would also want to issue a witness summons in respect of a third party, a solicitor who had previously represented H.  Thus, the reality was, and is, that if these committal applications are to proceed, further dates will need to be listed for the next hearing.</span></p>

H is the father of a child (B) who is now 10 years old.  He is a Bulgarian national who has lived in England for the past 12 years.  In 2004, he had a relationship with B&#8217;s mother.  They separated before either knew that she was pregnant.  The child was born the following year and, from the outset, H established a relationship with his daughter.  For the next few years, there was regular contact between them.  He describes himself as &#8216;a model of fatherhood&#8217;.  He states in his written evidence that he made the journey from London (where he lives) to Birmingham to see the child regularly, without fail, over a period of seven years for staying contact.  He supported the child financially at a rate over and above that which he would otherwise be required to pay.  </span></p>

The child was manifesting some problems at school and appears to have said that she no longer wished to see her father.  That fact was communicated to the father by the mother.  H was devastated by this turn of events which he puts down to the influence of B&#8217;s mother and maternal grandmother whom he suspected of wishing to marginalise him in B&#8217;s life, if not exclude him from it altogether.  I heard much over the course of this hearing about parental alienation syndrome and Mr Graham, H&#8217;s McKenzie friend, told me at the outset of the hearing that he did much work for a well-known organisation called &#8216;Families Need Fathers&#8217;.  Indeed, it was apparent during the course of the hearing that a number of sympathisers or members of that organisation had attended court to listen to proceedings from the public gallery.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">When contact broke down in the summer of 2013, H enlisted the support of the local social services who produced a report.  That core assessment report supported several of H&#8217;s concerns about the underlying reasons for the difficulties in the parental dynamic and its impact upon B.  A social worker had arranged a meeting between H and B in a local park in an attempt to re-start contact.  It was unsuccessful.  The analysis of the problem provided by the social worker was that B&#8217;s loyalties were very much divided between her parents and she had been exposed to adult conversations within the home which were, in turn, impacting upon her relationship with her parents.  It is a distressing account of events which are rehearsed far too often in the family courts.  H was urged by social services to make an application to court and their file was closed.</span></p>

Although Mr Graham sought to criticise the First Defendant for his handling of the case from the very outset and before the first order was made on H&#8217;s application, he accepted that the time line in terms of my evaluation of these applications can only run from November 2013.</span></p>

At this stage, it is sufficient to note that, by the time Mr Yalland had made his final submissions to me on the law, it was apparent that there was no basis whatsoever upon which a committal application against the First Defendant, Mr Dent, could proceed and, on H&#8217;s behalf, Mr Yalland sought permission to withdraw the committal application in respect of Mr Dent.  I indicated that I would deal with that application as part of my judgment in relation to the entire case when I had considered the preliminary aspects of the case against the Second and Third Defendants on the permission / strike out aspects.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">For reasons which I shall explain, I consider that there is no merit whatsoever in any of the three committal applications which are before the court.  The application against the First Defendant, Mr Dent, has been withdrawn by H and, insofar as he needs the court&#8217;s permission to withdraw that application, he has it subject only to any issues which might arise in relation to costs.  I consider that the applications against the Second and Third Defendants have no legal basis whatsoever.  They are, as the claimant accepts, procedurally flawed in fundamental respects and I decline to waive those procedural defects since I consider that justice and fairness require me to take that course for reasons which I shall explain.  Given the clear objectives which lay at the heart of these applications, as those objectives were articulated to me by Mr Graham, I consider the applications constituted an abuse of the court process.  H is denied the permission which he seeks to proceed to the next stage of these applications, the latter two of which will be struck out.  Each of the Defendants is now relieved of any further concerns as to their future liberty and/or the potential impact of these proceedings upon their professional careers.  Notwithstanding the fact that I have allowed H to withdraw his application against the First Defendant, Mr Dent, I am proposing to explain in my judgment why I take the view that the case against him is entirely without merit.</span></p>

Unbeknown to either, he had been illicitly and covertly making tape recordings of what had transpired during the discussions outside court between them.  He had made similar unauthorised tape recordings of his visit to Cafcass&#8217; offices on 15 April 2014 and his interview on that occasion with Ms McKay.  He has since produced transcripts of these recorded exchanges, parts of which are reproduced in his written evidence in support of the committal applications.  The USB stick which he has produced contains some 5 hours of clandestinely recorded material.  Abbreviated versions of the transcripts and recordings have also been made available; counsel for the Defendants accepts that the transcripts are more or less accurate.  H invited me to listen to the content of a USB stick which was handed up at the conclusion of submissions.  I promised him that I would do so, and I have kept that promise.  For reasons to which I shall come, it is not necessary for me to analyse in any more detail the substance of the exchanges which I have now heard.</span></p>

He alleges that she abused her position of trust to persuade him that the court was likely to dismiss his application for parental responsibility because of the implications it had for the child under international law.

By that stage, H had made a formal complaint to Cafcass about Ms McKay.  That complaint was dealt with internally and a full response was sent to H by Mr Mike Lisser who had overall responsibility for the Customer Services Team.  In her email to H, Ms McKay explained that a decision had been taken to await the outcome of that complaint (which involved missing the &#8216;July&#8217; round of indirect communication) before any decision was taken as to her continuing role in the case.  Mr Dent, the First Defendant, had decided in the light of the outcome of the complaint that her professional conduct did not in any way justify the reallocation of the case to a different Cafcass officer.  Once that decision had been taken, Ms McKay sent her email to H and set out in some detail the dates for the &#8216;next steps&#8217;.  She confirmed that she would meet with B following receipt of each of his letters and provide direct feedback to H and B&#8217;s mother.  She was also proposing to liaise closely with H to make suggestions as to how matters might be improved and/or moved along towards a reinstatement of direct contact.  She proposed a mid-way review on or around the beginning of December 2014 with a final review in May 2015.  That review was to inform the report she would be making to the court on the anniversary of the Family Assistance order.  She sent H some documents and information about the scheme underpinning Family Assistance Orders and offered to do her best to answer any questions he might have over the course of the next few months.</span></p>

That report was made in the context of the fresh application for a child arrangements order which H had by then made to the court.  That application had been listed before HHJ Bellamy QC for a further hearing on 5 June 2015.  The court had ordered the further report on 14 May 2015.

Ms McKay describes in her report how H had sent &#8216;entirely appropriate, child centred&#8217; letters and the like, all of which had been completed &#8216;with much care and attention&#8217;.   Sadly, B had refused to allow those letters to be read to her showing, alternatively, indifference and anger in the face of her father&#8217;s attempts to keep the relationship alive, albeit at a distance.  Ms McKay speaks in her report of B&#8217;s anxiety regarding the prospect of spending time with her father manifesting itself in &#8216;frequent tummy aches and emotional outbursts suggesting that she is genuinely upset and worried by the prospect of seeing her father&#8217;.  I can imagine how much sadness and frustration her reactions must have caused H, particularly in circumstances where he subjectively perceived B&#8217;s mother and grandmother to be the cause of the continuing estrangement between them.  He undoubtedly felt himself to be in an increasingly hopeless position as he watched his role as B&#8217;s father pushed to the margins of her life.  I can well understand that he was looking for someone to blame in circumstances where, as he saw it, the likelihood of this situation arising had been flagged up in the core assessment some two years previously.</span></p>

The absence of such an invitation amounts, on his case, to a fraud perpetrated on the court, and a deliberate fraud in which both the Second and Third Defendants were involved.

At one stage of the recorded exchanges outside court, Ms Harman commented that she had advised her client (B&#8217;s mother) to ask H to provide an independent report for the English court in order to inform the court as to the legal implications of such an English order under Bulgarian law.  There appears to be an issue as to whether or not H&#8217;s former solicitor was ever asked to provide such a report.

She had no contractual relationship with H and at no time was her professional relationship with him impressed with any fiduciary or legal obligations.  She had a professional  obligation to act in the best interests of her client who, relying on the content of the Cafcass report, was unwilling to agree to an order for direct contact when such an order ran contrary to B&#8217;s clearly expressed views.  Ms Harman had an obligation not to mislead the court.  There is no evidence before me that she did so, still less that she fraudulently or knowingly practised a deliberate deception on the court.  The issue of the international report seems to me to be a bit of a red herring.  H consented to the order made on 23 June 2014.  I have no evidence before me which persuades me that his will was overborne on that occasion to the extent that he was unable to voice any concerns to the court had he wished to express them at that stage.  It is a fact of life these days in family courts up and down the country that more and more parents find themselves advocating their own cases as litigants in person.  He sought legal advice after that hearing but took no steps to bring the matter back to court.</span></p>

First, the clear requirements of r 37.10(3)(a) must be adhered to.  Since the criminal standard of proof applies to committal applications, the application notice which triggers the proceedings is the equivalent of an indictment in a criminal trial.  Since the liberty of the defendant is potentially at stake, it is imperative (and an overriding requirement of any such application) that he or she knows precisely how the case against them is pleaded.  Secondly, a line of distinction is drawn between the application itself (r 37.10(3)(a)) and the evidence in support of the application (r 37.10(3)(b)).</span></p>

Far from setting out in full the grounds on which each application against each Defendant is made with specific details of the alleged act or acts of contempt and the dates upon which they are said to have been committed, there is no specific information at all save for a series of very general allegations.  I take the view that the notices as they stand would not provide any of these Defendants with the full particulars to which they are properly entitled.  Serious allegations have been put before the court and H invites me to impose upon each a sentence of imprisonment which would have far-reaching and potentially devastating consequences in respect of their professional careers and livelihoods, quite apart from the deprivation of their personal liberty.  Each has a right to know the case which is put against him or her.</span></p>

In my judgment, they are not cured by travelling to the content of his two affidavits, still less the written submissions which he has appended to his skeleton argument.  By and large, his affidavits set out the chronological sequence of events which have occurred during the course of the litigation in the Family Court thus far.  Interwoven into the fabric of the affidavits are some serious allegations of lying to the court, demonstrating bias, and flagrantly breaching court orders.  As I said during the course of argument, it seemed to me that many of these allegations arise directly from a failure to read with any care the two orders from which the alleged breaches are said to flow.  As Mr Graham accepted, in at least one instance, he (on H&#8217;s behalf) has completely misread and misinterpreted an order which requires Cafcass to report and to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">&#8216;assess immediately interim contact between the Applicant father and his daughter&#8217; </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">as an order directing them to set up an immediate programme of face to face contact.

The judge at first instance held that although the notice itself was defective, the wife&#8217;s affidavit in support contained sufficient detail to enable the husband to understand the nature of the allegations which were being made against him.  That part of the decision was upheld on appeal in relation to allegations that the husband had constantly telephoned the wife and followed her on foot or in his car.  However, the Court of Appeal held that the judge&#8217;s finding in relation to a serious assault which he found the husband to have perpetrated against the wife should not have been taken into account since no mention of it had appeared in the committal application.  Nicholls LJ, who gave the leading judgment, set out the test to be applied in the context of a defective committal application.  At page 1683, his lordship said this :-</span></p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">&#8216;So the test is, does the notice give the person alleged to be in contempt enough information to enable him to meet the charge ?  In satisfying this test it is clear that in a suitable case if lengthy particulars are needed, they may be included in a schedule or other addendum either at the foot of the notice or attached to the notice so as to form part of the notice rather than being set out in the body of the notice itself.  But a reference in the notice to a wholly separate document for particulars that ought to be in the notice seems to me to be quite a different matter.  I do not see how such a reference can cure what otherwise would be a deficiency in the notice.  As I read the Rules and as I understand the decision in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Chiltern District Council v Keane</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">, the Rules require that the notice itself must contain certain basic information.  That information is required to be available to the respondent to the application from within the four corners of the notice itself.  From the notice itself the person alleged to be in contempt should know with sufficient particularity what are the breaches alleged.  A fortiori, in my view, where the document referred to is an affidavit, which does not set out particulars in an itemised form, but which leaves the respondent to the committal application to extract and cull for himself from an historical narrative in the affidavit relevant dates and times and so forth, and to work out for himself the precise number of breaches being alleged and the occasions on which they took place.&#8217;</span></p>

It is clear (and is accepted, now, by H) that Mr Dent was not in breach of either order.  If there was any technical breach of paragraph 1 of the November 2013 order, that breach was Miss Patterson&#8217;s in that her report was filed five days late.  She filed a full report which was focused precisely upon the issues which she had been directed to address.  The hearing on 25 February 2014 was an effective hearing and, in any event, she is not included within the ambit of the three committal applications.  When I raised this with Mr Graham towards the end of his submissions on behalf of H, he said to me (perhaps tellingly), &#8220;We are not going for Nicola Patterson&#8221;.</span></p>

In my judgment a necessary application of the principle is that an order is not enforceable as an injunction unless it is directly and specifically addressed to the person or persons, or to the group or class of persons, who are intended to be bound by it.  Those intended to be bound by an injunction must be clearly and unambiguously identified in the order.  An injunction which fails that test &#8230; is unenforceable by committal.

I have already ruled, and it is accepted on behalf of H, that (i) this document is not evidence, but submission; and (ii) it cannot remedy the procedural defects in the committal application notice.  Nevertheless, I propose to deal with the gist of these complaints if not the substance (there is no evidence to substantiate them) if only to dispose fully of these applications.   For these purposes, I refer to the chronological background of her involvement in the case as I have set it out in paragraphs 23 to 31 of my judgment.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">It was nothing of the sort and, again, to my mind demonstrates a further misunderstanding of the nature of the processes undertaken daily by those charged with exercising a judicial function within the Family Court as it sits at one level or another up and down the land on a daily basis.  First, this was a consent order.  As I have already said, had H felt that his agreement had been obtained as a result of undue pressure or duress (which I do not accept having listened to the illicitly obtained tape recordings of the exchanges which took place outside court), his remedy does not lie in committal applications against any of these Defendants but by way of an application to set aside the consent order.  Secondly, the Family Court is not a rubber stamp whether it is exercising its jurisdiction in relation to children or financial proceedings.  The role of the Cafcass officer is to report to the court and to make recommendations on the basis of the enquiries and investigations carried out &#8216;on the ground&#8217; on behalf of the court.  Even in circumstances where parties put before the court an agreement or consent order, no judge or lay bench is obliged to make the order without more.  The welfare of the particular child will always be the court&#8217;s paramount consideration in accordance with the welfare checklist in paragraph 1(3) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  The overriding objective set out in Part 1 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 may mean that a court does not have to embark upon a full forensic investigation of each case where there is, or appears to be, a consensus as to the way forward.   But it is difficult to imagine circumstances where a professional lay bench or a judge sitting in a Family Court would be prepared to sanction any order which it, he or she believed to be contrary to the best interests of a child simply because an invitation to do so was extended by the parties.</span></p>

Much of that material was not available to the Defendants or their legal representatives until it was served on the morning of the hearing (or at best during the 24 hours before).  In my judgment it is absolutely no answer to these glaring deficiencies for Mr Graham to point to the fact, as he does, that the Defendants are all intelligent professionals who should be deemed to understand the nature of the case advanced against them.  That, it seems to me, is yet another failure on his part to understand the nature of these legal processes and the clear procedural rules which exist to ensure that those who find themselves on the receiving end of such potentially punitive outcomes receive an entirely fair and transparent hearing.  That hearing can only proceed from the outset if there is against each of these Defendants a clear statement of the allegations made against them.   </span></p>

There is an obvious need to guard carefully against the risk of allowing vindictive litigants to use such proceedings to harass persons against whom they have a grievance, whether justified or not, and although the rules do not prescribe the class of persons who may bring proceedings of this kind, the court will normally wish to be satisfied that the applicant was liable to be directly affected by the making of the statement in question before granting permission to bring proceedings in respect of it.  Usually the applicant will be a party to the proceedings in which the statement was made, but I would not exclude the possibility that permission might be granted to someone other than a party if he was, or was liable to be, directly affected by it.  In my view there is also a danger of reducing the usefulness of proceedings for contempt if they are pursued where the case is weak or the contempt, if proved, trivial.

That document is littered with allegations of maladministration (&#8216;allowing questionable reports to go through unchecked&#8217;; failing to check that a FAO was a reasonable outcome; criticising the Second Defendant for filing her report late notwithstanding an acceptance by Mr Yalland that she could not be criticised for the fact that she was only allocated to the case on 21 March 2014; accusing the Second Defendant of &#8216;railroading&#8217; a solution which involved the granting of a FAO approved independently by the court; &#8216;failing to remedy the omission over the course of 12 months; failing to engage with the FAO; failing to elevate the matter to a higher court on grounds, inter alia, of &#8216;mental health issues&#8217;; and numerous (unparticularised) allegations of &#8216;lies, threat(s), deception of a foreign LIP and tarnishing the reputation of another solicitor&#8217;; &#8216;misleading the magistrates in court&#8217;.</span></p>
	      </authorialNote><span style="font-family:Garamond">.  I take into account the very considerable delay which has occurred in bringing these proceedings.  Mr Graham sought to persuade me that H had his eye &#8216;taken off the ball&#8217; as a result of the other avenues he was pursuing against these Defendants (such as the internal complaints procedure he invoked within Cafcass, the complaint to the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the investigation which followed that complaint).  I cannot ignore the fact that he has still failed to provide any credible explanation for the nine month delay before deciding to issue his committal applications.  He has filed three committal applications which he accepts are wholly defective in terms of the procedural requirements of FPR 2010.  He admits that his case against the First Defendant has no legal merit whatsoever.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr Yalland made his final submissions on H&#8217;s behalf in relation to the permission gateway insofar as it concerned allegations of interfering with the course of justice.  If I may say so, he did so with courtesy and a surprising degree of insight into the very obvious deficiencies in H&#8217;s case as they had emerged up to that point.  He told me that H does not seek to punish the individuals involved in these proceedings; rather he seeks justice in the wider interest of the public at large.  He submitted that Cafcass had been set up in such a way as to be immune from any culpability for delays and mistakes (a submission I am unable to accept).  He said that it was indeed in the wider public interest, despite the acknowledged procedural irregularities in the applications, for the proceedings to move to the next stage of forensic investigation in order that I might conduct some form of wider ranging enquiry into whether or not a contempt of court had been established.  He justified the existence of that public interest by reference to the inability, refusal or unwillingness of the Second and Third Defendants to obey court orders in a timely manner.  Their inaction, he contended, had led to injustice to B and H.  Their maladministration, he submitted, may well be the result of being under-resourced, under-staffed and/or the result of the imposition of tasks which were impossible to perform.  These, he submitted, were issues for resolution by politicians.  They should not deter me from allowing the applications to proceed to a full judicial determination.</span></p>
