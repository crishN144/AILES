	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In summary the preliminary issue raised by the father arises from the fact that, following a full assessment, there is unanimity between all the parties to the effect that neither a care order nor a supervision order is required in this case. There is agreement that &#8216;B&#8217; shall continue to live with his mother and &#8216;K&#8217; under a residence order and that the father&#8217;s contact shall remain limited to once per week on a Saturday provided that it is supervised by various approved family members. Whilst the father has conceded that he may have accidentally caused the fracture to &#8216;B&#8217;s right arm, he does not concede the threshold criteria and makes no admissions about the cause of &#8216;B&#8217;s respiratory collapse or, if that collapse was inflicted, its perpetrator. The local authority, mother and children&#8217;s guardian, despite there being agreement as to the orders that are to be made, seek findings of fact against the father with respect to the arm fracture and respiratory collapse. The father claims:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Baron J directed that the preliminary issue be considered by the trial judge at 2.00pm on the first day of the hearing. Due to an administrative error, only counsel for the father attended before me, as the trial judge, at the appointed time on the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July. All the parties, however, attended at 10.30 on Tuesday 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July when full argument was heard on the issues raised by the father. At the conclusion of the argument I reserved judgment. In view of the time constraints, and in view of the benefit (if possible) in having a written record of the judgment on this issue, I do not propose to do more than summarise the arguments raised by both sides on this important and apparently novel issue. This course is in no way intended to show disrespect for the full and clear written arguments produced by each party which were supplemented by thoughtful and relevant oral submissions. I hope that it goes without saying that I am extremely grateful to the advocates for the skill that they have each deployed in presenting their cases.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before turning to the legal arguments that have been raised, it is helpful to consider the reality of the father&#8217;s position in these proceedings. His formal &#8216;Response to Threshold Findings&#8217; dated 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2005 <span style="font-weight:bold">[prelim pages of bundle page 109]</span> asserts that the fracture to &#8216;B&#8217;s arm may have occurred on the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2004 at bath time when &#8216;B&#8217; wriggled free of the father&#8217;s grasp and the father grabbed his arm to stop him falling. The father does not accept that this concession is sufficient to cross the s 31 threshold. He goes on to deny any attempt to smother or otherwise harm &#8216;B&#8217; on the day of his collapse or at any other time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father&#8217;s stated position in relation to &#8216;B&#8217;, coupled with the earlier findings and risk assessment with regard to &#8216;K&#8217;, would not normally support the imposition upon him of a regime of restricted supervised contact for the indefinite future, yet he is content to accept just such a regime in this case. Following questions from the court, Mr Tolson explained the father&#8217;s position in this way: </p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;He puts up with this contact arrangement because he has a horror of being found guilty of an offence he did not commit [ie the alleged assault leading to &#8216;B&#8217;s collapse] leading to a possible prison sentence and to putting his relationship with his children in jeopardy.&#8221; </p>

		</level>
	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.11in">   It is, says Mr Tolson, a pragmatic position.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is, therefore, in reality, a very wide gulf between the case of abuse asserted against the father and his denial of any culpable behaviour. This gulf is not however reflected in a similar head on clash over the arrangements for &#8216;B&#8217;s future care, solely because the father, for the &#8216;pragmatic&#8217; reasons reported by his counsel, has decided to accept greatly restricted contact arrangements in order to avoid a contested fact finding hearing.</p>

There is in my view very little difference between the requirements laid down in these two instruments, despite the passage of over 700 years between the two. That this is so is really of no surprise. Both are fundamental statements of core human rights. For the purposes of the &#8216;lawfulness&#8217; argument raised in this case, I fully accept that any process upon which this court embarks to find facts in these proceedings must be &#8220;by lawful judgment&#8221; and &#8220;by the law of the land&#8221; (per 1215) or &#8220;in accordance with the law&#8221; (per 1950).</p>

The issue of the proceedings following the apparent life threatening event (ALTE) experienced by &#8216;B&#8217; and the discovery that he had an earlier spiral fracture of the right humerus was both legitimate and proportionate and is not the subject of any challenge as to legality. The proceedings have not been withdrawn and there is no application to withdraw them. Mr Vater for the local authority explains that there is no application for withdrawal because the local authority sees the making of findings of fact as being an integral part of the proceedings, notwithstanding that the authority does not intend to seek a public law order at the end of the case. These are, he says, serious allegations; the evidence in support is strong; there is no concession from the father that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 31</ref> threshold is met and such concessions as he does make about the arm do not fit with the medical evidence. It is necessary, within the context of Art 8, from the point of view of &#8216;B&#8217;, if not from that of his parents as well, for the factual evidence to be called and tested.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the lawfulness issue, the father&#8217;s argument rests entirely upon the fact that, at this stage of the proceedings, no party is asking the court to make a care or supervision order. Mr Trueman, for the child, in his helpful and perceptive argument, from the agreed basis that the proceedings were lawful when they commenced, asked at what stage they became unlawful. Mr Tolson&#8217;s reply was that the proceedings became unlawful at the moment that the local authority decided not to press for a public law order. Mr Tolson also conceded that if the mother in this case was positively seeking these findings, then the court would not be acting unlawfully in conducting the hearing. If, therefore, as might have been the case, either the local authority&#8217;s or the guardian&#8217;s position had been in favour of a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 31</ref> order then the lawfulness point would not have been available for argument. </p>

If Mr Tolson&#8217;s argument is right the court&#8217;s jurisdiction to conduct the hearing might be determined on something akin to a whim. Moreover, a party&#8217;s position may legitimately change from time to time as more information becomes known, thus, on this argument, bringing into prospect proceedings that may become &#8216;unlawful&#8217; and then return to be &#8216;lawful&#8217; depending upon the local authority&#8217;s changing view as to the order to be sought. More seriously, the opening position adopted by each party might, once the evidence is heard, not be justified as being the proportionate position to protect a child.</p>

The implication of his submission is that, given the positions of the other parties in this case, they should be applying to withdraw the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 31</ref> application and that if that application were made it would have to be granted.

There is thus a judicial discretion and it does not therefore follow as night follows day that the courts jurisdiction to continue with the proceedings would end simply because the parties all agree that the proceedings should be withdrawn. The withdrawal provisions (and indeed the guardian system in public law itself) came into existence as a result of child care tragedies in the 1970&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s. The court&#8217;s role in such matters is not to be that of a neutered &#8216;rubber stamp&#8217; for the parties&#8217; requests.</p>

It is rightly at the core of Mr Tolson&#8217;s submissions in this case and, without overtly labouring the issue by including substantial descriptive text in this judgment, it is at the forefront of my consideration of the point. Amongst the pertinent questions are: Is there a pressing need for such a hearing? Is the proposed fact finding hearing solely, as Mr Tolson puts it, &#8216;to seek findings against the father on criminal matters for their own sake&#8217;? Is the process, which will be costly and time consuming, with potentially serious consequences for the father if it goes against him, proportionate to any identified need?</p>

His stance on the factual dispute (which is in effect to accept no culpable behaviour) is completely incompatible with his acceptance of limited, long-term, supervised contact. This, as is candidly admitted, is a &#8216;pragmatic&#8217; position to avoid the feared consequences of the proposed investigation. It is a tactical position. It is not child focussed and has no internal logic. The apparent unanimity of view about the final orders hides the reality of a very substantial and important factual dispute between the father and the other parties.</p>

Such a hearing is in &#8216;B&#8217;s best interests. In particular I regard it as almost inevitable that there will be a request for more open contact by the father in the future. I see his current tactical position as being temporary and opportunistic.

The decision that I have reached on this preliminary issue has been approached on the basis of the arguments and the principles to which I have referred. I approach the fact finding process with an open mind and the fact that I have decided against the father&#8217;s submissions is in no manner an indication of any view of the merits of the case. I have no such view at present and cannot have one until I have fully digested the written material and heard the oral evidence. Whilst I have made observations about the father&#8217;s tactical position within the context of the legal argument and the merits of the preliminary issue as a whole, looked at narrowly and in human terms I regard his position as readily understandable and irrelevant to any decision on the factual issue which is yet to be determined.</p>
