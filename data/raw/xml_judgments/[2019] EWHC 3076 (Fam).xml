They are: Q, who is aged 17; A, who is aged 12; B, who is aged nine; and C, who is aged seven.  A, B and C are the subjects of interim care orders to A.  Until her 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday, in March of this year, Q was also the subject of an interim care order.  In my judgment entitled, <span style="font-style:italic">Re Q (Interim Care Order: Jurisdiction)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2019/512" uk:canonical="[2019] EWHC 512 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWHC 512 (Fam)</ref>, I determined that there was no jurisdiction to make an interim public law order or, indeed, a final order of that sort, once a young person had reached the age of 17; this is, therefore, the reason why Q is no longer subject to an interim care order. </p>

The family had been on holiday to Turkey, and on their return to Gatwick airport in early August, had been subjected to a search, pursuant to the powers contained in Schedule 7 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/11" uk:canonical="2000 c. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Terrorism Act 2000</ref>.

Notwithstanding this material, the Local Authority&#8217;s assessment concluded that the children were not at risk of significant harm and recommended the intervention of the Prevent Programme.

In consequence, the four younger children were made the subject of police protection orders and were placed in foster care.  Following another search of the family home, the adults I have identified were arrested and then bailed. </p>

The four younger children remain at home to date, and the police investigation is ongoing.  I have been told that, presently, the Crown Prosecution Service is not of the view that the material in the possession of the police crosses the threshold test for prosecution of either parent or, indeed, Y.  I should say that Z is not the subject of an ongoing police investigation as I understand and no findings are sought against her by the Local Authority at this stage, or indeed, at all. </p>

First, the mother is a strong, if not, fanatical sympathiser of terrorism, and with the use of murder and violence in the support of the aims of the so-called Islamic State.  This is evidenced by, for example, her expressions of sympathy for terrorist acts; her watching of violent and extreme videos; her derogatory remarks about &#8216;Kuffars&#8217;, a term used to describe non-Muslims; material on her phone supportive of so-called Islamic state; and finally, of her desire to travel Syria, Mali, or the Yemen, or other war zones. </p>

The Channel Assessment Framework involves three dimensions; engagement, intent and capability, and identifies factors within each dimension which <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">may</span> (my emphasis) indicate that a person is either committed to terrorism or may become a terrorist. </p>

There is some material in the assessment suggestive that one or two of the children aged under 18 had adopted some of the modes of thinking identified as vulnerability factors in the Channel Vunerability Framework.  The assessment also raised concerns about the family&#8217;s isolation and lack of integration into the wider community, which was compounded by the children&#8217;s education within an Islamic faith school. </p>

The plan provides for the children to live with their parents, but that place is within the care of adults and in a family environment, where they continue to be at risk of significant emotional and developmental harm, by reason of their parent&#8217;s radicalised beliefs.  Further, the agreed threshold criteria make plain the parents&#8217; support for the radicalised beliefs, apparently adopted by Y, who also continues to live in the family home.  The mitigation of risk cannot be met, in my view, by the making of supervision orders, which lack powers for the Local Authority to regulate and determine, in consultation with the parents, the extent to which the parents may meet their parental responsibility of the children. </p>
