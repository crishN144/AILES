At that hearing both parties appeared as litigants in person.  The final hearing could not conclude within the 3 days allocated; it went part-heard to a further day.  I had hoped to deliver judgment on the final day of this case, but I took the view that the parties&#8217; required a written judgment not least because wife, for reasons set out below, did not attend Court on the final day. There is also the prospect of further litigation of the issues that have been considered in these proceedings. Wife has just issued an application pursuant to Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> against husband and it will be important for any judge hearing that application to be aware of what has occurred in these proceedings.  There is also the possibility that this case may return on an application for enforcement. </span></p>

Wife only instructed her solicitors the week before the trial, and Ms Rowe was only instructed on the Thursday the week before the trial was due to start on the Tuesday.  Mr Mendes Da Costa was not aware that the wife was represented until he was at Court for the start of the hearing.  The husband either had not received, or not realised he had received, a notice of acting.  Ms Rowe prepared written submissions on behalf of wife, but just before the case returned to Court in October 2023 the Court received notice that wife&#8217;s legal team had come off the record and wife would therefore appear as a litigant in person.</span></p>

Recorder Cowton KC&#8217;s order specified the content of the bundles, and they were directed to be a maximum of 500 pages.  Acting as a litigant-in-person husband had served a bundle index on the wife, wife then wanted considerable further documentation added to it.  Husband added some but not all the documentation that wife wanted, and then filed that bundle with the Court, and served it on wife.  That bundle is 1130 pages.  When wife instructed her legal team, she gave them a bundle she had prepared using her amended index, as opposed to the one the husband had prepared, so on the first day it became apparent the legal teams had prepared the case using two totally different bundles.  Due to the issues with the bundles, and uncertainty as to whether everyone had access to the same documents, the case was stood out at around midday on the first day to allow liaison between the advocates.   The hope had been that the advocates would, in the remainder of the time available on the first day, be able identify and prune the evidence to a bundle that was manageable.  The advocates were invited to co-operate with producing a Schedule of Issues, and to produce a further ES2 (the parties as litigants-in-person had produced an ES2 but it was not done in the same way that representatives would do so).</span></p>

In a different case, the matter would probably have been further stood back, or adjourned completely, for the legal representatives to prepare a bundle compliant with the earlier order.  Indeed, on the second day, there was an application on behalf of wife to adjourn.  However, I declined to adjourn the case given that this is a case where there is only limited resources and significant need; it just would not have been proportionate.  Moreover, wife&#8217;s fear about whether all the documents she served were within the bundles, were in part caused by her own actions of instructing a legal team only a few working days before trial.  When wife gave evidence, during cross-examination, she said that she had sent various documents to husband which she said verified what she was saying.  The case was paused and upon further investigation it was clear that wife had sent emails asking for various bank statements to be filed.  Those statements are now in wife&#8217;s supplementary bundle.</span></p>

There were concerns raised as to deliberate non-disclosure from the other party, as opposed to the situation simply reflecting the confusion created by the haphazard preparation of the case.  In any event as the case could not be resolved within the three-day time estimate there was time afforded to wife&#8217;s team to check if there was any crucial document that had been missed.  I made it clear to the representatives that I would not be able to read every single word of the multiple bundles. Both parties were, however, able to refer me to the key documents that they wished to ensure that I had read.  In any event, in the course of hearing the case and preparing judgment I have in fact read much of the material, and have had the opportunity to consider the key documentation in detail.</span></p>

In short, wife says that because husband has now remarried, and that the only Form A was her own rather than husband&#8217;s that the Court has no jurisdiction to deal with the application, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/28/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 28 (3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.  Ms Rowe invited me to dismiss the case and suggested if I wanted to use the Court time available, to treat the listing as an FDR in respect of a future <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/47" uk:canonical="1996 c. 47" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996</ref> claim made by husband.  I refused that application and made it clear that although an argument as to jurisdiction was being advanced &#8211; which would usually lead to the argument being determined before the case was heard &#8211; the Court was not prepared to have Mr Mendes Da Costa bounced into legal argument that he was not forewarned about, and therefore was not in a position to respond to.  As a matter of natural justice, it would be unfair of the Court to expect him to respond without time to read the authorities and do his own research.  Wife&#8217;s application for the case to be dismissed is therefore considered as part of this final judgment.</span></p>

She said that she had not been able to communicate earlier as she had not been able to access her telephone which was with the medical staff.  She was asked for evidence to be provided and she sent what looked like the top of an official record saying, &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Ambulatory Care Unit, Area B, Outpatients Department&#8217;</span><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#000000">.  There was nothing written on it from staff to confirm that wife was in the Department, or that she required immediate treatment.  Wife was informed that the Court did not accept this as evidence that required the case to be stopped, and that wife could attend via the telephone, or provide evidence from a medic that she was unable to attend.  Wife then sent a photo of an arm with gauze on it saying it was her arm, and it was evidence she was in hospital.  It certainly did appear to be an arm of someone who had received an injection, or had blood taken, but there was nothing to show that it was wife, or that it had to happen right then.  Thereafter, wife sent photos of herself in a hospital gown, lying on a hospital bed, they were dated 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;color:#000000">th</span><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> October, so at that point it did look like wife was indeed in hospital.  Wife consented to those photographs being disclosed, but instead I have described them to husband and his representative who have agreed it is not necessary for them to view them.  The photographs and emails were treated as an application to adjourn, but I declined to adjourn because they were not evidence to verify wife had to be having treatment rather than attending Court. </span></p>

She had a 12-hour history of chest pain.  The ECG, CXR and bloods were reassuringly normal.  She appears to have been discharged at 13:47 with pain relief and a plan to speak to her GP about stress.   I accept this as evidence that wife was in hospital at the time of the hearing, however it is not evidence from a medical professional that she had to be there rather than Court today.

The decree absolute is dated 12.04.2011 (but husband was not aware of it at the time).  The relevance of the date of separation in this case is because of the purchase of the rental property &#8211; which wife says occurred after separation, and husband says was during the marriage.  Recorder Allen QC said that he preferred the husband&#8217;s evidence where it was in conflict to the wife&#8217;s evidence, although he did not specifically deal with the date of separation.</span></p>

In that authority, it is clear, that a party has the capacity to seek a transfer of property order against themselves. In support of that proposition, is the fact that the Court makes such orders all the time.   The Court often finds itself making orders that transfer assets away from the applicant, or indeed making orders against their income in favour of the respondent.  </span></p>

I am driven to the conclusion that the wife has tampered with the bank statement to support the case she advanced that she had received the money from her mother.  That is, in my view, the only proper conclusion to be drawn, and is a conclusion which I am able to reach despite approaching her credibility with a clean sheet.  I am fortified in my conclusions by the changes the wife made to her Form E, and, to a lesser extent, that it appears unlikely that her mother (who has worked on and off as a machinist) would have been able to raise this sum of money, and would then have lent it to one of her children and excluded the others.  I find as a fact that these loans do not exist, and the sums paid for the deposit and the staircasing were paid from wife&#8217;s resources.</span></p>

She puts that as a total of &#163;49,905; the figure is not broken down on the ES2.  Husband does not accept any of these sums as outstanding liabilities and says that wife should be treated as having no debts.  I have found this blanket approach from both parties unhelpful, as it has left me to pick through the various statements whilst writing this judgment.   During the hearing, it was suggested to wife that she had changed the name on a water bill, as the font for her name looks different to the rest of the font used.  I made an order against the water company to forward another copy of the bill.  The water company did not respond to the order, and I considered it disproportionate to pursue that issue to another hearing.  Whilst picking through all the various bills to consider how the sum of &#163;49,905 was reached, as part of writing this judgment, I began to worry that on several of the other bills the fonts look different in places.  On the N finance bill, the Barclays arrears notice, and the HMCTS claim, they all look like the name is in a different font to the rest of the bill.  Had this been identified to me during the trial I would have made orders to access original copies of all these documents.  It would not be fair for me to exclude these liabilities now without wife having the opportunity to give evidence, and it is just not proportionate for me to make disclosure orders and delay this case further.   Therefore, I have included the wife&#8217;s figure for her liabilities on the ES2, but with real hesitation about the veracity of a lot of these liabilities, which would all have to be investigated further if this case was ever to return to Court;</span></p>

Husband is a driver; he estimates his earning capacity is &#163;18,000 per annum.  I find he may have capacity for slightly more, but his current income is supplemented by housing benefits of &#163;240 every other week which is means tested.

The secondary argument made by wife is that she says she has almost entirely repaid the mortgage and improved the family home herself, and that the rental property is non-matrimonial property.  The parties moved into the family home together.  The initial purchase in 2006 was as a shared ownership property.  There is no dispute that it was purchased in joint names with a joint mortgage from Santander, and a deposit from L&amp;Q in return for 25% ownership.  Wife says there was a declaration of trust, in respect of the property that husband had 20% and wife had  80%.  Husband denies that there was a declaration of trust, and Recorder Allen QC commented that seems to be no obvious reason why it would be held in that way, given how the purchase was funded.  In 2009, the property was &#8216;staircased&#8217; to a 100% outright ownership to husband and wife in return for a payment of &#163;50,000.  Wife says that husband had nothing to do with staircasing the property.  Husband says the only reason that wife could afford to raise the &#163;50,000 at that time was because of his financial contribution to the family.</span></p>

If wife had not fraudulently signed the documents, it would still be in joint names.  The property was bought in the marriage, and husband was paying the mortgage at times.  Wife says thereafter she has paid the mortgage and invested various sums like the cost of the new kitchen, she says husband should not have the benefit of those investments and the increase in property price caused by the delay.  However, I come back to the fact that the substantial part of the delay was caused by wife&#8217;s fraudulent actions.  Had the Court been allowed the opportunity to properly determine this case in 2011 when wife submitted her Form A, she would have had the benefit of her efforts and investment thereafter. </span></p>

Husband&#8217;s case was that the wife and the children have been living at wife&#8217;s mother&#8217;s property until some point earlier this year, when he accepts that they moved back into the family home but says that was done for litigation advantage.  Wife&#8217;s case was that she and the children have lived in the family home since the day it was purchased, save for the short period when husband occupied it alone.  I do not consider it necessary to go into the detail of where wife and the children have lived over the years to determine this case.

Husband says it is matrimonial property because wife was able to save the money for the deposit whilst they were in a relationship and sharing costs, including husband paying the mortgage on the family home.  Given I have already found that the funds for the deposit, and the staircasing of the family home have come from wife&#8217;s own resources (and not her mother&#8217;s) there is some weight to husband&#8217;s argument but there is nuance to the situation.  I recognise it was bought just before the end of the marriage, that husband did not know anything about it, and wife has maintained the property throughout.   Wife has clearly struggled to maintain these two properties and their mortgages, at times, since separation especially over the last two years.</span></p>

Husband would need &#163;350,000 to purchase a house and he has no mortgage capacity.  I do not accept that he would move to a cheaper area of the country and would be able to purchase a property for the sum he wants to receive.  If there is such a place in England, it is not clear that husband would be able to generate the same sums as a driver of elite cars.  The husband has a pressing number of debts.  The wife says that these debts must be considered as non-matrimonial liabilities, as they are created after the marriage, and therefore should not be considered as needs in this case.  The difficulty with that analysis in this case, is that it is the wife&#8217;s acts that have kept husband from having his share.  It is impossible for the Court to analyse whether husband would have less liabilities if he had received his share and been able to move on after the Form A was filed in 2011. </span></p>

The facts have been appropriately pleaded, and I have dealt with the findings about them above.  I am clear that this extreme set of facts with the wife repeatedly trying to mislead the Court meets the high test of conduct that would be inequitable to disregard.  The Court must consider what financial detriment has flowed from these acts. Undoubtedly the level of costs has been caused by wife&#8217;s acts, which I will address below.  I also find that there will have been other financial loss to the husband, but it is now impossible to quantify. The wife says the equity in the family home has increased over this time, as she has paid the mortgage, and made improvements so the value of the property has increased.  Wife says that the Court should use earlier valuations, or the valuations at the time of the hearing in front of Recorder Allen QC, to stop husband having that benefit.  However, the Court uses valuations at the date of trial and I see no reason to depart from that when all the delay flows from wife&#8217;s original acts.  Nor am I not going to permit any deductions for capital repayments to the mortgage, or take into account sums to repay investments made by wife given the circumstances.

There is an exhibit in the bundle that evidences that she lost her job because of the complaint.  The husband says he does not believe this evidence and does not believe she lost her job because of his actions.  I find that a surprising defence given his very intention when disclosing the judgment was for wife to lose her job, or her certification to practice - he achieved what he set out to do.  I find that the husband disclosed the judgments as a vengeful act.  The wife had humiliated him and disgraced him in his view, so he did the same to her. </span></p>

I find that conduct is inequitable to disregard. The two things that reduce the severity of his conduct to my mind is that all this flows from the wife&#8217;s conduct in the first place, and husband took these vengeful steps in the context of suffering his own financial hardship caused by the wife&#8217;s conduct.  The question then is what financial loss flows from this conduct.  Wife lost her job and then had a period of unemployment.  The evidence is that she has had two temporary contracts since then.  When she gave evidence in July wife said that she was job-seeking.  Had wife attended Court in October, she could have identified precisely what income had been lost.  Without her present, nor any written evidence, I estimate a figure of &#163;10,000 loss which is just over a couple of months pay.</span></p>

Husband should be able to clear his debts and will have some funds available.  On his own evidence he would not be able to re-house on that sum, but I do not accept that would mean his award should be restricted to the sum not to impact his housing benefit.   Wife also needs housing and the ability to pay off debts. To stay in the family home and repay every pound of her debts, she would need &#163;372,405.  Whilst my award would leave her short of that sum, in my judgment she would be able to manage the remaining liability.  The figure most importantly ensures that T needs are met with wife by being able to stay in his home, and also reflects the difference in contribution from the parties. </span></p>

The husband has virtually achieved the outcome he was seeking, however because the papers in this case were put together by the parties without representatives there were no open offers in advance of the hearing.

Whilst I accept that the legal argument that the husband was debarred from pursing his case was driven by wife&#8217;s legal representatives, the position that husband should not have more than &#163;16,000 reflects the wife&#8217;s approach throughout.  Her litigation conduct by tampering with the crucial bank statement has been atrocious.  Therefore, the wife should pay a portion of the husband&#8217;s costs, and because of the extreme circumstances of the wife tampering with the bank statement, I conclude that costs should be awarded on an indemnity basis.</span></p>

This is not a run of the mill costs award made against a party who has pitched somewhat unrealistically, this is an award that reflects that wife has done her utmost, including manipulating the evidence, to ensure the husband has nothing.  The total the wife therefore has to pay the husband is &#163;203,041.  If she has kept the &#163;138,624 that she agreed to place with her solicitors, then she would have to find just shy of &#163;65,000.  If she no longer has that sum, because of her own actions, the family home will have to be sold.</span></p>
