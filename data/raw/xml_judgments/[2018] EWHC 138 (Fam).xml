	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are a number of test cases, listed before me in accordance with directions given by Peter Jackson J, as he then was, on 11 May 2017. They raise various substantive and procedural questions in relation to the interface between care proceedings brought in the Family Court pursuant to Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and the requirements of Article 5 of the Convention. Specifically, the circumstances in which Article 5 is engaged in relation to a child in the care of the local authority and, where Article 5 is engaged, what procedures are required to ensure that there is no breach of the requirements of Articles 5(2)-(4). Specifically, the questions are those set out in Annex 2 to his order. As the matter developed before me, however, the Annex was refined, it being agreed, not least in the light of <span style="font-style:italic">Re X (Court of Protection Practice) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/599" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 599" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 599</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] 1 WLR 227" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] 1 WLR 227</ref>, that I should confine my attention to the issues arising in the cases listed before me.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I shall have to elaborate some of this in due course, but, as summarised in the Table attached to this judgment, the cases relate to seven children, A, B, C, D1, D2, E and F (D1 and D2 are twins) born on various dates between 2001 and 2006 (and therefore with ages ranging from 16 to 11). In respect of each of them a final care order was made, in each case in favour of the same local authority, the dates of these orders ranging between 2010 and 2013, except for one in 2017. Each child has difficulties, summarised in the Table under the heading &#8216;Health&#8217;. Some are in foster care; others in specialist placements. All are subject to certain restrictions on their movement or liberty, summarised under the heading &#8216;Restrictions&#8217;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are three children&#8217;s guardians, SW being the guardian for A and B, DD the guardian for C, D1, D2 and E, and KN the guardian for F. Only KN acted as guardian in the care proceedings; indeed, it was because of questions which arose in the context of the care proceedings in relation to F that these test cases were listed. Perfectly properly, and most helpfully, the guardians, whilst never losing sight of the individual needs and circumstances of each child, have collaborated as far as possible, not least in instructing Ms Frances Heaton QC and Ms Kate Burnell to represent each of them. The local authority, which there is no need for me to identify, and which in the interests of the children I have decided not to name, was represented by Mr Shaun Spencer. I am very grateful to all of them, guardians and counsel alike, for their invaluable assistance in a matter which raises a number of important if teasing problems.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should record that, when the time came for the guardians to give oral evidence, I proposed, and no-one disagreed, they should all give evidence together at the same time, rather than seriatim, in a process which has now come to be referred to as &#8216;hot-tubbing&#8217;. Although most usual nowadays in the context of expert evidence &#8211; and children&#8217;s guardians are, of course, experts, even if not in the narrow sense &#8211; hot-tubbing&#8217;, at least in the family courts, is not confined to experts. An early reported example is <span style="font-style:italic">Re MM (Medical Treatment) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 FLR 224" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 FLR 224</ref>, 234G, a case in which I appeared as counsel before Black J, as she then was. A few years later I adopted the same technique in an unreported wardship case where I &#8216;hot-tubbed&#8217; the ward&#8217;s school headmaster and form-teacher.</p>

In circumstances where all the children involved were protected by the interim orders I had made, it seemed to me sensible to defer giving judgment in these cases until the Court of Appeal had given judgment in the other case. That judgment was handed down on 31 October 2017: <span style="font-style:italic">Re D (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2017/1695" uk:canonical="[2017] EWCA Civ 1695" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWCA Civ 1695</ref>.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Although it is not necessary for the decision in this case, I also agree with the President that the question whether there is &#8220;confinement&#8221; should be approached in the careful way analysed by Lord Kerr in <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West</span>, at paragraphs 77 to 79. A three year-old child must be restrained for her own safety if walking near a busy road, or playing near a bonfire. This restraint would be unlawful if exercised over an adult. But it is lawful if exercised by any adult looking after the child. In my view, there is no need for an elaborate analysis of delegated parental responsibility to explain this. In such circumstances, restraint to keep the child safe lawfully could (and normally should) be exercised by any nearby adult. The true analysis is that explained by Lord Kerr. For all present purposes, &#8220;confinement&#8221; means not simply &#8220;confining&#8221; a young child to a playpen or by closing a door, but something more: an interruption or curtailment of the freedom of action normally to be ascribed to a child of that age and understanding. In most of the myriad instances in life where children are restrained in one way or another &#8211; by being compelled unwillingly to go to school, go to bed at a given time and so forth &#8211; there can be no question of their being &#8220;confined&#8221; so as to fulfil the first limb of the test in <span style="font-style:italic">Storck</span>.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">First, the realities of the modern world, driven in significant part because the school-leaving age is now sixteen and by consequential changes in the employment patterns of young people, mean that the typical child who is not yet sixteen years old is not economically active and lives &#8211; in reality has no choice but to live &#8211; at home. So, the typical child of fifteen is, in the sense in which the expression is used in the case-law, not free to leave the place where they live. If the fifteen-year old child runs away, wanting to live on their own, they will probably not get social housing and, if not taken into care, are likely to be returned home to live either with the parents or with other relatives.</p>

The ubiquity of the motor vehicle in modern Britain, accompanied by changes in social attitudes as to what is or is not &#8216;responsible parenting&#8217;, mean that the street is no longer as safe (or seen as being as safe) an environment as it once was. It is no longer as safe (or seen as being as safe) as it once was for children to play in the street, to be allowed to roam or even to go to and from school under their own steam.</p>

Thus a teenager of the same age and familial background as MIG and MEG is the relevant comparator for them. If one compares their state with a person of similar age and full capacity it is clear that their liberty is in fact circumscribed. They may not be conscious, much less resentful, of the constraint but, objectively, limitations on their freedom are in place.</p>

If MIG and MEG had the same freedom from constraint as would any child or young person of similar age, their liberty would not be restricted, whatever their level of disability. As a matter of objective fact, however, constraints beyond those which apply to young people of full ability are &#8211; and have to be &#8211; applied to them. There is therefore a restriction of liberty in their cases. Because the restriction of liberty is &#8211; and must remain &#8211; a constant feature of their lives, the restriction amounts to a deprivation of liberty.</p>

There is no question, therefore, of suggesting that infant children are deprived of their liberty in the normal family setting. A comparator for a young child is not a fully matured adult, or even a partly mature adolescent. While they were very young, therefore, MIG and MEG's liberty was not restricted. It is because they can &#8211; and must &#8211; now be compared to children of their own age and relative maturity who are free from disability and who have access (whether they have recourse to that or not) to a range of freedoms which MIG and MEG cannot have resort to that MIG and MEG are deprived of liberty.&#8221;</p>

The evidence from the guardian, which I envisage can often be quite short, will typically focus on the &#8220;confinement&#8221; and &#8220;deprivation of liberty&#8221; issues; unless there has been a very significant change in the child&#8217;s circumstances, the application under the inherent jurisdiction should not be an occasion for re-opening the wider welfare issues previously determined in the care proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question has been raised whether a child&#8217;s competency to consent to a &#8220;confinement&#8221; can properly and fairly be assessed by a local authority social worker. Whilst I would not wish to exclude evidence on the point from a social worker who feels properly qualified to express an opinion, it is plainly undesirable that the only evidence on the point should come from an employee of the local authority responsible for the &#8220;confinement&#8221;. And one would, in any event, expect that if a child whose circumstances require a regime more restricted than that of a comparator contemporary is nonetheless said to have the capacity to give a valid consent, that proposition would normally be made good by evidence from either a child and adolescent psychologist or, depending upon the nature of the child&#8217;s difficulties, a child and adolescent psychiatrist. I recognise that in putting it this way I am departing somewhat from what Keehan J said in <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v D, E and C</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/3473" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 3473 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 3473 (Fam)</ref>, para 44.</p>

The argument against the former is that the local authority will have to pay a court issue fee for each review; the argument against the latter is that if the proceedings continue indefinitely this will cause CAFCASS significant administrative problems and the legally-aided lawyers significant problems in relation to open, rather than concluded, legal aid certificates. The consensus arrived at by the parties, with which I agree, is that, generally speaking, it is preferable for the proceedings to be concluded at the end of the final hearing and thereafter at the end of each review, rather than being kept open. The local authority&#8217;s stance was that, although there would be a cost implication for it in having to issue a fresh application for each review, the overall costs thus incurred were not significant and could properly be borne by the local authority.</p>

Limitations on movement are generally dictated by limitations in MIG&#8217;s ability, or her lack of awareness of danger. She has never sought to leave the home. If she were to try to leave she would be restrained for her own immediate safety. MIG has no sense of safety and in particular no awareness of road safety. She needs to be guided and accompanied. She needs guidance in crossing roads. This is because of her disability. Such restraints do not amount in my judgment to deprivation of liberty. She is not medicated.</p>

Those outbursts are principally directed at other residents and young persons whom she perceives as less able than herself. She has to be restrained from time to time when she has an outburst.

I have re-read my note carefully. No oral evidence was given about this medication and it&#8217;s uses at the hearing. Miss Morris has since pointed out to me that Mr O&#8217;Meara reported that the staff at B Home told him that MEG receives medication to &#8220;stabilise her mood and calm her&#8221;. She also drew my attention to Dr Xenitidis&#8217; report where he records that LG told him that the gradual but significant improvement in MEG&#8217;s behaviour was caused in his view by the &#8220;implementation of strategies in place both reactive and in terms of rewarding positive behaviour as well as identifying early warning signs of her behaviour. It is possible that tranquilising medication prescribed for her &#8216;Risperidone 1mg at night&#8217; may have helped as well.&#8221; In addition he felt that the fact that MEG has a structured day programme has &#8220;helped a lot&#8221;. The effect of the medication on MEG was not explored in any way in the hearing before me and Dr Xenitidis in particular was not asked about it in the letter of instruction or in evidence. Miss Morris tells me that the Official Solicitor takes the view that the fact that MEG is medicated means that the arrangements go beyond &#8220;ordinary restrictions&#8221; in a children's home for adolescents when taken together with the restraints which have to be exercised temporarily and from time to time when she has a tantrum. </p>

On the material before me I do not conclude that medication plays a part in restraining MEG so as to create a deprivation of her liberty. She was not medicated in order to secure her admission and is not medicated to prevent her from leaving. My reading of the evidence was that she would require this medication in any setting. There were no specific references to measures of restraint in the evidence save that in the final care plan it was stated that MEG had sometimes to be guided away from an activity which could trigger unpredictable behaviour using &#8220;MAYBO&#8221; (physical intervention programme) techniques in a way which did not involve physical restraint, although I understood from the descriptions of seriously aggressive incidents (now rare) that there might have had to be appropriate physical intervention. This physical restraint in my judgment does not amount to a deprivation of liberty. </p>
