	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns a little girl (W) born in November 2012 and who is now 2 years and 7 months old. The child was placed for adoption by Brighton and Hove City Council following public law proceedings in which she was made subject to care and placement orders in September 2013. The application before me is for an adoption order under the provisions of the Adoption and Children Act (ACA) 2002 s 46.  The application is made by Mr and Mrs A with whom W was placed 16 months prior to the hearing of this application. In December 2014 the child&#8217;s father was granted permission by the circuit judge in Brighton to oppose the making of an adoption order under s 47 (5) of ACA and it was that application which was listed before me on the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2015. However on the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of May 2015 the Court of Appeal allowed appeals by the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondent (&#8220;the father&#8221;) in this case against care and placement orders made in Brighton County Court on the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2013 in respect of his daughter W, reported as <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/583" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 583" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 583</ref>. </p>

The children are full siblings; the children of the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Respondent (&#8220;the mother&#8221;). X, Y and Z all live with their father who has a residence order in his favour, and they were made subject to year long supervision orders in September 2013 (now no longer in force). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a result of the placement order W (then 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>months old) was placed with the Applicants as prospective adopters. This placement order has been overturned by the Court of Appeal. W had been removed from her father&#8217;s care when just over 4 weeks old and placed in foster care where she remained until placed with the Applicants in January 2014. At the hearing before District Judge Gamba in September 2013 evidence was heard and a judgment given but, unfortunately the district judge failed to set out in the judgment precisely how he had found the threshold criteria pursuant to s 31 of the Children Act (CA) 1989 were met and did not begin to carry out an analysis of the options regarding W&#8217;s placement; this latter flaw was the basis of the successful appeal. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It falls to this court to decide whether the welfare of this child is best met by reunification with her birth family to be cared for by her father and to grow up with her siblings or by remaining with, and being adopted by, the Applicants under the provisions of the ACA and the welfare checklist set out in s 1 with particular reference to s 1(2) and (4). The history of W&#8217;s placement will be set out in detail below and it is of relevance not only because it forms part of the background to the case as a whole but because it will be of relevance to W herself as it is part of her individual background and will form part of her understanding of herself and her identity as she grows up and for the rest of her life. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">W was born in November 2012 the youngest of four siblings whose mother (&#8220;the mother&#8221;) suffers poor mental health for which she receives psychiatric treatment, and which, at times, makes it impossible for her to care safely for her children. In turn this affected the father and his ability to care for the children, although it must be recognised that at the times when the mother was well there have not been any concerns about the family and until 2011 there was no substantial concerns recorded by any child protection agencies; the three children were all healthy, attending school and nursery and growing up within their family. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both the mother and the father had had difficult upbringings and what was described by the local authority as &#8220;complex&#8221; childhood and family histories. The father had suffered abuse within his own family and was estranged from his mother and two elder siblings. The mother&#8217;s father did not have contact with her from an early age and her mother died when she was only 12; she lived with an elder sibling and then in foster care. The mother has had long-standing problems with her mental health since she was an adolescent; she has extensive contact with Mental Health Services since 2008. The mother has been thoroughly assessed on more than one occasion, including for the hearing which took place in September 2013. She had previously been diagnosed as suffering from a recurrent depressive disorder and treated for depression. The report contained the diagnosis of an emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) or a diagnosis of a mixed personality disorder with EUPD and Anakastic traits. As is apparent from the documents filed in this case the mother&#8217;s mental state fluctuates with marked improvement when she takes anti-depressive medication and she is not under stress. The children X, Y and Z all enjoy seeing their mother and, when she is well, they have very happy, stimulating and enjoyable contact with her. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father had a troubled childhood. He was open in describing this to the social worker who carried out a parenting assessment completed in October 2012. It is abundantly clear that that assessment by Beverley Hendry formed the basis of the local authority&#8217;s approach towards this family. I shall return to this later in this judgment as it still apparently colours their view of the father. The father&#8217;s father was a violent, abusive and controlling man; who physically and sexually abused his wife and his children. There was ineffective intervention by social services and other agencies (the children were not sent to school) and it was not until he was 16 and their neighbour intervened that the local authority took action. After his father was forced to leave the family had to move on several occasions when he attempted to find their location. To his credit the father was able to educate himself and despite inevitable gaps in his knowledge he went to college and gained GCSEs. He has been in work in the past and would like to start working in the future. </p>

The family were referred to social services by the school in 2008 in January and again in April. The father briefly left and returned to the family home in early 2011 because of the mother&#8217;s behaviour brought about by her condition which included mood swings, deliberate self harm, impulses to harm her children, difficulties controlling anger and violence towards her partner (as described by the psychiatrist who wrote a report in March 2013).</p>

She left the family home to stay with friends; she evidently has had insight into her own condition for some time. The relationship between the parents became more difficult as the mother&#8217;s mental health deteriorated during 2011. It is not necessary for me to set down everything that has been recorded, but there were several hospital admissions including for overdoses, alcohol abuse, incidents of the mother self-harming and short periods of separation. The father remained committed to the mother and to his relationship with her despite the difficulties and the increasing involvement of social services as a result of reports by him, by the mother and by the children&#8217;s school and nursery as the children had complained about their mother&#8217;s behaviour at home. In September 2011 the children were made the subjects of Child Protection Plans under the category of emotional abuse. The mother&#8217;s mental health continued to deteriorate and the father was advised by the local authority that the children should not be left in the sole care of their mother and that it would be better for the children if the couple lived separately.</p>

This continued into 2012 when the mother was also subject of detentions by the police under s138 of the Mental Health Act (MHA) 1983 and was assessed in hospital under the MHA. The school mentor contacted social services about her concerns regarding the eldest child (X). The father agreed with the local authority that the mother would only see the children on set days supervised by him. In March it was reported by a mid-wife that the mother was pregnant (with W). The parents had a written agreement that the mother would have supervised contact with the children in their home; however by July the mother returned to the family home with social services agreement. By August 2012 the father was advised, again, that he was not to allow the children to have unsupervised contact if the mother was unwell. In August 2012 the mother was again detained by the police under s136 MHA. She was evidently unwell and the children were reported as saying that they had witnessed more than one incident when their mother had assaulted their father.</p>

W was discharged following an examination as there were no concerns, apart from some excess saliva and disorientation. The children had complained at school and nursery X about feeling upset and a nick to her mouth caused when her father had helped her to brush her teeth, and Z about how he had received a minor bruise to his right ear. There were unannounced visits made by the social worker and the father was put under pressure to accept a support worker.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the spring and summer 2013 the mother&#8217;s mental health again deteriorated and she was admitted to hospital as a result of overdoses. At the same time against the backdrop of public law proceedings the father&#8217;s relationship with the social worker also deteriorated. Y had continued to display difficult behaviour at school and X to express her anxieties. A psychological assessment, dated 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2013, of all 4 children was carried out by Gail Miller; running to some 159 pages it is a comprehensive assessment which was considered by District Judge Gamba in September 2013. The crux of the local authority&#8217;s case was the emotional harm caused to the children by their mother&#8217;s ill health and the inability of the father to prioritise the children&#8217;s needs relative to the needs of the mother. Ms Miller shared the concern and saw the father as focussing on keeping the family unit together rather than seeking a safe distance from the mother both for the children and to allow her the space to recover. The father was seen as being resistant to professional or therapeutic work to support him in finding a healthier relationship with the mother and changing his priorities from partner to parent; he was not able to emotionally separate from the mother. Ms Miller describes him as lacking acceptance and understanding of the concerns of professionals and said that it meant he was denying the children&#8217;s experiences. However she refers, on several occasions, to his many skills as a parent and to the children&#8217;s strong attachment to him as their father. In her report she recommends that W should be placed at home with her father and siblings, a recommendation she described as &#8220;finely balanced&#8221;, and which she changed during her oral evidence. She ends her written report by making reference to the significant loss that W&#8217;s siblings would experience should she be placed away from the family. </p>

Despite the fact that there were no findings of physical abuse these allegations continued to be repeated by the local authority and, I repeat, their concentration on &#8220;the need for the father to change&#8221; remained a constant part of the local authority&#8217;s case and the basis for their opposition to his attempts to have W returned to his care. In September 2013 the court found that the father provided &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">very good care</span>&#8221; and was satisfied that he had separated from the mother and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">had reached a turning point recognising that he must concentrate on the care of the children to the exclusion of his relationship [with the mother].

Their view of the father seemed to remain unaltered despite the fact that he had remained separated from the mother; had been to counselling and was successfully parenting three children on his own. The evidence of Dr Willemsen, a clinical psychologist instructed to prepare a report on all four children within their current placements for the purpose of this hearing is to the contrary and I shall return to it when I come to consider the evidence before me in detail later in this judgment.</p>

Until November 2014 the father was responsible for arranging contact which was supervised by friends of the family. Direct contact was suspended in December 2014 with the local authority providing supervision from its resumption in February 2015. This contact is beneficial to the children in several ways including providing reassurance to them about her well being, providing time for the children to enjoy being with their mother, who they love and providing a continuing relationship with their mother which is important for their self-image and sense of identity.  The children are all doing well at school and they all have a positive relationship with their father. In his statement to the court the father has described each child (I shall return to this below when I consider all the evidence that was before me). </p>

Both Dr Willemsen and Mr Hatter had recommended that W remain in her foster placement on balance, and both had based their decisions, to some extent on the continuing concerns of the local authority about the father&#8217;s ability to manage the difficulties that are likely to arise should W return home because of the poor relationship between the father and the local authority. Dr Willemsen (at paragraphs 89 and 91 of his report) said that he was, in turn concerned that the relationship with the local authority <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;is such that there could not be a mutually responsive interaction which could support [the father] when looking after four children.&#8221; </span>He was worried that as a result of being unable to form a working alliance a breakdown could occur <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;which would cause further, perhaps unrecoverable trauma for [W]&#8221;</span>.</p>

In addition to the local authority&#8217;s concerns that the father is not able to work &#8220;openly&#8221; with them, and their view that he is so traumatised by his upbringing that he cannot always relate to his children on an emotional level they have expressed the view that the eldest child takes on a parenting role which is inappropriate. It is the view of this court that in his report and oral evidence Dr Willemsen, who is properly qualified to do so, dealt with all these points and more. In short, as is evidenced in full in his report, he found the father to be open with him both about his abusive upbringing and about the difficulties the father and his children had faced in the previous few years. Dr Willemsen found that the father co-operated well with the assessment both verbally and emotionally. He commented that the father may have genuine concerns about the actions taken by the local authority and that would contribute to the father&#8217;s anxiety and ability to work with the local authority (a theme I shall return to below). In his view the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">father had come a long way in that he was able to speak of his childhood and the trauma he suffered. He has looked after the three children and has worked hard to have the children develop a strong and secure attachment to him</span>&#8221;; an opinion reflected in the judgment of His Honour Judge Farquhar.</p>

He said, and I accept, that the strong attachment together with a separation from their mother had positively affected the children&#8217;s attachment to their father. Moreover as he said the children appeared resilient and that was evidence that they must have received some stable emotional care, both when the parents were together, and at present to come to where they are now. In addition he observed that the family appeared to manage in a very small flat. This represents the most objective view of the current circumstances of the father and the three older children and is the situation to which W would return. </p>

Dr Willemsen properly took into account the decision of the Court of Appeal and reviewed his recommendations as a result. It would be accurate to describe his original recommendation that W should remain with the prospective adoptive family as finely balanced. He described the distress, if not trauma that W would be likely to experience on being moved from the people with whom she had been living for a sizeable period of her short life and where it had been intended she should have her home. W had been moved three times  before she was placed with the As and, moreover, Dr Willemsen considered that the clinging behaviour exhibited by W when visited by the foster carers after she was moved was indicative of trauma and not of easily settling with the A family (as had been suggested elsewhere in the evidence before this court).  </p>

The disadvantages of W remaining with her current carers notwithstanding the excellent care she receives there concerned the child&#8217;s own perceptions as she grew of why she was not living with her family when her siblings had remained with her father; while in to short term this would have little impact <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;in the medium</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">term, when [W] will become aware of her adoption she may begin to raise questions about the reason for being adopted.

Ms Bazley QC for the father described W&#8217;s circumstances (which she not aware of at present) as being the subject of a process leading to her placement with her adopters which is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">fundamentally flawed and a miscarriage of justice&#8221;</span>. It is arguable that is so and it is probable that it in due course it would be seen as such by the child at the centre of that legal process. As Ms Bazley said in her closing submissions it has become an integral and inescapable part of W&#8217;s personal history and her lifelong reality.<span style="font-style:italic"/>When Dr Willemsen was asked what his recommendation was in the light of that reality he said that the case had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">preoccupied [him] greatly</span>&#8221; and that he continued to regard his recommendation as being &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">very finely balanced</span>&#8221;.</p>

It is very difficult to know how she will grow up. She might stay with the adopters (and a lot do ask, and some don&#8217;t) but I do think if she would ask why am I here, how can you explain that based on the decision made by the Court of Appeal. She can raise all sorts of questions &#8211; she had three siblings, she has another sibling, their son. She is part of this family, she is doing wonderfully well. I have so much respect they have made so much time available but I think that these dilemmas are very powerful. Having been told about the Court of Appeal this resonated with the preoccupation of belonging. Where does she belong? It is so important and it is this: should she stay with the adopters, should she begin to raise questions, it might be very disturbing&#8230;&#8221; </span>He continued his evidence by saying<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;What is fundamental to identity is a sense of belonging.

There is something really tragic about what&#8217;s happened and some people are going to feel very hurt. Something been set in motion and is very difficult to know how she will take all this and how early disturbances of care will play out in connection with the information of what will happen.

Again there is no evidence to support these assertions either from the school or in the assessments of Dr Willemsen and Mr Hatter, whose evidence I prefer. The continued reliance on the report of Ms Miller (which is clearly out of date) alone raises questions as the validity and substance of any view expressed by the social workers but the continued references to the father not being able to put into practice what he has learnt after engaging in parenting work at paragraph 6.20 are almost risible when considered against the evidence of Dr Willemsen and Mr Hatter. </p>

There is no evidence that they have moved on from the social work assessment carried out in October 2012 by the then social worker Ms Hendry who was criticised by the district judge. Moreover it would seem that the actions of Ms Alsop led directly to the father losing his job. The circumstances in which his employment with the B School was terminated came about because Ms Alsop raised the matter with the local authority designated officer (LADO) in an email on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015 in these terms &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the father has secured employment as a teaching assistant at B School.

This was contained in an email which set out that the significant harm threshold had been met although reporting that the orders which had been in place had lapsed. Neither &#8220;injury&#8221; had formed part of the threshold. The local authority tried to excuse the misleading, damaging and inaccurate referral as a consequence of difficulties presented by the CareFirst IT system.  I do not know whether or not the fault with that system is capable of correction. In raising the father&#8217;s employment with the LADO in February 2015, Ms Alsop had a professional obligation to ensure that balanced, accurate information was conveyed to the LADO and then to the school; she failed to carry out that obligation and in her duty to act openly.  It is likely that had the school been presented with the full story based on balanced information and given the positive view of the father&#8217;s work at the school that his employment would not have been terminated, along with the positive benefits for him and his family of him being in work.</p>

The local authority is  obliged at the very least to take positive steps to ensure that the information held by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS records) in respect of the father is now accurate and that this error is not compounded by further loss or inconvenience to the father in future. In the light of their unprofessional behaviour and their negative view of him both as a father and as a individual as expressed in their evidence there can be little wonder if the father finds it hard to trust the local authority and to work with them from time to time. It is largely their responsibility to repair their working relationship with him; the father&#8217;s measured response to the local authority gives me reason to believe that he will play his part not least as he fully understands the need to do so for the sake of all his children.</p>

This guardian has been involved in the proceedings from their outset in December 2012. I accept the submissions of counsel for the father and for the mother that it was immediately apparent from his evidence that the guardian has failed to understand the requirement for a holistic analysis of the evidence or to engage with the possibility of W returning to her family in an appropriately open minded manner. This was evident from both his reports and from his oral evidence. His explanation that the impact of <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span> and subsequent Court of Appeal cases including <span style="font-style:italic">Re R, Re G and Re S</span> had not been appreciated at the time of the final hearing in September 2013 was not acceptable.

The views of her siblings were not put before the court by the guardian at the final hearing; they should have been.

He very clearly loves all his children, including W and is devoted to them. I found him to be remarkably forgiving and understanding of social services, which gives me cause to believe he would work positively with them in the future (providing they are working with him). He was realistic about the difficulties that he would encounter should W return home speaking of when the excitement is over for the older children and the need to devote extra time with her. He explained how he had experience of doing this in respect of Z, the youngest child at home, and how he has been able to get the elder two to accept the need for the unequal division of his time.</p>

He reject the local authority&#8217;s claim that she was being made to take up responsibility for parenting the younger two to make up for deficits in his parenting; in this he was supported by the independent evidence of both Dr Willemsen and Mr Hatter. He said he would never allow the role of parent and child to be reversed particularly if W were to return. I accept his evidence. X is supported emotionally both at home and at school as are the other two. Y is in year 3 at school is doing well and his behaviour has improved both at home and at school. Z is in year 1, his father describes him as a wonderful, cheerful little boy; well-behaved at school and popular with his peers.

He reminded the court that he and her siblings had had excellent contact with W (which is not disputed) and it is the view of this court that it likely that she will have some residual memories of her family from that time. In his statement the father went on to remind the court that he had demonstrated his parenting skills since the hearing in 2013 (as supported by the expert evidence I have already alluded to) and said that he was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;completely committed to all of his children and love them unconditionally.&#8221;</span> I entirely accept his evidence in respect of his devotion to his children and that this devotion extends to W.</p>

I remain aware that it was the effects of that illness that had led to the local authority&#8217;s involvement and care proceedings in 2012. The father and the mother have remained separated and he has quite evidently put his children before his relationship with the mother. In turn she has taken herself away from the family and only sees the children when she is well and able to do so. By these actions both parents have put their children first. The relationship between the father and the mother had come to an end before the hearing in September 2013 and it is not an issue before this court. W would not be likely to suffer any harm as a result of her mother&#8217;s mental ill health as the mother only has contact with the children when she is well. She proposed that any contact with W after reunification would be once she is settled and it is safe for her to spend time with her mother along with her siblings.  </p>

This is in part to protect their privacy but it is also as there is no dispute or argument about the very high standard of care they have provided for W who is now part of their family and who they had intended should remain with them throughout her life as their child. Through no fault of their own they have been placed in an unexpected, distressing and difficult position. They have been forced to take a stand against W being reunited with her family and it is clear that they were unprepared for dealing with such an eventuality. Mrs A told me that should W be reunited with her family she was not sure that she could visit her or see her and could not undertake the transition they had had with the foster carers as they did not think they could handle their own emotions. While that stance is entirely understandable it is indicative of their limitations in putting the child&#8217;s interests before their own. They were not able to tell me, except in the vaguest terms, how or when they would explain to W how she came to be in their care. They had not, in any practical sense, planned for what they would tell the child or for her reacting negatively to what she is told or finds out; the latter being more problematic particularly if what she is told by her adoptive parents does not coincide with whatever she uncovers.</p>

This is an indication of how quickly children become conversant with the internet and it was clear to me from their evidence that Mr and Mrs A had little realisation of the limits of their control as the child grew of her own ability to contact her siblings or other members of her family. They had not considered how they would explain to her their role in these proceedings which would, undoubtedly be seen as their resistance not only to reunification but to contact with her siblings and original parents as she grew up. They are not prepared for future disaffection and their resistance to post adoption sibling contact indicates that they need W to be exclusively a member of their family despite her need to develop a healthy and open sense of own reality and identity. None of this is said by way of criticism rather it is a reflection of the increased likelihood of a breakdown of this placement in the future as referred to by Mr Hatter. As I am charged with W&#8217;s welfare throughout her life it is something which I must consider and keep in mind.</p>

The local authority did not seek any public law order at the conclusion of this hearing and the decision for this court is as between a child arrangements order in favour of the father or an adoption order in favour of Mr and Mrs A. Though the local authority does not seek an order the threshold remains as found by the district judge in his judgment dated 19 September 2013 which has not been the subject of challenge. The father relied, in his appeal, on a lack of proportionality in the plan for the adoption in light of the threshold found at the time (and which I have set out above) and did not challenge the finding of threshold as at the relevant time, in December 2012. </p>

It follows inexorably from that, that society must be willing to tolerate very diverse standards of parenting and very unequal circumstances flowing from it. It means that some children will experience disadvantage and harm, while others flourish in atmospheres of loving security and emotional stability. These are consequences of our fallible humanity and it is not the provenance of the state to spare children all the consequences of defective parenting.

Norway, 7 August 1996, &#167; 78, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III; Kearns v.&#160;France, no. 35991/04, &#167; 79, 10 January 2008; and R. and H., cited above, &#167;&#167; 73 and 81).&#160; In identifying the child&#8217;s best interests in a particular case, two considerations must be borne in mind: first, it is in the child&#8217;s best interests that his ties with his family be maintained except in cases where the family has proved particularly unfit; and second, it is in the child&#8217;s best interests to ensure his development in a safe and secure environment (see&#160;</span><span class="ju-005fpara-002cleft-002cfirst-0020line-003a-0020-00200-0020cm--char" style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Neulinger and Shuruk</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">, cited above, &#167;&#160;136; and R. and H., cited above, &#167;&#167;&#160;73-74). It is clear from the foregoing that family ties may only be severed in very exceptional circumstances and that everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, where appropriate, to &#8220;rebuild&#8221; the family (see </span><span class="ju-005fpara-002cleft-002cfirst-0020line-003a-0020-00200-0020cm--char" style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Neulinger and Shuruk, cited above, &#167;&#160;136; and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">R. and H., cited above, &#167; 73</span><span class="ju-005fpara-002cleft-002cfirst-0020line-003a-0020-00200-0020cm--char" style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">)</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">. It is not enough to show that a child could be placed in a more beneficial environment for his upbringing (see K and T., cited above, &#167; 173; and T.S. and D.S., cited above). However, where the maintenance of family ties would harm the child&#8217;s health and development, a parent is not entitled under Article 8 to insist that such ties be maintained (see Neulinger and Shuruk, cited above, &#167; 136; and R. and H., cited above, &#167; 73).</span></p>

However, it observes that the considerations listed in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> (see paragraph 103 above) broadly reflect the various elements inherent in assessing the necessity under Article 8 of a measure placing a child for adoption. In particular, it considers that in seeking to identify the best interests of a child and in assessing the necessity of any proposed measure in the context of placement proceedings, the domestic court must demonstrate that it has had regard to, inter alia, the age, maturity and ascertained wishes of the child, the likely effect on the child of ceasing to be a member of his original family and the relationship the child has with relatives</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.&#8217; </span></p>

I consider that this is the same as the domestic test (as is evidenced by the remarks of Hale LJ (as she then was) in Re C and B (Care Order: Future Harm), para [34] quoted by Baroness Hale of Richmond in para [198] above), but it is unnecessary to explore that point further&#8230;&#8217; </span></p>

These difficulties and the possible harm to the child can be ameliorated by the provision and intervention and support of a child psychologist and social worker who can work with W and her family in the manner suggested by Dr Willemsen. They are likely to be short to medium term difficulties which are capable of being overcome by appropriate professional support over the first year and more; should difficulties arise in future I am reassured by the approach of the father and the parenting abilities he has demonstrated while bringing up his children before and after the orders were made in respect of W in September 2013.</p>

When this is likely to occur it is not possible to say, and while it is possible that she would not feel aggrieved by her situation it is most unlikely that she will not be confused by it. As Mr and Mrs A, through no fault of their own, are not prepared for dealing with a disaffected child or adolescent the likelihood of breakdown as described by Mr Hatter is a real one.</p>

The sense of belonging referred to by Dr Willemsen in his evidence is fundamental to her sense of identity, her sense of herself and her place in the world. These are matter that I am bound to consider as highly relevant to her welfare throughout her life, as described by Sir James Munby, P (above) in <span style="font-style:italic">B-S.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reject the local authority&#8217;s (and the guardian&#8217;s) case in respect of their ill-founded assessment of the abilities of the father to recognise when his child needs support or when he is in difficulty which does not concur with the evidence of the two experts, whose evidence I prefer. There is no objective evidence or reason to believe that the father would not support W with the assistance of professionals. I was impressed by his realistic expectations of difficulties ahead for W <span style="font-style:italic">from her point of view</span> and, having observed him in court and heard his oral evidence I believe that he has the commitment and emotional intelligence to support his daughter over what will be a very difficult and distressing transition in the short term. These difficulties though real are not sufficient to deny this child her place within her own family of origin and the law which I have set out above requires that she should be reunited with her family. The facts of this case do not amount to the last resort or a situation where &#8220;nothing else will do&#8221;. The circumstances of this case set out in this judgment do not dislodge the presumption that a child should be brought up within her family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact that W has been with the As for some time (16 months) and is settled with them may militate against a move in the short term but it cannot form the reason for W to remain in an adoptive placement when balanced against her welfare for the rest of her life. I keep in mind the word of Lord Neuberger at [103] of <span style="font-style:italic">Re B </span>referred to above<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>The effect on Mr and Mrs A of W being moved away from them to be reunited with her family of origin will be distressing and difficult to bear; hence their inability to contemplate playing an active role in any transition but their welfare is not my paramount concern; that is with W&#8217;s life-long welfare. When balancing the effects of reunification against those of remaining in an adoptive placement the principles as set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B </span>and the Court of Appeal decisions to which I have already referred are  binding on me and even if there were not a presumption that children are best brought up within their natural families I would still conclude that it is in the interests of W&#8217;s welfare throughout her life that she should be reunited with her father and siblings, and her mother (W will also be able to have a relationship with her mother as she can take part in contact with her siblings in due course) to live within her family as she grows up and to take her place among them for the rest of her life. If she remains where she is all those ties with her family of origin will be lost and the advantages of being brought up within her family, seeing her mother will be denied her.</p>

I have quoted from cases above where this is set out clearly; it has been repeated time and again. I remain concerned however about the commitment, attitude and approach of the local authority in this case. The manner in which Ms Alsop dealt with the father&#8217;s employment was cavalier and undermining of the father at best. It is illustrative of the seemingly belligerent behaviour and oppositional stance adopted by this local authority toward the father and by extension his children. I am yet to be convinced that they would approach any reunification openly and offer the family the positive support that it needs and is entitled to; therefore I am pleased that the local authority have indicated that they will fund an independent social worker to oversee the transition and its aftermath during which time it is to hoped that positive professional and mutually trusting relationships can be built.</p>
