He is undoubtedly very firmly rooted in that country.  He lives in Jeddah in a home which is, on any view, a spectacular property whether valued at &#163;16.7 million as he contends or &#163;26.7 million, as the Wife contends.  I am told that around 40 staff are employed to maintain this palatial residence.  It was undoubtedly the main matrimonial home.</p>

She is a national of the Lebanon and also of Saudi Arabia.  She resides at the London Property.  She has a three year investor&#8217;s visa to remain in this country.  I am satisfied that, at the end of the three year period, she will be able to renew the visa.  After five years, she can obtain permanent residency.  </p>

His second marriage took place in 1959 and produced two daughters, AK (now aged 53) and LK (now aged 50) as well as a son, FK (aged 45).  Indeed, in total he has had five wives, although numbers four and five post-date his marriage to the Wife in this case and can only have been very short marriages on any view.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In 1969, the Wife moved from Lebanon to Saudi Arabia to work as an air hostess.  The parties met in 1975 and commenced a relationship.  I am satisfied that, by that time, the Husband was already immensely successful and wealthy.  He is a self-made man.  His main business, the K Group, is primarily a property development business in Saudi Arabia.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have had some difficulty in establishing exactly when the Husband purchased the constituent parts of what is now the London Property.  The evidence is all over the place.  There seems little doubt that he purchased three flats separately, namely Flats A, B and C.  It may be that he acquired Flat A on 18th November 1969, although he also gives dates of June 1975 and January 1980.  Flat B is equally unclear, with dates of purchase given in August 1970, late 1970s and December 1984.  The same pattern appears with Flat C, where the dates given are March 1971, late 1970s and June 1980.  In any event, Flat B was registered in the name of AK Investments Ltd, whilst the other two were registered in the name of HM Ltd and then A Investments NV.  On 22nd October 1979, S Investments NVS Investments&#8221;) was incorporated in Curacao in the Dutch Antilles.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The parties married in 1979.  Interestingly, they did so at the Central London Mosque.  The Wife said it was because she was living here at the time.  The marriage was pursuant to Sharia law but was recognised in Saudi Arabia.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">By mid 1980, Flat C was registered in the name of S Investments.  Bearer share certificates were issued for S Investments on 15th April 1981 and are now held by SGG (Curacao) Custodian Foundation.  In March 1988, the other two flats were also transferred to S Investments, although A Investments may, for a time, have owned S Investments.  The three flats were directly above and below each other on three separate floors.  The flat was made into one very large maisonette with an internal staircase in about 1985.  It has superb views over a London Park.  There are six bedrooms and two staff flats.  The Single Joint Expert, Justin Mason of Knight Frank, values it at &#163;14,500,000.  This figure must have been a considerable disappointment to both parties, who had previously believed it was worth up to &#163;22 million.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The parties had two children, both boys.  The elder, IK, was born in August 1981 in Cannes.  Tragically, he died in April 2010 in Jeddah.  I have no doubt that this tragedy has been a significant factor in the breakdown of the parties&#8217; marriage.  The younger, EK, was born in May 1985, at the Portland Hospital.  He is therefore now aged 29.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In 1999, the parties divorced in Saudi Arabia.  The Husband performed a Talaq.  The Wife says it was due to a disagreement over IK but I have not investigated this.  She continued to live in Saudi Arabia.  She received financial support from the Husband although she said it stopped at some point.  During 2000, the Husband was staying in London for a number of months.  The reason (which is disputed) is irrelevant.  I find that the Wife came to see him in London.  There is a dispute as to why she came.  She says he contacted her sister and asked her to contact him.  He says that his Mother died whilst he was in London.  The Wife came to see him to offer her sympathies.  Both say that the other proposed remarriage.  The Wife says that the Husband promised to transfer to her five properties.  The first was the London Property.  The second was the Jeddah home. The third was a property in Cannes.  The fourth was a property in Paris.  The fifth is described in her pleadings as &#8220;a property in Beirut&#8221;.  The Wife says that she feared conflict with the Husband&#8217;s family from his other marriages and was not prepared to remarry without security.  The Husband denies the promise.  He argues that the Wife would be in a far stronger financial position by remarrying him.  He asks, rhetorically, why would he agree to give away all his homes for no good reason?  I will obviously have to return to this aspect.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In any event, the parties agreed to reconcile.  They remarried in 2002 in Jeddah.  The remarriage does appear to have resulted in a power shift in the Husband&#8217;s business interests.  Previously, his eldest son, MS appears to have been playing a very significant role in the management of the K Group.  Gradually, IK began to manage the Group, despite his tender age, although he had the assistance of professional employees such as Mr AH, amongst others.  The Husband&#8217;s case is that IK along with another employee, WAS, subsequently mismanaged the business badly.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is the Wife&#8217;s case that the Husband is worth some $1 billion overall.  She says that he has generated his fortune by buying and developing property and land in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  It does appear that he has made a speciality of acquiring land that is subject to rival claims and sorting out the dispute in his favour.  I can entirely understand that such investments may be spectacularly successful but they may equally founder hopelessly and, in some circumstances, lose their value entirely.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is clear that the standard of living during the marriage was lavish and exceptional.  I have seen photographs of the London Property and the Jeddah home that clearly show the opulence involved.  In addition, the apartment in Paris had a gross value, when sold, of &#8364;15,750,000.  The Cannes villa is said to be worth around &#8364;17 million.  Both were acquired around 1983.  Mr Pointer QC for the Wife was able to show the Husband a schedule of projected expenditure for the year 2010 showing spending, after excluding loan repayments, of some &#163;13 million.  Even the Husband&#8217;s case is that his current spending is over &#163;2 million pa.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Husband&#8217;s case is that the money has, in effect, run out, due primarily to the difficulties his real estate business is facing in Saudi Arabia.  This is, of course, seriously in dispute.  I will have to make findings, doing the best I can.  The Wife says that the Husband&#8217;s standard of living shows no reduction.  The Husband points to the very large mortgages on all the properties and the fact that he has had to sell two properties in the last few years.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Another important issue on which I will have to make findings is whether or not the Husband activated the alleged promise to transfer the properties to the Wife.  The Husband&#8217;s case is that he did nothing to effect any transfers until over three years later when he did make some transfers but these were solely for tax planning reasons.  He says he always ensured that the ultimate beneficial interests in the properties remained with him.  </p>

The Husband says this was done, temporarily, as he was facing litigation with a bank and wanted to ensure any judgment could not be enforced against the property.  To make the transfer, he had to give the Wife a sum of SR 100 million, which she immediately paid back to him as the consideration.  Whilst I will have to determine the motivation for this and the other transactions, there is no doubt that the property was transferred back to the Husband in June 2011.  He says that this was because he had managed to resolve the litigation with the Bank satisfactorily in February 2011.   He does not say that he paid the Wife any consideration at that point.    </p>

A French legal practice, Alerion, was instructed to advise.  The documents show that tax planning was a high priority so far as this was concerned.  These arrangements came to fruition in June 2006.  A company that became known as L Holdings SA was set up to hold the Cannes property.  The shares were transferred as to 99% to the Wife and 1% to IK, whose shareholding was transferred to EK after his death.   An identical arrangement was put in place for the Paris flat, utilising a company that became M Holdings SA.  Both companies were registered in Luxembourg.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The position so far as the London Property is concerned is far more opaque.  The Husband had undoubtedly given a personal guarantee to Barclays for the loan secured against the property on 15th October 2005.  It appears that the loan at that point was &#163;8,662,500.  The Wife says this was necessary because he was going to transfer the shares in S Investments to her.  On 27th October 2005, Stephenson Harwood, the Husband&#8217;s solicitors, sent an email to IK suggesting transferring the shares in S Investments to the Wife whilst protecting the Husband&#8217;s rights of occupation. Indeed, it appears as though, the same month, the Husband was given a licence to occupy the property.  The document contains the signatures of the Husband and the Wife, plus their initials on each page.  There is a dispute as to whether or not the Wife was signing as a witness or on behalf of S Investments.   In June 2008, it was decided to appoint EK and WAS as directors of S Investments.  There seems little doubt that no Board Meeting actually took place but the &#8220;Minutes of a Board Meeting&#8221; achieving this objective were produced dated 21st June 2008.  Regrettably, there are two different versions of this document.  One has the Wife and IK signing as &#8220;owner/shareholders&#8221;.  The other has the Husband and IK doing so, again purportedly as &#8220;owner/shareholders&#8221;.  I will have to return to my findings as to this in due course.</p>

The document relates to the two French properties and acknowledges &#8220;without pressure or aggression&#8221; that the two properties are in fact fully owned by the Husband, who is consequently the only beneficial owner.

The Wife was given virtually all the shares in the new company but her sister, AA, and EK were given one share each.  The Beirut property was then sold for $15,500,000.  The Husband says this was done for tax reasons as it was beneficial for tax purposes to have the company owned by Lebanese Nationals at the time of sale.  He says they were his nominees.  There is no doubt that the proceeds of sale were paid to the Husband with the Wife&#8217;s knowledge and consent.   She wrote a letter to that effect on 19th May 2011.</p>

He exhibited a report from a retired judge Sheikh Ibrahim Mohamed bin Ali al-Dribi which purported to give a summary of the litigation involving the various plots of land, indicating a very pessimistic view of the Group&#8217;s chances of success.  I gave permission to the Husband to call AH.  No attempt was made to call Sheikh al-Dribi and I cannot therefore place any significant reliance on his statement.</p>

This meant that, after deduction of the costs of sale and the mortgage, the net equity was a very disappointing &#163;3,265,000.  Mr Mason&#8217;s report was challenged by Mr Tim Amos QC for the Husband on the basis that, given a number of difficulties, it was in fact over optimistic.  He did not, however, call any evidence to establish the contention.  I was impressed by Mr Mason&#8217;s evidence.  He told me that the property was somewhat tired and dated.  I accept his evidence as to the valuation.  I do accept that the property may be quite difficult to sell.  </p>

He submits that this court has no jurisdiction to make an order under Part III as the Wife is not domiciled here, the basis on which she asserted her claim.  He says that, even if I am against him in that regard, the application is without merit, taking into account the factors in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>.  He argues that I should dismiss it as being nothing more than blatant forum shopping.  In any event, he says the Husband has made fair provision for the Wife already by allowing her to retain the proceeds of sale of the Paris flat.  Very much as a fall back position, he says that, if I am against him and consider the court should make a further award, it should come from the equity in Cannes.  He asks me to order a sale of the London Property and to make a possession order against the Wife.  </p>

The concept of reasonable needs is, of course, a very elastic one.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am firmly of the view that I do not need to consider in any detail the numerous authorities on ascertaining the beneficial interests in property.  In almost every respect, the section 17 application is subsumed by the Part III application.  Moreover, I am very clear that, in this particular case, a determination of the facts will obviate any need to consider in depth the law as to property ownership.  There is, however, one aspect that I must consider carefully and that is the concept of a company owning a property as nominee  for its controller as established by the Supreme Court decision in the case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/34" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 34" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 34</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 2 FLR 732" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 2 FLR 732</ref>.

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Whether assets legally vested in a company are beneficially owned by its controller is a highly fact-specific issue.  It is not possible to give general guidance going beyond the ordinary principles and presumptions of equity, especially those relating to gifts and resulting trusts.  But, I venture to suggest, however tentatively, that in the case of the matrimonial home, the facts are quite likely to justify the inference that the property was held on a trust for a spouse who owned and controlled the company.  In many, perhaps most cases, the occupation of the company&#8217;s property as the matrimonial home of its controller will not be easily justified in the company&#8217;s interest, especially if it is gratuitous.  The intention will normally be that the spouse in control of the company intends to retain a degree of control over the matrimonial home which is not consistent with the company&#8217;s beneficial ownership.  Of course, structures can be devised which give a different impression, and some of them may be entirely genuine.  But where, say, the terms of acquisition and occupation of the matrimonial home are arranged between the husband in his personal capacity and the husband in his capacity as the sole effective agent of the company (or someone acting at his direction), judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to be sceptical about whether the terms of occupation are really what they are said to be, or are simply a sham to conceal the reality of the husband&#8217;s beneficial ownership.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Numerous other matters of law have been raised at various points.  I have considered very carefully all the legal principles and authorities relied on by both sides.  At this point, I only need to remind myself of two in particular.  First, I have conducted the case in English.  This was not the first language of any of the witnesses, other than Mr Mason and Mr Haque.  Three of the witnesses (including the Husband) gave evidence in Arabic by video link translated by an interpreter at this end.  One other witness gave evidence here in Arabic.  The other three witnesses (including the Wife) gave evidence in English but it was not their first language.  I accept that I must therefore take great care in assessing the evidence, given that processing information provided in a foreign language (or translated from a foreign language) may put the participant at a disadvantage.  I must guard against the very real possibility that questions or answers or both are misunderstood or at the least nuances and shades of different meaning are lost in the process.  I also accept that answers may be repeated by the interpreter in a dispassionate/neutral manner whereas the original response may have been loaded with relevant emotion.  I have taken all this into account in assessing the evidence of all the witnesses and, in particular, both parties.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Second, the Wife&#8217;s case is that the Husband has not given a full and frank account of his financial position. I remind myself that the burden of proof is on he or she who seeks to assert a positive case as to disputed facts, although it is for the respondent to the application to provide to the applicant and the court all the relevant information.  This has been described as the duty to provide full and frank disclosure. The standard of proof is the civil standard, namely the balance of probabilities.  I have considered the authorities in this area carefully, including the decision of Sachs J in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">J v J</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1955] P 215" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1955">[1955] P 215</ref>, the Court of Appeal in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Baker v Baker</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 829" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 829</ref> and Mostyn J in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Kremen v Agrest</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 2 FLR 414" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 2 FLR 414</ref>. I have to consider the competing evidence and the various documents which the Wife says show the Husband&#8217;s account of his financial circumstances to be untrue.  Butler-Sloss LJ said in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Baker</span> that the principle had been accepted for over forty years that a court can draw inferences in an appropriate case.  It is up to the respondent to open the cupboard door and show that the cupboard is bare.  If he does not do so, the court can draw the inference that the cupboard is not bare.  This is not an improper reversal of the burden of proof.  It remains for the applicant to prove her case.  A failure by the respondent to discharge the duty of providing full and frank disclosure can, therefore, lead the court to draw such inferences as are appropriate.  If the inferences drawn are, in fact, unfair on the respondent, he only has himself to blame.</p>

In some respects, I am not going to be able to accept her evidence.  I find that she has embellished and altered her recollection to suit her case and the subsequent history.  It is, however, clear that she is not a lady of business.  I am quite clear that she was primarily a homemaker and mother.  This does not make her contribution to this marriage any the less.  The authorities make it clear that she is not to be discriminated against for the way in which the parties organised their respective roles.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Husband gave his evidence in Arabic by way of video link from Jeddah.  I consider that, for a man approaching the age of ninety at the time, he was in good health and robust.  He understood all the questions and answered clearly and with great courtesy.  He did, occasionally, attempt to hide behind a lack of memory but, in general, his evidence was far more impressive than that of his Finance Director, AH.  This does not mean that I accept all his evidence.  In material respects, I reject it.  In particular, I reject it as to the current financial position of the K Group. I do, however, largely accept it in relation to the beneficial interests in the various properties.  </p>

On any view, she has been habitually resident here throughout the period of one year ending with the date on which she made the second application, namely 13th November.  She resided almost throughout at the London Property . She left the country only for a short holiday at the Cannes property and for the period when she had to reside in Beirut so as to be able to apply for her investor&#8217;s visa.  In fairness, Mr Amos did not actively contest that this was the case.  </p>

I accept that she has a Lebanese domicile of origin but it is clear that she lost this in favour of a domicile of choice in Saudi Arabia during the 44 years that she lived there from 1969 to 2013.  It is equally clear that she has now lost that domicile of choice.  I am quite satisfied that she has left Saudi Arabia permanently.  Her marriage has broken down irretrievably.  I accept her reasoning as to why she would not want to live there again.  I find that she only remained there after her first divorce because EK was, at the time, a minor and IB was still dependant.  I recognise that EK remains there but he has married.  Her evidence was compelling when she told me that she could visit him whenever she wanted but would not wish to live there.</p>

She told me she has no wish to return to Lebanon.  Although her sister is there, it is a country that has a troubled history and is not entirely free of those difficulties.  She told me in evidence &#8220;I want to stay in London for my whole life&#8221;.  She had earlier said she loved England and will die here.  On this, I believe her.  It was suggested that there was &#8220;a pull of the United States&#8221;, as several of her relatives are there but she has no real connections to that country and no right to reside there.  She has a right to reside here for the next three years and I am satisfied that she is able to extend that to permanent residence.  I find that she will do so.  There is therefore jurisdiction for me to consider the Wife&#8217;s Part III application.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I accept the evidence of the Wife and her sister, AA, that the Husband did contact the Wife via AA about a possible reconciliation and remarriage.  I find that they met in London.  I consider the Wife was concerned about her financial security but remarriage of itself would have improved her position immeasurably.  On the balance of probabilities, I find that she did raise her financial security with the Husband, possibly to test his reaction as an indicator of whether or not he was serious about the reconciliation.  I reject the claim that he promised to transfer all his domestic properties to her.  It is inherently improbable.  He is a Saudi businessman with great stature.  I cannot conceive that he would willingly part with all his residential property.  Why should he?  I consider that he probably gave the Wife various assurances that she would be looked after properly.  He had, however, no intention of losing control of his various residential properties.  </p>

He did not place any of the properties in her name.  The Wife took no action.  She did not complain, so far as I can ascertain.  When the Husband bought a property in Beirut in 2004, he acquired the property in his name.  Given that the Wife is from the Lebanon, he would surely have transferred that property into her name if there was any truth in his alleged promise.  There was not.</p>

He did indeed change the legal title to various properties but he remained the sole beneficial owner of each property.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There are numerous documents which support this fully. I have no doubt that the Wife knew it was the case as well.  So far as the French properties were concerned, the transfers to the two Luxembourg companies were part of a very carefully considered tax planning strategy to avoid French wealth tax.  Alerion was instructed to advise and carry out such a strategy for this reason and this reason alone.  I reject Mr Pointer&#8217;s submission that the Husband could have done this without giving the Wife the shares.  He was advised to put as much distance between himself and the structure.  He did so.  I have already referred to the email IK sent on 29th April 2006, to M CG, the lawyer advising the Husband at Alerion saying that he had &#8220;attached two translated acknowledgments. The first is us (my mother, my brother and myself) acknowledging the true ownership of any properties, bank accounts, companies etc&#8230;is to my father&#8221;.  I accept entirely that the document we have is unsigned but the wording is clear.  It sets out the transfer of a number of assets to the Wife, including the Jeddah property, the London Property and the Paris and Cannes properties.  It then says &#8220;all the abovementioned currently or in the future as stated with details is fully owned by (the Husband).&#8221; It refers to the fact that he has paid for all of these assets from his personal money.  It acknowledges that the three individuals are &#8220;fully ready at first demand from him to register whatever he wants or transfer the company shares or bank accounts or cash money to his name or any name he selects without any objection or prejudice or referring to any legal action in KSA or abroad.&#8221;  I consider it is fanciful to suggest that the Wife was not aware of this.  </p>

He did not intend to give the assets to (the Wife and the children) and this fact was always understood by all concerned.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 11th May 2010, the Wife and EK signed an &#8220;Acknowledgment&#8221;.  It said that &#8220;without pressure or aggression&#8230;we hereby state that, as beneficial owners of the companies (M Holding and L Holding), that the properties (Paris and Cannes) are in the fact fully owned by (the Husband), who he is consequently the only beneficial owner.&#8221;  It goes on to add that &#8220;hereby, we the abovementioned two individuals, are fully ready at first demand from him to register or transfer the companies shares (M Holding and L Holding) to his name without any objection or prejudice or referring to any legal  action in KSA or abroad&#8221;.  The Wife complains that she was asked to sign this shortly after the death of IK.  I certainly accept that it was signed only some seventeen days after his death, but I am satisfied that it reflected the reality and the Wife knew this.  The fact that the declaration clearly shows the companies holding the properties on trust for the Husband is, however, very relevant when I come to consider the position so far as the London Property is concerned.</p>

I have been referred to a number of authorities concerning illegality but I do not need to consider them.  The property was subsequently transferred back into the name of the Husband in June 2011.  She did not complain. She did not say that this re-transfer was in breach of the agreement.  It was not.  She was, of course, in no position to object but I am quite clear in my own mind that this Husband would never want any of his wives to be the true beneficial owner of his magnificent palace in Jeddah.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The position is even clearer so far as the Beirut property is concerned.  It was only transferred to K Real Estate SAL (Lebanon) in the run up to the sale.  At virtually the same time, on 19th May 2011, the Wife and EK signed a letter confirming that the sale proceeds were to be paid to the Husband.  When the property was sold for $15,500,000, the net proceeds were indeed paid to him.  I am quite satisfied this was all done for tax reasons.  It had absolutely nothing to do with an alleged agreement in 2000/2001.   Indeed, if it had, the Wife would have received the proceeds.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">During the course of the case, it clearly emerged that there had been far more manoeuvring as to the bearer shares in S Investments than the Husband had been prepared to admit.  On 14th September 2004, RE, a lawyer at the Husband&#8217;s London solicitors, Stephenson Harwood, sent an email to an employee of the K Group, AE, which said &#8220;following discussions with Barclays, they have agreed in principle to hold the bearer certificates in Jersey on behalf of (the Wife). We are sending them the form of Certificate of Deposit for their approval.  As you may recall, AMACO (the previous name for SGG), previously confirmed to us that this Certificate will be sufficient to transfer the beneficial interest in the bearer shares from (the Husband) to (the Wife).&#8221; There follows a number of communications of a similar nature in which statements are made such as &#8220;SK now proposes to transfer the beneficial ownership of the shares to his wife&#8230;&#8221; and that, if this was to happen, Barclays would need a personal guarantee from the Husband.  Indeed, Mr Pointer relies on a further email from RE dated 19th October 2005 which indicates that the transfer had taken place. It says &#8220;as you may be aware, a Certificate of Deposit has been signed by both SK and MA however it also needs to be signed on behalf of the Bank&#8230;&#8221;  The email goes on to say that &#8220;in view of the transfer of the beneficial ownership of the Property to MA, I understand there is also to be a lease of the Property granted to SK for his lifetime.&#8221; Indeed, a licence to occupy was prepared and signed by both the Husband and the Wife.</p>

Whilst I am quite satisfied that no Board Meeting took place, I have already mentioned that I have seen two virtually identical Minutes of a meeting of the shareholders.  One version has the Wife and IK present and signing as &#8220;Owner/Shareholders&#8221;.  The other has the Husband and IK present and signing as &#8220;Owner/Shareholders&#8221;.

It was, however, clear that SGG was kept largely in the dark as to what was going on.  Inevitably, SGG&#8217;s principals and employees have put in statements saying that everything was above board and the London Property was an asset of S Investments.  I heard oral evidence from a former employee, MTZ.  She stated that the Husband was the sole beneficial owner of S Investments and that S Investments owned the London Property.  Yet she clearly knew nothing about the mid-2005 manoeuvring I have set out above.  She was referred to the financial statements and auditor&#8217;s report of S Investments for the years to 31st December 2000, 2001 and 2002.  All three documents state that S Investments has no assets.  Her only response was to say that these accounts were prepared by a Saudi accountant, M Zufari and that Curacao law at the time did not require any property to be included.  This still does not explain why the accounts of S Investments do not include the London Property as an asset, if indeed, it was an asset.  The accountant, moreover, said that the statements &#8220;present fairly the financial position of the corporation&#8221;.  It is difficult to see how this could be the case if the London Property really was an asset of S Investments.  </p>

However, that does not really assist the Husband given that all the accounts are dated 26th May 2014, long after this case commenced and it was known that this was an important issue.  It is right that SGG had attempted to obtain these accounts, to no avail, on a number of occasions.  It is also right that the K Group put in train the preparation of the accounts last year, before this litigation commenced but I am told the versions I have seen are &#8220;restated&#8221; accounts.  I accept that MTZ told me that the first drafts included the property but I am by no means clear when they were first prepared.</p>

I have formed the very clear conclusion that this is because it does not matter to him.  He is the beneficial owner and S Investments is just his nominee.  There is no doubt in my mind that the London Property is a matrimonial home. It is not the main matrimonial home but you can have more than one matrimonial home and the parties here undoubtedly occupied it as husband and wife.  The observations of Lord Sumption are therefore pertinent.  There are, however, numerous other reasons why it is clear that the Husband is the sole beneficial owner.  For example:-</p>

The Wife accepted this offer immediately, agreeing to sign the necessary documents. Indeed, she signed a power of attorney to the Husband to operate the accounts of M Holdings.  Unfortunately, the sale did not complete but a further offer was received in June 2013.  On this occasion, the Wife refused to give authority to the Husband and said she would deal with the transaction.  She did, however, confirm that she would transfer the proceeds to the Husband.  The Wife signed the final sale agreement on 11th December 2013 but, in breach of the agreement, kept the proceeds of sale on 26th December.  I have already noted that the Husband subsequently agreed that she could retain these proceeds as her &#8220;divorce settlement&#8221;.  </p>

If this had not been the position, I do not believe the French lawyers would have paid her the proceeds of the Paris flat.  I do not know if the Husband has any right of redress but I suspect he does not.  It may be that it is for this reason that Mr Amos urges me to make any award, if I find that one is justified, out of the proceeds of sale of the Cannes property.</p>

It also says that his net annual income is $76 million.  The notes say that he is an extremely well known Saudi businessman with an excellent reputation in the Kingdom. Whilst I recognise that a businessman is unlikely to present a negative position to a bank, it is noteworthy that this chimes exactly with the Wife&#8217;s account.</p>

It shows total net assets of SR 575,382,789, which is just under &#163;96 million at a rate of exchange of 6 Saudi Riyals to the Pound.  The assets include SR 35,413,245 in cash (&#163;5.9 million), investments of SR 27.9 million (&#163;4.65 million), lands available for sale of SR 344.6 million (&#163;57.4 million) and fixed assets of SR 42.9 million (&#163;7.15 million).

The Bank, however, was given different figures, albeit for a slightly different accounting period. The same auditor, Ahmed A Bajneid, certified on 22nd September 2013 that this disclosure was a fair presentation of the assets and liabilities of the Group.  It showed total assets (at market value as opposed to book value) of SR 3.7 billion (or &#163;616 million) with liabilities of SR 242 million (much of which consisted of the loans on the London Property  and French properties).

The Bank, on the other hand, was told the income forecast for 2014 was SR 276 million (&#163;46 million).  Yet AH and the retired judge firmly contend that there are no assets at all as everything is subject to litigation that will, in all likelihood, be lost.  AH&#8217;s evidence on the matter was deeply unsatisfactory.  He kept referring to the difference between book value and market value to explain the difference between the schedules.  He specifically said on seven separate occasions that the value presented to the Bank was either the &#8220;real value&#8221; or the &#8220;market value&#8221;.  He did, however, refer to the figures in his schedule showing nil value as being &#8220;the value if it was to be liquidated&#8221;.  I need to be fair to him and not to place too much weight on his statements that the figures to the Bank were &#8220;market value&#8221; because it was tolerably clear that he was trying to contrast these values to what he alleged was the current realisable value.  Nevertheless, I simply cannot accept the overall presentation.  It would involve finding that the Group had deliberately misled the Bank and that all the investments had very quickly become of nil value.  Attempts to blame IK simply do not work when IK died four and a half years ago.  </p>

If the Husband is so wealthy and has no cash flow problems, it is difficult to see why these properties are so heavily mortgaged.  Mr Pointer said that it would make sense to have a large loan outstanding on Cannes to guard against French Wealth Tax. He may be right about that, although I have no expert evidence to that effect.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have come to the conclusion that I cannot accept the evidence of the Husband and AH.  It was self-serving.  The documents produced did not begin to support it. I do accept that there are likely to be some difficulties with legal title. After all, it is accepted that buying properties subject to such difficulties is the Husband&#8217;s modus operandi.  He has been remarkably successful in so doing but I propose to assume that one-half of his ventures will go bad.  For this reason, I assess his Saudi wealth at half Mr Pointer&#8217;s figure (which assumes all land deals come good).  This leads to a figure for the value of the K Group of &#163;250 million.  In addition, he has the value of the Jeddah property, which I assess at the Wife&#8217;s figure of &#163;26.7 million, making a broad Saudi wealth of &#163;275 million.  If that is unfair to him, he only has himself to blame for trying to pretend all the deals will fail.  Whilst I accept that he has to wait until another sale is achieved, there is nothing to indicate that he is not making such sales with sufficient regularity to discharge his obligations.  He has paid his costs of these proceedings in full.  He has maintained the London Property and Cannes properties.  When we last had the figure, there was significant cash at bank in the Group.  I therefore reject the suggestion that he cannot manage his own expenditure.  He has not laid off his forty staff at the Jeddah property or placed the property on the market.  Indeed, I find that his annual expenditure is far in excess of &#163;2 million.  I put it at between &#163;5 and &#163;10 million pa.   </p>

There is absolutely no truth in it whatsoever and it does the Husband no credit to attempt to rely on it.  She is not a thief and would not have had the commercial experience to arrange such a fraud.  Moreover, why, at that stage, would the Wife want to steal from the K Group?  I have already noted that it was not until the Husband swore his Form E that the allegation was first made.  I agree with Mr Pointer that, had there been any truth in it, it would have been raised far earlier. It was, after all, AH&#8217;s evidence that the transactions were discovered after IK&#8217;s death.  It would undoubtedly have featured in the letter when the Husband allowed the Wife to keep the proceeds of sale of the Paris flat.  Moreover, the allegation has undoubtedly changed on a number of occasions.  The Form E allegation was &#163;31 million.  The schedule produced by the Husband was &#163;24 million.  AH talked of the deficit being SR 44 million (or &#163;7.3 million).  Mr Amos referred to the unexplained figure being in the order of &#163;10 million.</p>

She produced copies of her bank statements from 12th December 2006 to 28th January 2012.  They showed a very significant number of credits to the account, totalling some SR 369 million (&#163;61 million).  It was of note that SR 262 million (&#163;43.6 million) came from the Husband himself, not the K Group.  There were, however, an equally large number of transfers out. These included very significant transfers to the K Group (SR 229 million or &#163;38 million) although it is true that there were transfers to IK (SR 26.7 million or &#163;4.45 million) and EK (SR 41.7 million or &#163;6.95 million).  The Wife also produced the originals of a large number of forms on K Group headed notepaper.  They had the Husband&#8217;s signature on them.  They authorised IK to transfer money to the Wife as &#8220;a gift from me to her&#8221;.  These totalled SR 110 million (or &#163;18.3 million).  The Husband did not really dispute that these authorisations contained his signature.  It was alleged that many of them had ink smudges on the back.  It was suggested that this showed they were all signed together.  I am quite unable to make any findings about that as I have not heard expert evidence.  I do, however, reject any suggestion that the Husband would not have known what he was doing when he signed these authorisations.  He may be old but he is very much &#8220;on the ball&#8221;.  Second, even if some of these were signed retrospectively, they undoubtedly predated this dispute so cannot have been created by the Wife to deal with this argument.  </p>

I have heard significant evidence as to this.  It is right that the Wife originally said they came to London typically for at least five months each year, with trips to Cannes.  She later said the period in London was for at least two months pa.  The Husband produced a schedule purporting to show that they were here for only 10 &#8211; 12 days pa on average.  The schedule, however, is unreliable.  It includes many entries saying &#8220;unknown&#8221; or &#8220;duration unknown&#8221;.  It certainly appears to omit at least one three month visit here.  Moreover, an average over the entire period is misleading given that the Husband has been unable to travel here for over four years.  I have come to the conclusion that the average time spent here by the parties each year was between one and two months.  This is not an insignificant amount.  </p>

The Cannes property remains even though Paris has been sold.  This French connection is certainly not as great as the connection with London.  They also have a connection with the Lebanon, although this is almost entirely through the Wife and I have already found that she does not intend to live there in the future, although she will undoubtedly visit for short periods.</p>

It is common ground that the Wife has no right to claim any financial provision in Saudi Arabia. She has, of course, received the proceeds of sale of the Paris flat by the agreement of the Husband.  No order has been made elsewhere so I do not need to consider the extent to which it has been complied with.  Equally, she has no right to make a claim for financial relief elsewhere and has not omitted to exercise any such right.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Turning to the availability of property in England and Wales in respect of which an order can be made, I am satisfied that the London Property is beneficially owned by the Husband.  It follows that it is susceptible to orders of this court.  So far as the extent to which any other orders may be enforceable, I have been referred to the cases of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Razelos v Razelos (Number 2)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1970] 1 WLR 393" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1970">[1970] 1 WLR 393</ref> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hamlin v Hamlin</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] Fam 11" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] Fam 11</ref>.  In short, I do have jurisdiction to make an order in respect of a property situated outside England and Wales.  I should decline to do so if the order would be ineffective under the foreign jurisdiction or for some other reason.  But I am entitled to assume that such an order will be effective in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  </p>

I am not therefore required to dismiss the application.  I consider that there is sufficient connection with this country for this court to intervene.  The fact that the Wife has no remedy in Saudi Arabia is an important factor. When combined with the connection to this country, the existence of the London Property  here and my findings as to the Wife&#8217;s future intentions, I am satisfied that it is appropriate for me to go on and consider the section 18 factors and, in particular, the matters set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>.  </p>

Even if I ignore the position prior to the original marriage in 1979 and the period when the parties were first divorced, I am dealing with a marriage of some 31 years.  There were two children and this Wife has made a full contribution during the marriage by looking after the family and the homes.  She undoubtedly has significant needs that are unmet without an award from this court.  The Husband has the resources to meet those needs without difficulty.  </p>

I am not going to determine the issue definitively as I do not need to do so and I have not been addressed upon it.   I do, however, accept that, if this was a fully English case and it was determined solely on the basis of the law as it applies to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>, Mr Pointer might very well succeed in obtaining an award of &#163;44 million (as the Wife seeks) out of total assets of &#163;287.5 million.  I broadly accept that, in such circumstances, I would probably consider, even on a needs basis, that it would be reasonable for the Wife to have the London Property and the Cannes properties free of mortgage along with a significant income producing award.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">This case is not, however, an entirely English one.  I simply cannot ignore the Saudi element.  It is of considerable importance.  Although the Wife has satisfied me that I should make an order, I must do so on the basis of all the circumstances, which include the fact that the connection with this country is limited.  I have wondered to what extent it is appropriate to take into account enforcement difficulties that the Wife would have if I made the substantial lump sum order she seeks.  In fully English cases, I accept that such considerations are not relevant as a respondent cannot evade his or her liability by placing his assets outside the reach of the court.  In this case, however, I note that enforceability is a relevant factor in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref> and, as Lord Collins confirms in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Agbaje</span>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref> factors do not simply disappear once a judge has found that the case is suitable for an order to be made.  </p>
