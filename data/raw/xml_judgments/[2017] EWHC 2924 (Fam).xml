He is described in the papers as &#8216;handsome&#8217; and of &#8216;white British and possibly Portuguese descent&#8217;.  He has a lively personality and his social development is recorded positively.  On the 24 February 2017, following a 5 day hearing, I granted the London Borough of Islington&#8217;s application for R to be made the subject of a Placement Order.  That judgment, reported: <span style="font-weight:bold">Re.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By this morning&#8217;s hearing, Ms Hughes had honed her submissions down to one central proposition.  She contended that, on the facts, there <span style="font-weight:bold">might</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">my emphasis) </span>be &#8216;a change of circumstances&#8217; which might, if properly investigated, establish a basis for an application for leave to apply to revoke the Placement Order.  Having, sensibly, in my judgement, evaluated the evidence in these terms, Ms Hughes concentrated on the possibility that R might remain with his present carer under the aegis of a Special Guardianship Order (SGO).  This she argued would potentially be a change of circumstances which would justify the revocation of the Placement Order.  Further, she reasoned, this was not an option available to the Court when it evaluated and approved the Local Authority&#8217;s care plan, which contemplated adoption, in February 2017.  </p>

During the course of submissions I asked if I might see R&#8217;s Permanence Report.  The Local Authority was able to email it to me over a short adjournment.  I had wanted further to investigate the prospects of R being adopted within identifiable timescales.  Ms Hughes referred me to <span style="font-weight:bold">Re.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Somewhat unusually, the relevant facts upon which the mother&#8217;s argument is predicated are substantially agreed.  It is of great concern that at 3 years of age, R has spent all but a few weeks of his life in the care of FC, his &#8216;short term&#8217; foster mother.  There was no dispute at all, nor could there have been, in the February hearing but that R sees FC as his mother.  M, to her credit, has always recognised this and paid appropriate tribute to the relationship.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the unsuccessful appeal against my judgment in June of this year, M began, tentatively, to explore with FC as to whether she might be prepared to care for R long term.  That phase, &#8216;long term&#8217;, requires to be scrutinised.  What truly is being asked of FC is whether she feels able to give what is nothing less than life long commitment to R as his mother.  This requires to be stated unambiguously.  M&#8217;s overtures to FC were discrete, sensitive and entirely understandable.  I have already observed that she is an articulate and eloquent woman who, outside her catastrophic relationships with men, can sometimes show insight and sensitivity in her interpersonal relationships.  M researched the scope and ambit of the SGO and offered the fruits of her investigation to FC.  She believed she detected a positive response from her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this application I heard from Mr Jason Ward, Social Worker, whose professionalism impressed me in the earlier proceedings and whose analysis in this application served only to reinforce my earlier judgement of him.  He told me that his own preferred outcome here is for R to remain with FC under the protection of an Adoption Order.  R is still young enough for adoption to hold out for him the real chance of a stable, secure, permanent and &#8216;forever&#8217; placement.  All agree he deserves and is entitled to nothing less.  Mr Ward considers that any other regime is likely to fall short of this identified Welfare objective. I endorsed that approach in my judgment in February 2017 and, on a proper construction of the evidence, nothing has changed. My impression is that Mr Ward has not yet discounted R being adopted by his foster parent.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear, that FC has felt the strain of this highly litigious case.  The substantive hearing before me came about in consequence of a rehearing directed by the Court of Appeal, following its conclusion that hair strand testing analysis was unsatisfactory.  I have no doubt that FC has, in consequence of the twists of the litigation, at very least contemplated, at some point, the possibility of R being returned to his mother.  That is no longer a possibility.  There is no doubt that FC is very close to R and that the severance of this relationship is likely to be very distressing to both of them.  Mr Coutts, on behalf of the Local Authority, reminds me that it is often said that a secure attachment to a primary carer equips a child to transfer that attachment and to &#8216;move on&#8217;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In essence, says Mr Ward, FC needs the space and opportunity to decide whether she is able to make this ultimate commitment to R.  The label &#8216;adoption&#8217; may be, he said, less important than the acceptance of a life long emotional commitment to the child.  FC, I am told, enjoys her work as a foster carer, her own child is grown up, and now, a single woman in her early 40s, she understandably values her own independence.  That is her right.  There is no doubt that she has been ambushed by her own emotions with R.  Mr Ward explained that FC is in an emotional upheaval at the moment.  This was already evident from the papers and I have no doubt is fully recognised by M herself.  It is important for the M to know that if R decides that she cannot take on this responsibility it will be in R&#8217;s best interest for an alternative adoptive placement to be found.  It is, if I may say so, an indicator of FC&#8217;s personal strength that she is prepared to examine so thoroughly what she may be able to provide for R.  That this process is painful to her is entirely obvious and wholly understandable.  It is a journey that only she can complete. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I suggested to Ms Hughes that the mother may wish to consider whether this application is ultimately misconceived in that it puts pressure on FC at a time when it is most dangerous to do so.  Having watched M in court, now over the course of two hearings, I was not at all surprised that she did not heed this well intentioned suggestion.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Ward made the point that the label &#8216;Adoption&#8217; or &#8216;SGO&#8217; is to some extent less important than the establishment of long term emotional commitment to the child.  He did not discount the possibility of an SGO, the central question for him was whether it reflected a life long commitment.  I consider that this represents the very carefully balanced views of a social worker who has given this case a great deal of thought.  That said, Mr Ward was clear that the legal framework of an Adoption Order also provided a stability that he thought to be necessary.  I agree.  This is particularly so here where the legal process itself has been such a unsettling influence on the child&#8217;s life.  My earlier judgment records how a carefully planned rehabilitation failed very quickly.  Fortunately, FC was there to pick up the pieces.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus it seems to me that, properly evaluated, all the information contemplated by Ms Hughes&#8217; suggested enquiries is already before the Court.  The reality is that the foster carer does not have answers to the questions Ms Hughes poses.  I am quite sure M recognises this, just as she is able to see that Mr Ward&#8217;s hopes are very similar to her own.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Sadly, it is also necessary to record that as the mother was pursuing her appeal against my decision, her life was reverting to a familiar pattern.  The relationship with her present partner had ended up with M bloodied and bruised and with him remanded in custody.  According to the crime reports, M had a visible black eye and bruising.  Whilst her contact with her son has always been stimulating and good fun it has to be acknowledged that as R gets older seeing his mum in a bruised or fragile condition is likely to be unsettling and upsetting to him.  That will itself potentially undermine the security of any placement.  Ms Hughes, properly, asks me to record that there is no record of the mother having attended at any contact to date with visible bruising.  I am pleased to be able to do so.  </p>
