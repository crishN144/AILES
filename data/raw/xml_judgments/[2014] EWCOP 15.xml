She firmly denied ever being asked whether her son could raise a mortgage on her property, although I was told by DH that VH had agreed to the mortgage being raised. VH&#8217;s sister had informed me that VH had spoken to her about raising a loan on her property in 2010. I was unable to get confirmation of this from VH. I found that she did not have capacity to deal with the complaint.</p>

In terms of her dementing illness and the progression of her condition I have serious doubts as to whether she understood that DH was raising a mortgage in October 2011 on her property and that he was going to spend the money renovating his partner&#8217;s property in Wakefield. I failed to find any evidence that VH had been coerced into accepting the mortgage arrangement or she had been coerced regarding any other matter. The simple fact is that she has been very forgetful and that she did not have capacity to understand the mechanics of raising a mortgage on her property and of the money raised to be spent in renovating the property belonging to DH&#8217;s partner.</p>

Therefore it is the Public Guardian&#8217;s view that DH has breached his fiduciary duty by making an unapproved and excessive gift which has substantially depleted VH&#8217;s capital.&#8221; </p>

There were no conditions of repayment placed upon me nor indeed was there any agreement that I would pay my mum back.  &#8230; No application was made to the Court of Protection to ratify the gift because Mum was fully competent, willing and desirous of making the gift to me. It did not occur to me that I would need to obtain the consent of the Court of Protection because my mother fully understood what she was doing and I have no doubt Mum would have been insulted if I had suggested that I should ask the Court of Protection to ratify it. Furthermore, it was and still is my understanding that since Mum had capacity to make the gift I did not need to make an application to the Court of Protection to ratify it. I was not acting on behalf of someone incapable of making their own decisions and therefore my understanding was that I didn&#8217;t need to consider the duties under the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) relating to best interests. If my understanding of the MCA is incorrect then this was a genuine mistake and I would ask the court retrospectively to ratify the gift.&#8221;</p>

In the case of a will the degree required is always high. In the case of a contract, a deed made for consideration or a gift <span style="font-style:italic">inter vivos</span>, whether by deed or otherwise, the degree required varies with the circumstances of the transaction. Thus, at one extreme, if the subject-matter and value of a gift are trivial in relation to the donor&#8217;s other assets a low degree of understanding will suffice. But, at the other, if its effect is to dispose of the donor&#8217;s only asset of value and thus for practical purposes to pre-empt the devolution of his estate under his will or on his intestacy, then the degree of understanding required is as high as that required for a will, and the donor must understand the claims of all potential donees and the extent of the property to be disposed of.&#8221;</p>

If he really was in financial difficulties, and if his mother had offered to bail him out, it is astonishing that he should have spent all the money she had raised in renovating a property, which was owned solely by his partner from whom he was about to separate. By any standards this was an abuse of his mother&#8217;s generosity. </p>

His reply was that it would have been an &#8216;insult&#8217; to her - &#8216;a slap in the face&#8217; - to have refused the gift. This response is unacceptable and shows that, when faced with a conflict between his interests and his mother&#8217;s, he would place his own interests first.</p>
