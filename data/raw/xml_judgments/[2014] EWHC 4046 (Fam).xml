	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By 1pm at the end of the first morning of what had been listed as the five-day final hearing of financial remedy cross-applications between these former spouses Mr and Mrs Thiry (to whom for convenience I shall refer as the husband and wife) Mr Lewis Marks QC had completed his combined opening and concluding observations. This was achieved through a combination of circumstances: the huge documentation in the case had been culled to a single bundle in accordance with the most recent manifestation of PD 27A; the husband neither attended nor was represented; and I not only have had previous acquaintance with the case in March this year and at last month's pre-trial review but, obviously assisted by the <span style="font-style:italic">reductio ad necessitatem</span> of the bundle, had had an opportunity of pre-reading the proffered material.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If all that were not of itself to be remarked upon, other features render this case unique in my experience. On behalf of the wife Mr Marks, supported by Mr Harry Oliver and those who instruct them, invites me by way of principal relief to make lump sum orders against the husband personally totalling some &#8364;21.6 million. The basis on which this capital award is sought might be described as restorative justice rather than any exercise of redistributive discretion, without involving (save to the self-inflicted extent that the husband's conduct of the litigation has inflated the wife's costs bill and thus my costs award against him) any punitive element. I will also consider whether in fairness to the wife I should in addition order the husband prophylactically to fund provision for future costs in the event that the husband, here or in any other jurisdiction, embarks on a fresh round of litigation to attempt to secure an award of damages against the wife for alleged malicious damage to his reputation and his businesses which he has had every opportunity (in my judgment) to pursue within the ambit of this case, and as would have been consistent with the overriding objective in cases such as this. Indeed he has consistently threatened to do so but has proved unwilling, or it may rather be unable for want of objective merit, to strike home. Mr Marks has also invited me to consider making an assessment of the costs incurred by his client of and incidental to these applications on the indemnity basis by reference to a detailed schedule which comes in at a shade short of &#163;500,000. That schedule has been overtaken by the contents of an email sent to me and to the husband on 25 November, explaining and making a number of adjustments (not least those wrought by the foreshortened hearing) which brings the total down to just a few pounds short of &#163;456,000. That figure encompasses existing orders against the husband including two totalling &#163;38,825 where he was directed to make prompt payment (which he has not), and interest in relation to the crystallised &#163;38,825 at judgment debt rate since those payments fell due, calculated as far as 28 November. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Suffice to say at present that I propose to consider orders and to conduct a costs assessment in line with what is proposed. The form of the order necessary to reflect those elements is obviously rather fuller than that bare description would suggest, and was to an extent discussed during the course of the morning, and may need refinement in the light of the precise terms of this judgment.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the ordinary course of events one would expect a spouse against whom such orders are sought to appear to defend them at final trial. This husband has since the commencement of the wife's applications by Form A dated 8 May 2013 known the bases and the specifics upon which her claim is formulated, and in addition has for quite some while now also known what target she aimed at in terms of quantum. (The exception to that is the prophylactic and conditional "fighting chest" to which I have referred as a separate element in paragraph 2 above.) Yet he has not taken the opportunity whether in writing or in person to make submissions in response to his wife's case. So, again somewhat unusually, I perceive my first task to be to demonstrate how the husband's conduct of this litigation from virtually its onset till now has led to the situation where I without qualm or compunction base myself in concluding these applications in his absence upon the material and the presentation to which I have been directed on behalf of the wife.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The family chronologies of these parties are briefly as follows. The wife is now 50 and English, and the husband 53 and a French national now living in Belgium. Each had previously been married, the wife and her former husband concluding their divorce proceedings in 2004 at which point she received some &#163;37 million by way of divorce settlement. The husband has three adult daughters; and the wife three children of whom two are adult. In May 2006 the about-to-be spouses entered into a pre-nuptial agreement for the purposes of which the wife disclosed assets valued at &#163;32,280,000 and the husband &#8364;10,524,000. Then on 25 May 2006 they were married. They separated seven years later in May 2013, and in that same month the wife issued divorce proceedings and instituted her financial remedies claim. Both parties were initially represented by solicitors. The wife remains represented by those she first instructed: the husband's representation came to an end  when his solicitors came off the record on 20 May this year (although they had not communicated with the wife's solicitors at all since mid-March), and since then he has engaged in these proceedings (to the extent that he has) in person. </p>

Attempts on 12 and 13 November to serve the bundle (as opposed to simply its index) at the address in Belgium nominated by the husband had failed as no one was there to receive it.</p>

It records that 'the parties each come to this marriage with independent means and neither expects to be financially dependent on the other' in the event of divorce. The purpose of the agreement is therefore expressly 'to define the property that each of them owns at the time this Agreement is executed and to agree that that property shall remain each party's separate property through the marriage and beyond. This property &#8230; will remain the sole and exclusive property of each of them.' With that in view 'this Agreement is intended to operate as a statement of intent of the parties and evidence of each party's respective assets and liabilities at the commencement of the marriage.' With that in mind they declared and agreed that the property listed in two Exhibits to the Agreement 'is and shall remain the separate property' of each of them respectively. </p>

Herein lies the crux of this case, and these are propositions which the husband does not contest: indeed he asserts them.</p>

The clear inference to be drawn from the circumstances and the context must be that it was one of his daughters (or it may be that was a typographical error for all three of them) who held the companies on trust for him as to 100%: why else include them and value them (in the not insignificant aggregate amount of &#8364;3,920,000) in this list of his separate property? And indeed that conclusion, although the waters have since become muddied, seems to be the currently accepted position of the husband.</p>

She does however draw attention to a number of highly suspicious aspects to this arrangement. As I will explain, her case is that the husband took control of her assets on the basis that he would, literally, husband them for her benefit. She says that he did not fully if at all describe to her the manoeuvres he effected, nor the significance of documents which at his request she signed many of which were in French, a language in which she does not have full competence. The documentation which I have read supports these broad propositions, as indeed does the sneering, superior and supercilious tone of many of the communications with which the husband has bombarded the wife during the course of these proceedings (ignoring requests and refuting suggestions that in view of the tone of many of his abusive and indeed somewhat menacing messages he should communicate only with her solicitors).</p>

It appears that in March 2012 he was put under investigation by Belgian authorities in relation to tax/money laundering issues and, it may be, alleged embezzlement. It would seem that the focus of the investigation may be alleged cash dealings and other improprieties and irregularities to do with the management of the Hotel Odette. He complains that the effect of the investigation and restraints imposed upon the companies severely damaged his business interests. He vehemently asserts that it was the wife who made the original 'denunciation' which instigated these investigations. He stated in his Form E that she is implicated in a campaign to harm him by lending her name or support to a deliberately false report. All of this the wife just as vehemently denies.</p>

Unless I am mistaken the 6 November 2014 assertion that losses suffered by his businesses amount to &#163;43,750,000 (and a suggestion by the husband at a meeting last November that he was going to bring a claim against the wife for &#8364;27 million) are the only times that any supposed quantification has been advanced: these are bare assertions totally devoid of computational detail.

Those same lawyers were given access to the court file following an application to Juge Gr&#233;goire and were able to see on it a letter from the Belgian Tax authorities dated 20 November 2013 confirming that investigations had shown that no denunciation or complaint had been made against the husband by any third party. </p>

He has at all stages been informed of the outcome of the enquiries made on the wife's behalf in Belgium. He has nevertheless, as noted, persisted in raising the spectre or, as I would prefer to put it, hiding behind this smokescreen as a reason for deferring repayment of the inter-company loan.

He can be haughty, sarcastic, menacing and downright rude in tone (as in calling the wife and her lawyers 'insignificant pieces of shit'), but rarely redolent of clarity in his communications. And although I have heard no oral evidence from the wife I feel able to give substantial credit to what she says about their financial affairs during cohabitation, which is essentially that he ran them for them both, and hers supposedly for her benefit.</p>

As he was my husband, and he professed and seemed to be skilled, I trusted his advice.

That is to say that the wife believes she put up, in cash and by borrowing against her other corporate assets, 50% of the start-up and refurbishment costs. But she was she says from the start excluded from the business and its operations and thus from responsibility for their descent into insolvency. These were superintended by the husband. The extent of the financial ruin to which he brought the enterprise only became apparent on receipt of the report of an expert jointly-instructed in these proceedings. Since then the wife has refused to throw more good money after bad. She is prepared, and would indeed welcome, disentanglement from participation in this joint enterprise. She is prepared to transfer the shares representing her half-interest in the holding company of the hotel operation's substructure to the husband. But only if, as is submitted on her behalf would be fair, and when she receives reimbursement for the &#8364;2.6 million which she put into it together with an indemnity from the husband in respect of losses, claims, demands or other liabilities whether past or future in relation to her involvement with the hotel and any related corporate entity.</p>

I declined to do so. My decision was not the subject of any attempt at appeal. I am unrepentant, and see no reason why I should not follow through the logic of that decision, now that what may or may not prove to be a judgment with which compliance can be enforced has been made, by making a parallel order against the husband personally to bolster the attempt to obtain what should be restored to the wife's depleted resources. M. Thiry has in the interim since March made plain in the passages from his emails which I have quoted how what may be nominally his daughters' companies are in reality his, and how he and they bear equal responsibility for what he regards as his and their liabilities, so that his word as his bond may be relied upon.</p>

The wife must give credit against my order for sums recovered towards the commercial judgment debt. She must undertake that the commercial judgment creditor will allow credit in respect of sums recovered in these proceedings, once my costs award has been met in full. And so far as these proceedings are concerned I shall direct that recoveries from the husband shall be applied first and until it has been fully satisfied to meet my costs award (including interest on any outstanding balances until payment).</p>

As it happens, upon the basis of the documentary evidence upon which my conclusions are based, the closest and most apt listed factor would be conduct on behalf of the husband which it would be inequitable to disregard. But the case has not been argued on that basis. It is much more, as I said at the beginning, a question of restorative rather than redistributive discretion which guides me. I cannot think of any consideration which would preclude me from ordering the husband to make good his protestations of good faith and willingness to take personal responsibility for his actions. </p>

I agree. The wife has both a &#8216;need' to take, and indeed the &#8216;responsibility' of taking, all appropriate steps, for their own benefit as much as for hers, to recover the children from the husband who has abducted them. That exercise will, I have no doubt, expose her to heavy financial expenditure. </p>

I view it as more likely than not, such is his animosity towards W and his determination that she should not receive more than whatever he would choose for her to receive, that H will carry out his threat of pattern-bombing W with litigation brought by him and his creatures. The cost of meeting those assaults should not deplete the other aspects of her award or invade what, in my view, is her fair entitlement. She will, moreover, most likely sustain some significant irrecoverable costs in seeking to enforce the order so as to obtain its fruits. Her difficulties will flow entirely from the stance and actions adopted by H in response to her legitimate claim. She should be shielded from what I understand Thorpe LJ, when rejecting his application for permission to appeal my June maintenance pending suit order, described as H's policy of poisoning the water and burning the crops as he retreats to havens fresh. That policy of waste should ricochet to his account, if W is ever so fortunate as to obtain full performance of the obligations which this order will impose on H. </p>
