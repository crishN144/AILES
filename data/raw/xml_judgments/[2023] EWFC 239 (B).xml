Care proceedings were issued due to Helen&#8217;s long-standing substance misuse problems, including an overdose during her pregnancy with Frank; her unstable mental health; and, her ability to safely parent her children.  Such was Helen&#8217;s chaotic lifestyle that her two older children had also been subject to care proceedings and had been removed from her care.  </p>

At that hearing Helen attended with Mr Buck, her counsel, and indicated that she wished to apply for leave to oppose the making of an adoption order.  At the same hearing Helen&#8217;s sister, Linda also attended and indicated that she wished to be reassessed as a carer for Frank.  It would appear that no formal application has ever actually been made, but despite this Her Honour Judge Jacklin K.C. set directions for Helen and Linda to provide witness evidence and for the local authority and the Guardian to respond.  The application was then re-listed before me on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2023.</p>

First, Helen averred there was a change in her circumstances in that her mental health was much more stable and that she was seeking help for her substance misuse addiction and had been abstinent for a number of months.  Secondly, Helen averred there had been a change in her sister Linda&#8217;s circumstances such that it warranted a re-assessment of Linda as an alternative carer for Frank.</p>

However, he contended that this did not preclude the Court&#8217;s consideration of whether or not there should be a reassessment of Linda.  Clearly Mr Buck is right about that, given the decision of Baker J. (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Re LG (Adoption: Leave to oppose)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2015/52" uk:canonical="[2015] EWFC 52" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWFC 52</ref>.

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">In addressing the second question, the judge must first consider and evaluate the parent&#8217;s ultimate prospects of success if given leave to oppose.  The key issue here (<span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S</span>, para 59) is whether the parent&#8217;s prospects of success are more than just fanciful, whether they have solidity.  If the answer to that question is no, that will be the end of the matter. &#8230; In evaluating the parent&#8217;s ultimate prospects of success if given leave to oppose, the judge has to remember that the child&#8217;s welfare is paramount and must consider the child&#8217;s welfare throughout his life.  In evaluating what the child&#8217;s welfare demands the judge will bear in mind what has happened in the past, the current state of affairs and what will or may happen in the future.  There will be cases, perhaps many cases, where, despite the change in circumstances, the demands of the child&#8217;s welfare are such as to lead the judge to the conclusion that the parent&#8217;s prospects of success lack solidity.  <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1146" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1146" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1146</ref> is a clear and telling example; so earlier was <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (A child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/431" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 431" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 431</ref>.</p>

The court must ask whether the welfare of the child will be so adversely affected by an opposed, in contrast to an unopposed, application that leave to oppose should be refused.  This is unlikely to be the situation in most case given that the court has, ex hypothesi, already concluded that the child&#8217;s welfare might ultimately best be served by refusing to make an order for adoption&#8230;&#8221;</p>

Mr Buck characterised this as Linda disengaging from Helen and that Linda&#8217;s perception of risk is good.  I cannot agree with this characterisation. It is Helen who has disengaged from Linda and her wider family.  Linda has not had to take any positive act to protect herself (and her children) from risks Helen presents.  Moreover, a theme of both Ms Norris and Ms Stollard&#8217;s assessments is to what extent Linda would be properly able to do so.  Both assessors doubted that Linda would be able to resist the pressure from family or, given her deep Catholic faith, turn her sister away.</p>

On the evidence available to me there is nothing new about Linda&#8217;s ability to protect Frank other than Linda&#8217;s witness statement that she would.  I accept that Linda settled her witness statement in good faith but her practical abilities to protect have never been tested.  In my judgment that is incapable of establishing that there has been a material change of circumstances of such a nature and degree that is sufficient to open the door to the court&#8217;s discretion.</p>

That must have impacted Frank&#8217;s ability to build a relationship with his aunt during those proceedings.  The inconsistency resulted in the last contact between Linda and Frank being on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2022.  After the care proceedings concluded, Linda did not respond to the local authority&#8217;s letter sent on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2022 offering her a final contact with Frank.  </p>

It was in a discussion with the local authority&#8217;s social worker on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2023 with the maternal grandmother, that the local authority shared that Frank&#8217;s prospective adopters were a same sex couple.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In respect of Frank&#8217;s ascertainable wishes and feelings, he is too young to express those or having any understanding of these proceedings.  I start from the position that any child would, if possible, want to be raised within their birth family and ideally by a parent.  The reality in this case however, is that Frank has no working memory of his birth family.  When the Guardian visited Frank and the Applicants on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2023 she found that Frank was well settled in his new home and she observed that Frank had a good bond and attachment to both applicants.  He demonstrated affection, responded to requests and was calm and engaged during that visit.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I also impute that a child would wish to have a stable home.  Frank has already experienced two significant losses in his young life: his mother at the beginning of the care proceedings and his foster carer when he was placed with the Applicants.  Those are two key attachment figures.  In my judgment it is reasonable to assume that Frank would not want to experience another loss or change.  I accept the Guardian&#8217;s analysis that although Frank would be glad to see that his birth family have fought for him to be cared for by them, on balance, he would prefer to remain in his forever home with his adoptive parents who provide him with extremely good care.</p>

He recently started attending nursery on a part-time basis which I am told he enjoys but has also found the separation from the applicants difficult.  This, of course, is normal for children of Frank&#8217;s age, and I have no evidence that deeper early life experiences have exacerbated this in Frank.</p>

Adoption can and does often provide for the adopted person all the security and stability that children require, but sometimes, often in later life, lead to an experience akin to loss or grief.  Some adopted people feel a sense of rejection and have poor self-esteem or other mental health difficulties.  Those experiences are rarely confined to the childhood and occur sporadically throughout the adopted person&#8217;s life, particularly at major &#8216;life events&#8217;.</p>

I was particularly touched by the fact that they articulated that they were grateful for Helen&#8217;s application for leave to oppose the adoption because they feel it strengthens the narrative they intend to give to Frank by explaining how loved and wanted he was by them.  Further, I was told during the hearing that the applicants are open to considering direct contact between Frank and his siblings in addition to their commitment to ongoing letterbox contact.</p>

That final threshold formed the basis for Recorder Honeyman&#8217;s order on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2022.  There was no appeal of Recorder Honeyman&#8217;s judgment.  Further, it seems to me that the risks that the learned Recorder identified in March 2022 in respect of Frank being placed in Helen&#8217;s care exist today given the events since 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2023.</p>

I have also concluded that even if I am wrong and that there has been some change in her circumstances they are neither material to the real issue of her ability to protect Frank from harm or of sufficient nature and degree that I should exercise my discretion and give leave.  I remain unclear why she did not commit to Frank during the care proceedings or appeal the assessments if she says they are incorrect.  Moreover, I accept the Guardian&#8217;s analysis that, Linda, whilst well-meaning, does not appear to have considered the impact that a re-assessment would have on Frank.</p>

I am not satisfied, when evaluating the evidence now available to me that the assessment landscape has changed and that Linda could provide Frank with a secure environment to develop.  Given his young age and the vulnerabilities he has I am not confident his needs will be prioritised and in my judgment Linda is likely to struggle if or when Helen re-engages with the family.</p>

The reality in this case is that Frank has had no direct contact with the maternal family since February 2022, he was then seventeen-months old.  He has no working memory of them.  </p>

The parties would then need to file their own evidence in response to that assessment, and the Court would need to list the application for determination.  The reality is that a contested adoption hearing would be unlikely to conclude in the next nine months, and in all probability take Frank beyond his fourth birthday.  In my judgment this further disruption and uncertainty, including the possibility of another change of carer, would be emotionally damaging for Frank.  I accept the Guardian&#8217;s assessment that this would likely to lead to a regression in all aspects of Frank&#8217;s development.</p>

Those negative aspects when combined with Linda&#8217;s lack of commitment to Frank throughout the care proceedings and since outweigh the positive factors.  When considering the circumstance that exist today and those that existed at the conclusion of the care proceedings I am not satisfied that there has been a change of circumstances.  Even if I am wrong about that, in my judgment those changes are too insignificant to be material changes to the most cogent risks, namely protection of Frank from harm, and also not of a sufficient nature and degree that I should exercise my discretion to grant leave to oppose.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I fully recognise that decision will be crushingly disappointing to Linda and the rest of the maternal family.  I cannot, however, escape Frank&#8217;s lived reality: he has been placed with the applicants for over a year, they are all he knows and he is receiving extremely good care from them.  If I were to have concluded that there had been a material change of circumstances of sufficient nature and degree I would still have to have considered whether or not to grant the application having considered <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> welfare checklist.  Having conducted that analysis for myself I consider that Frank is at a crucial age of development and his lifelong welfare demands he have permanence as to where his life will be.  His proceedings were already delayed by Ms Stollard&#8217;s assessment, and I conclude that it is unconscionable that he should suffer further delay and uncertainty for what would be at best a speculative re-assessment.  In short, even if Linda had satisfied me on the first limb of the <span style="font-style:italic">Re P</span> test, given my conclusions as to Frank&#8217;s welfare, I would have refused the application on the second limb.</p>
