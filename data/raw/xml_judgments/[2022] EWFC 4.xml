To get her parents&#8217; consent to the marriage (which was then required as she was under 21) she told everyone that Dennis was Ruth&#8217;s father, when she knew Patrick to be the father.

This silence was in part due to the societal implications of being an illegitimate child, even in the late 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century, and in part due to Ruth&#8217;s personal trauma suffered as a result of the revelation.

He explained to Ruth that he had previously tried to find Constance and the child he suspected they had had together, but had been untruthfully told by Constance&#8217;s family that she had emigrated to America. Patrick told Simon, his son (born in 1970), about Ruth and how he was certain she was his child. Patrick had by this point also spoken to Constance, who confirmed to him that she had been secretly pregnant, and that Ruth was his child. Soon thereafter, Ruth was introduced to Patrick&#8217;s children, her half-siblings, Simon and Jane (born in 1965) who embraced her as a sister. The three have shared a close relationship since. Patrick&#8217;s wife (Jane and Simon&#8217;s mother) Barbara was slightly slower to come around as she had never been told of the existence of Constance, but she now sees Ruth as family. </p>
