One of the facilities open to him was the opportunity to switch units from one fund to another within those policies in order to legitimately enhance returns.  On 20 December 1996, H took out a Capital Investment Bond Policy with FP, making a single premium investment of &#163;120,000: the assured lives being H and W, although the policy was in H's sole name.  From the commencement of this policy until 1 May 2003, H and W made a number of switches for which returns were achieved. The value of the Bond as at 1st May 2003 was &#163;501,170.33.</p>

The faxes were received either from the former matrimonial home, a property in France which the parties owned or two hotels.

At that hearing, a confiscation order was made against the H in the sum of his benefit i.e. &#163;4,812,245. A compensation order was made in favour of FP in the sum of their loss i.e. &#163;4,287,563 which is to be paid from the sum confiscated. The H was given six months to pay.  Accordingly, the questions of benefit, the value of that benefit, the amount to be recovered (the confiscation order) and the amount to be returned to the victim (the compensation order) are now settled, subject only to any application to vary the confiscation order.  It should be noted that the quantum of the confiscation order is wrongly set out on almost all of the documents submitted to this court.  The confiscation order made by the Crown Court as confirmed by the order before me is in the sum of &#163;4,812,245.</p>

The W lives in the former matrimonial home with the children.  At the time of the hearing the H was about to move to accommodation provided by a friend.  This was a 16 year marriage.  The children are both at school and I am told that they will each wish to move into tertiary education.

I hazard a guess that is why the Crown never pursued a case against her in the criminal courts.  For all that the Crown's position is entirely proper, and as a matter of public policy it is, in so far as it was an attempt to show that the W was tainted rather than the assets, it had all the appearance in fact of an expensive, adversarial and ultimately disproportionate exercise.  It became patently obvious from shortly after the W got into the witness box that she had not known of the H's fraud at the time he perpetrated it and that her knowledge of financial matters both generally and domestically was superficial and by and large obtained after the events upon which the Crown relied.  That would have been as obvious to the investigating officers as this court.  The W was a credible and reliable witness of her own lack of financial sophistication and her entire and unquestioning reliance on the H.  I find as a fact that she neither had knowledge of nor was complicit in the H's criminal activity.</p>

The H's investment behaviour was consistent throughout the relationship i.e. it was unchanged during the period of the fraud and it always produced legitimate income from which the family benefited.  Save for a short period the H was in addition always in well paid employment until he was arrested.  The standard of living was good without being excessive.  </p>

During that time the W assumed that the family outgoings were covered by their income. That would have been right if the rental from their UK property covered that property's outgoings and if the cost of living in France where education was free enabled them to live more modestly. In so far as she didn't know whether she was right or wrong, the point only went to emphasise the detached view she took of the family's finances.  It was not that she didn't care or that she deliberately turned a blind eye but rather that she trusted the H and what had always turned out well before, she expected to again. Even if I am wrong, the W's behaviour was no different than many caught up in a credit bubble: it was at worst an exercise in hope by someone who 'does not do' mental arithmetic.

The W did as she was asked by the H and that included signing a couple of the fax switch documents.  In so far as the Crown's case is that she signed many more, I accept her evidence and that of the H that he photocopied the blank forms that she had signed.  If that is right and the Crown did not satisfy me otherwise, then she had signed 2 documents in a period of 10 years.

I accept that this is a broad brush approach but it is consistent with the task which this court should undertake where tainted and untainted funds are necessarily intermingled and no party suggests that a detailed tracing exercise is appropriate.

	    <p class="jus" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in">Are there sufficient untainted assets to enable the transfer and lump sum payment to be made?  In my judgment there are.  I have decided that the former matrimonial home is untainted and that there is no argument to reduce the W's interest in it.  If I transfer it to her, she needs to be able to discharge a mortgage of just over &#163;307,000.  The untainted assets are the former matrimonial home, &#163;45,285.50 plus some interest arising out of the French property, the second property which has a net equity of &#163;164,476 and the tenanted property which has a net equity of &#163;80,025.  A lump sum reflecting the H's interests in those properties (&#163;162,263) together with the W's interest in the second property (&#163;82,238) and &#163;45,285.50 plus some interest i.e. &#163;289,786.50 together with the interest on the &#163;45,285.50 would achieve a just and equitable result and would be an appropriate balance between the Crown's interest and those of the W and the H and an appropriate balance of the rights in play.  </p>

He will retain sufficient assets to meet his compensation order such that the victim of his crimes is not prejudiced.  In the event that the H regains a level of earnings which justifies a contribution to the W then a nominal periodical payments order will permit such an application to be made.</p>
