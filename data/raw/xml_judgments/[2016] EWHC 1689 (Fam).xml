	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">These proceedings concern a young boy, D. D is aged 8. His parents are TR (&#8216;the mother&#8217;) and FP (&#8216;the father&#8217;). On 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April 2016 the father issued an application under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> seeking a child arrangements order, a prohibited steps order and a specific issue order. He subsequently issued an application for a return order. The purpose of this hearing is to determine a preliminary issue concerning the jurisdiction of the English court to adjudicate upon the father&#8217;s applications. That issue hinges on the court&#8217;s determination of whether, on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April 2016, D was habitually resident in England.</p>

It became apparent from the father&#8217;s oral evidence that that statement is not entirely accurate.

After the mother and D had relocated to France the father could have applied to the court for an order for D&#8217;s summary return to England. He did not do so.</p>

He continues to maintain that the removal was only intended to be temporary. At no time during the period from September 2013 to December 2015 did he ever come to the conclusion that &#8216;temporary&#8217; had become &#8216;permanent&#8217;. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The evidence points strongly to this being a permanent removal. A draft consent application and consent order were sent to the father by the mother&#8217;s solicitor. The father accepts that he received them. The draft order includes the following: &#8216;By consent it is ordered that: 1. The Mother shall have leave to remove the Child, D, to live permanently in France&#8217;. Although the draft application was never signed and filed at court, the inclusion of the word &#8216;permanent&#8217; made it very clear how the mother viewed the proposed relocation.</p>

I accept the mother&#8217;s evidence on that issue. I am satisfied that this was not and was not intended to be a temporary relocation.

A series of e-mails sent by the mother to the father on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March suggest that there may have been something seriously wrong with their relationship. Indeed, the tone of the mother&#8217;s e-mails suggests that she was very frightened. In her first e-mail she wrote &#8216;Plse can we talk tomorrow &#8211; he&#8217;s getting worse&#8217;. In a second e-mail a few minutes later she wrote, &#8216;if you don&#8217;t hear from me you will have to come here&#8217;.

Indeed, the mother and W are now engaged to be married. They got engaged in October 2014. They plan to marry in October 2016. The mother does not agree with the father&#8217;s description of the relationship as &#8216;volatile&#8217;. Their relationship is stable. </p>

At the same time he arranged for D to receive the triple MMR vaccine. Immunisation had been a bone of contention between the parents for some while.  The mother did not agree to D having the triple MMR vaccine. Although the GP was prepared to proceed on the basis of the father&#8217;s consent I am satisfied that the father knew that the mother did not consent and that he was acting unilaterally. It is clear that in taking that step the father soured the relationship between himself and the mother.

Sometimes the father collected him from France. What is very clear is that both parents were committed to maintaining the relationship between D and his father. Although the papers suggest that there were occasional strains in the relationship between the parents and notwithstanding the fact that the father was unable to achieve his objective of having in place a signed parenting agreement, the parents were for the most part able to work co-operatively in their parenting roles. The issue concerning immunisation is the most notable exception to that spirit of co-operation.</p>

It could perhaps be said that the mother&#8217;s decision to leave England in the way that she did is reflective more of the state of the relationship between the parents (in which the vaccination episode played an important part) than of a belief that she had no right to return to France and therefore needed to effect the move in a clandestine way.</p>

For example back in France I am able to rent a two bedroom cottage with a garden by the sea next to school for 600 euro per month compared to a 2 bedroom flat in Sussex for &#163;1600 per month with no garden. France offers a quality of life for D that is very hard to beat and one that he has grown accustomed to.

However, the Regulation does not lay down any minimum duration. Before habitual residence can be transferred to the host State, it is of paramount importance that the person concerned has it in mind to establish there the permanent or habitual centre of his interests, with the intention that it should be of a lasting character. Accordingly, the duration of a stay can serve only as an indicator in the assessment of the permanence of the residence, and that assessment must be carried out in the light of all the circumstances of fact specific to the individual case&#8230;</span></p>

The concept operates in the expectation that, when a child gains a new habitual residence, he loses his old one. Simple analogies are best: consider a see-saw. As, probably quite quickly, he puts down those first roots which represent the requisite degree of integration in the environment of the new state, up will probably come the child&#8217;s roots in that of the old state to the point at which he achieves the requisite de-integration (or, better, disengagement) from it.</p>

I noted earlier that on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2016 the mother&#8217;s previous solicitor wrote to the father inviting him to put forward proposals for improved financial provision for D and indicating that if he did not do so the mother would make an application to the court for financial provision for D pursuant to the provisions of Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. The question of law that arose was whether the mother needed to be habitually resident in England in order for the court to have jurisdiction to hear such an application. If habitual residence were required then, so the argument runs, even the threat of making such an application should be considered to be a relevant factor in determining the mother&#8217;s intent to remain in England and therefore to the question of whether the mother and D are now in fact habitually resident in England.</p>

The terms of Article 3 do not require both parents to live in the EC. What has to be established is either the defendant or the creditor being habitually resident in a Member State.

She there makes the point that physical presence is not an essential prerequisite to establishing habitual residence in a particular State and that habitual residence &#8216;is not lost by temporary absences&#8217;. My concern about that passage is that the two illustrations there given &#8211; a mother giving birth while on holiday abroad or a mother on the run from a Slovakian children&#8217;s home &#8211; both suggest that &#8216;temporary&#8217; also means &#8216;short&#8217;.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In this case I am satisfied that by December 2015 D&#8217;s life was deeply integrated in France and that he had acquired a degree of permanence there. There is no evidence of the mother having engaged in actual pre-planning of the move to England before she and D arrived here. Such limited arrangements as she made (accommodation and schooling) both seem to have been made after she and D arrived in England. It is clear that the &#8216;central members of the child&#8217;s life in the old state&#8217; &#8211; W and D&#8217;s pet, Charlie &#8211; remain in France as do most of his clothes and toys.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I come to the conclusion that, ultimately, the decision about whether a child has gained or lost habitual residence in a particular State is quintessentially fact-specific. In arriving at its decision the court must take account of all of the relevant circumstances of the particular case, of which length of presence is only one, assessed in the light of the guidance set out in the authorities. In this case I conclude that, taken cumulatively, the factors set out in &#167;94 above are stronger than those set out in &#167;93. Having regard to the totality of the evidence in this case I am satisfied that at the time when D returned to France on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April 2016 he retained habitual residence in France. The father&#8217;s applications are therefore dismissed.</p>
