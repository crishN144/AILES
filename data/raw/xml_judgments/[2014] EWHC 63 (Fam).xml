She had a young child, HL, who was born on 28.09.10 and is 3 years of age. These care proceedings concern her future welfare.

It is something of which I complained almost thirteen years ago: see&#160;Re S (Ex Parte Orders)&#160;<ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 FLR 308" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 FLR 308</ref>. Perhaps what I say as President will carry more weight than what I said when the junior puisne. I refer to the slapdash, lackadaisical and on occasions almost contumelious attitude which still far too frequently characterises the response to orders made by family courts. There is simply no excuse for this. Orders, including interlocutory orders, must be obeyed and complied with&#160;to the letter&#160;and&#160;on time. Too often they are not. They are not preferences, requests or mere indications; they are orders: see&#160;Re W (A Child)</span><a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/1227.html" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0000FF">[2013] EWCA Civ 1227</a><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">, para 74.

		      <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">"It is the plain and unqualified obligation of every person against, or in respect of whom, an order is made by a court of competent jurisdiction, to obey it unless and until that order is discharged. The uncompromising nature of this obligation is shown by the fact that it extends even to cases where the person affected by an order believes it to be irregular or even void."</span></p>

The court is entitled to expect &#8211; and from now on family courts will demand &#8211; strict compliance with all such orders. Non-compliance with orders should be expected to have and will usually have a consequence. &#8230; A person who finds himself unable to comply timeously with his obligations under an order should apply for an extension of time&#160;before the time for compliance has expired. It is simply not acceptable to put forward as an explanation for non-compliance with an order the burden of other work.&#8230;. Non-compliance with an order, any order, by anyone is bad enough. It is a particularly serious matter if the defaulter is a public body such as a local authority.</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221;</span></p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">&#8220;</span>In the first place, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/98/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 98(2)</ref> gives protection only against the use of such statement or admission "in evidence." It does not, for example, protect against use in a police inquiry into the commission of an offence: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re C (A Minor) (Care Proceedings: Disclosure)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] Fam 76" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] Fam 76</ref> at page 85. So it does not, in my judgment, protect the Defendant from disclosure of the documents to the CPS in the manner and for the purpose that is here contemplated. Moreover, given the limitations and conditions upon the use of the documents (and the information contained in them) imposed by my order, the documents cannot be used against the Defendant in open court without the prior sanction of the family court. Given that the Crown Court sits in public, it is therefore difficult to see how they can be used "in evidence" against him without a further order of the family court having first been obtained. Furthermore, the order which I propose to make specifically confines the use of the documents to the present criminal proceedings, so they cannot be used by the CPS for any purpose in connection with any future criminal proceedings. Secondly, it is to be noted that putting inconsistent statements to a witness in order to challenge his evidence or attack his credibility does not amount to using those statements "against" him within the meaning of the section: <span style="font-style:italic">Kent County Council v K </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 1 WLR 912" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 1 WLR 912</ref> at page 916 followed in <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (Care: Confidentiality) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 FLR 165" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 FLR 165</ref> at page 167. Thirdly, and finally, it is of course ultimately for the judge in the Crown Court who is conducting the criminal proceedings, and not for the judge in the family court who is conducting the family proceedings, to decide whether or not and to what extent <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/98/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 98(2)</ref> applies in any particular situation. And in this connection, as Johnson J pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (Care: Confidentiality) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 FLR 165" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 FLR 165</ref> at page 168, "It would clearly be wrong for a judge hearing care proceedings to make any order that might be thought to trespass on the jurisdiction of the judge conducting the criminal trial." </p>

He told me the father would not suffer any prejudice in the criminal proceedings if I made that order. Further, he submitted that there was no basis upon which he, on behalf the father&#8217;s criminal team, could resist such an order.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The conduct of the parties in this matter and the wholesale failure to comply with case management directions is lamentable. Family practitioners must wake up to the fact that, whatever the difficulties presented by public funding issues and/or the pressure of work, the court will no longer tolerate the failure of parties to comply timeously with court orders. Those failures simply lead to unacceptable delays in the proceedings which are wholly inimical to the welfare of the children involved.</p>
