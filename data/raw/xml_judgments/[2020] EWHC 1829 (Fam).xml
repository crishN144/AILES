Before dealing with the detail I would like to echo the part of the submissions on behalf of the Children&#8217;s Guardian that paid tribute to the enormous progress the child has made in the placement. The evidence demonstrates the great benefits to the child&#8217;s physical and psychological welfare from the stability of the placement.   </p>

The second question relates to the concept of adoption for the word itself can bear many shades of meaning from the idea of complete substitution of adopted family for natural family at one end of the spectrum through to an idea much more closely akin to our concept of Special Guardianship. Clearly the English court should not be recognising (and thus giving effect to) a foreign adoption unless what was conferred by that order is substantially the same as would be conferred by an English order. The third question relates to matters that would be repugnant to our jurisdiction as, for example, if what in reality was involved was the buying and selling of children irrespective of their actual welfare needs.&#8217; </span></p>

This distinction, which may appear somewhat pedantic, is in fact very important. For public policy in this context has a strictly limited function and is, in my judgment, properly confined to particularly egregious cases, as explained, compellingly and correctly, in the passage from Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins, The Conflict of Laws, ed 15, 2012, para 20-133.

But, apart from exceptional cases like these, it is submitted that the court should be slow to refuse recognition to a foreign adoption on the grounds of public policy merely because the requirements for adoption in the foreign law differ from those of the English law. Here again the distinction between recognizing the status and giving effect to its results is of vital importance. Public policy may sometimes require that a particular result of a foreign adoption should not be given effect to in England; but public policy should only on the rarest occasions be invoked in order to deny recognition to the status itself." </span></p>

The world has indeed changed since 1965, and with it the world of intercountry adoption. The ease of international travel has made adoption from overseas more available, with all its benefits and possible pitfalls. The Hague Convention and the overseas adoption procedure are mechanisms that increase confidence that standards are maintained. The same confidence cannot always be felt in relation to adoptions effected in countries that are not Convention signatories, and the importance for child welfare of following approved procedures in these cases is consequently the greater.&#8221; </span></p>

Article 8 provides the criteria for children to be eligible for adoption. Applicants are required to submit their requests to the Welfare Organisation, where they are examined to see if they meet the requirements. If they do, they are added to the waiting list to receive a child. When a child is identified who is considered suitable the Welfare Organisation prepare a report and send it along with documents in support of the application to a court for issuing a temporary adoption order. The court considers the legal requirements, the report and formal assessment from the Welfare Organisation and issues an order for a trial period of six months. Following the trial period the court considers the Welfare Organisation&#8217;s assessment plus conditions provided for by Articles 14 (applicants to assign part of their assets/property to the adopted child, amount to be determined by the court for the purpose to protect and support the adopted child financially in case of losing his/her adoptive parents) and 15 (reassurances by the applicants to provide necessary long term commitment to provide for the child).  </p>

The world has indeed changed since 1965, and with it the world of intercountry adoption. The ease of international travel has made adoption from overseas more available, with all its benefits and possible pitfalls. The Hague Convention and the overseas adoption procedure are mechanisms that increase confidence that standards are maintained. The same confidence cannot always be felt in relation to adoptions effected in countries that are not Convention signatories, and the importance for child welfare of following approved procedures in these cases is consequently the greater. </span></p>

It is possible to apply to revoke adoption orders here; they are not immune from challenge although he accepts such applications being permitted are uncommon.

In this particular case to seek to use Article 8 in the way suggested would mean that if the declaration is made and the Iranian adoption recognised here as if it was made here would result in two significant differences: (1) the biological father&#8217;s legal relationship with the child would be severed, whereas in Iran it would remain, and (2) the biological parents and the paternal grandfather&#8217;s right to apply to revoke the order in Iran would be viewed very differently in this jurisdiction. </p>

Whilst it is correct, as Mr Powell submits, it requires an application to the court and therefore some scrutiny, the legal framework under which that is done is very different as it operates with a much lower threshold for revoking the order. For example, if the applicants are in breach of any of the conditions in Article 6 which includes matters such as financial means, physical health and character. Also, if the application is by the biological parents or the paternal grandfather and they can prove they meet the requirements to take responsibility of the child. This framework could not be described as limiting applications to revoke the adoption order as being only in highly exceptional and very particular circumstances, they are more akin to a general welfare reappraisal.  </p>

It is right that if the court refuses to make the declaration those rights are interfered with, particularly where an adoptive parent(s), as a British citizen, would be unable to come to apply to the SSHD for the child to join them with the benefit of such a declaration having been made. The real question is whether this interference is justified and a key consideration in evaluating that is whether there is no other remedy. In my judgment, unlike in <span style="font-style:italic">QS v RS,</span> there is another remedy. S 49(3) ACA provides one of the gateway requirements for an adoption application in this jurisdiction is twelve months habitual residence, which could readily be established by the adoptive parent(s). An application could be made under the relevant Immigration Rules for the child to come here and the SSHD in considering that application is required to consider Article 8. Whilst of course a matter for the SSHD, but there is powerful evidence to support the Article 8 rights of the adoptive parent(s) and the child being maintained.  </p>

For example, the effect here would be to sever the legal relationship with the biological father, which expressly can&#8217;t be done in Iran. Mr Powell&#8217;s reliance on the facts of this case that the biological parents are not known does not assist with the point of principle when looking at recognition of orders between two jurisdictions.
