Without such protection those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from revealing such information of a person and intimidate nature as may be necessary in order to receive appropriate treatment and even from seeking such assistance, thereby endangering their own health and, in the case of transmittable diseases, that of the community.&#8221;&#8221;</span></p>

		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8220;It is appropriate to bear in mind that the European Court of Human Rights attaches great value to the rights of children.  Furthermore, the ratification by the United Kingdom of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in November 1989 was significantly showing a desire to give children greater rights.  The ECHR and the UNC show why the duty of confidence owed by a medical professional to a competent young person is a high one and which therefore should not be overridden except for a very powerful reason.  In my view, although family factors are significant and cogent, they should not override the duty of confidentiality owed to the child.  It must  not be forgotten that this duty was described in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Z v  Finland</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> as a vital principle in the legal system of all Contracting Parties to the Convention.&#8221;  </span></p>

In considering this  issue, it must always be remembered first, that in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Z v Finland</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> the European Court emphasised the significance and compelling nature of a patient&#8217;s Article 8(1) right to confidentiality of health information as explained in paragraph 63 above.  A similar approach was adopted in MS v Sweden, in which it is said at page 337 in paragraph 41 &#8220;respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all Contracting Parties to the Convention&#8221;.  Although these cases deal with the position of an adult there is no good reason why they could not apply to protect the confidentiality of health information concerning a young person, especially because, as I have explained, that a duty of confidentiality is owed to a young person by medical professionals.&#8221;  </span></p>

	      <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		  <level>
		    <content>
		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8220;As a matter of principle it is difficult to see why a parent should still retain an Article 8 right to parental authority relating to a medical decision where the young person concerned understands the advice provided by the medical professionals and its implications.  Indeed, any right under Article 8 of a parent to be notified of advice or treatment of a sexual matter as part of the right claimed by Mr. Havers must depend on a number of factors, such as the age and understanding of their offspring.  A parent would not be able to claim such an Article 8 right to be notified if their son or daughter was, say, 18 years of age and had sought medical advice on sexual matters, because in that case the young person is able to consent without parental knowledge or consent for the reasons set out in paragraph 1 above.  The reason why the parent could not claim such a right is that their right to participate in decision making as part of the right claimed by Mr. Havers would only exist while the child was so immature that his parent had the right of control as was made clear in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Gillick</span><span style="font-size:14pt">.  In my view, any Article 8 right of the kind advocated by Mr. Havers must be seen in that light so that once the child is sufficiently mature in this way the parent only retains such rights to family life and to be notified about medical treatment if, but only if, the young person so wishes.  Indeed, whether there is family life and hence a right to family life of a particular family is a question of fact.  The European Commission on Human Rights has explained the existence of family ties depends upon the real existence and practice of close family ties.  It is not clear why the parent should have an Article 8 right to a family life where first the offspring is almost 16 years of age and does not wish it, second where the parent no longer has a right to control the child for the reasons set out in the last paragraph and third where the young person, in Lord Scarman&#8217;s words, &#8220;has sufficient understanding of what is involved to give a consent valid in law&#8221;.  There is nothing in the Strasbourg jurisprudence which persuades me that any parental right or power of control under Article 8 is wider than in domestic law.  Parental right to family life does not continue after the time when the child is able to make his own decisions.  So parents do not have Article 8 rights to be notified of any advice of the medical profession after the young person is able to look after himself or herself and make his or her own decisions.&#8221;</span></p>
