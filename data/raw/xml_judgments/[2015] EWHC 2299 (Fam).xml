	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applications before the Court concern NH; he was born in October 1999 and is 15 years old.  The applications have been brought by the London Borough of Sutton for orders under the inherent jurisdiction (issued 12 May 2015), and/or a public law order under <span style="font-style:italic">Part IV </span>of the <span style="font-style:italic">Children Act 1989</span> (issued 14 May 2015).  The unusual circumstances in which these applications have been brought require me, by way of preliminary adjudication in accordance with the guidance given by Sir James Munby P in <span style="font-style:italic">Re E (A Child) (Care Proceedings: European Dimension)&#160;</span>[2014] EWHC 6 (Fam), [2014] 1 WLR 2670<span style="font-style:italic">, sub nom&#160;Re E (Brussels II Revised: Vienna Convention: Reporting Restrictions)</span>&#160;[2014] 2 FLR 151, FD, (and see also, for its general application: <span style="font-style:italic">Purrucker&#160;v Vall&#233;s P&#233;rez (No 1) Case C-256/09</span> &#160;[2011] Fam 254;&#160;[2011] 3 WLR 982; [2012] 1 FLR 903), to determine whether the English Court has jurisdiction.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This reasoned judgment leads to the conclusion that the English Court does have jurisdiction.  I have concluded on the evidence that it is not possible to establish NH&#8217;s habitual residence; jurisdiction is founded merely upon NH&#8217;s physical presence in England.  I recognise that I am, in these circumstances, exercising a &#8220;jurisdiction of necessity&#8221; (as it is so described by Paul Lagarde in his 1997 Explanatory Report to the <span style="font-style:italic">1996 Child Protection Convention</span>, see [45]) enabling me to make substantive orders in relation to NH.  I readily acknowledge that NH&#8217;s connections with England are tenuous and, according to NH&#8217;s Guardian, NH enjoys no &#8220;affinity&#8221; with this country.  My conclusion follows, however, a careful review and application of the key provisions of the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention of 19 October 1996 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-Operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children</span> (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the 1996 Child Protection Convention</span>&#8221;).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before descending into the factual and legal detail, I summarise the outcome and my essential reasoning.  NH is a national of Canada and Zimbabwe. He has lived an unsettled life; he has not attended any school for more than one year.  For the last three years he has lived in Switzerland, though has been educated during that period in residential schools in both Zimbabwe and Germany. He has spent two months this year in residential care in Zurich.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 25 April 2015, NH travelled to this jurisdiction on a flight from Zurich; on arrival here, he was met by relatives with whom he stayed briefly in the Midlands before heading to other relatives in South London.  Three days after his arrival, his mother, AH (&#8220;the mother&#8221;), joined him, also travelling here from Zurich.  The mother had intended that NH would, within a few days or weeks of his arrival here, travel onwards from England to South Africa and then Zimbabwe, to attend a therapeutic clinic and residential boarding school. NH was (and is) adamantly opposed to this outcome and had (has) no intention of complying with his mother&#8217;s wishes.  NH believed he was merely in England on holiday, though accepted that he would not be returning to live in Switzerland largely because his residence permit (&#8216;B-Permit&#8217; or <span class="Emphasis">Aufenthaltsbewilligung</span>) had expired there and had not been renewed.  His mother had indeed taken the step of de-registering him as a resident, thus comprehensively extinguishing his right of residence there.  Although the mother had successfully applied for a Schengen visa for herself (though not for NH), her application for an extension of that visa has been refused, and she is required to leave Switzerland by 10 September 2015.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The jurisdiction of the Court was invoked following an incident on 8 May 2015, when the police were called to the home at which NH and his mother were staying in the area of the London Borough of Sutton (&#8220;the local authority&#8221;).  NH alleged that he had been assaulted by his mother.  The mother was arrested, and NH was taken into police protection, and placed in foster care.  When the mother (although bailed, with a condition to have no contact with NH) withheld her agreement to NH&#8217;s continued placement in foster care, the local authority sought to initiate proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court.  On 13 May 2015, Roderic Wood J declined the relief sought under the inherent jurisdiction (given the provisions of <span style="font-style:italic">section 100</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic">Children Act 1989</span>), but made an interim care order under <span style="font-style:italic">section 38 </span>of the <span style="font-style:italic">Children Act 1989 </span>in respect of NH (a formal application for an order under <span style="font-style:italic">Part IV</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic">Children Act 1989</span> followed on the next day).  Given the obvious uncertainties over jurisdiction, this order was made for a time-limited period expressly pursuant to the emergency powers vested in the court under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 11 </span>of the <span style="font-style:italic">1996 Child Protection Convention</span>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue of substantive jurisdiction was then listed for determination following further case management directions given at a hearing on 26 June 2015; that case management order included a direction that the local authority should obtain clarification from the Swiss Central Authority &#8220;whether they consider [NH] to have habitual residence in Switzerland or to have no habitual residence&#8221;, and whether they would &#8220;readmit [NH] into their care&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied that this is the first realistic stage in these proceedings at which a Court could reach an informed view about jurisdiction.  I have been assisted by Ms Lucey and Mr Barda for the local authority and NH respectively; NH has actually been present in court for much of the hearing.  The mother has not attended this hearing, though she has communicated extensively with the Court and the parties by e-mail over the course of the two days, conveying her views in the clearest terms, and presenting documents in both English and German which she wishes me to consider.  I am wholly satisfied that she is aware of this hearing and its purpose.  She has had publicly-funded lawyers acting for her here, but has recently terminated their instruction.  The documents generated in these proceedings have been served on the Zimbabwean Embassy, the Canadian Embassy, the Swiss Embassy in London and the Swiss Central Authority; none of these bodies has sought to make representations.</p>

NH&#8217;s father (TT) has, so far as I am aware, played no part in NH&#8217;s life; it is not known whether he has parental responsibility for NH.  Efforts are currently being made to locate him.

In 2004, NH together with his half-sister and mother moved to Canada, where they remained for eight years.  In 2012, NH and his mother moved to Switzerland, where the mother married a Swiss national; the marriage did not in fact last more than a couple of years, and the mother is now divorced.  In the following year (2013), NH was sent to boarding school in Zimbabwe; he remained there for an academic year, albeit returning to Switzerland (apart from one holiday when he travelled to Australia) for the school holidays.  He then attended boarding school in Germany for a period; latterly he has been at a day school in Zurich.  </p>

In February 2015, NH moved to reside temporarily at the &#8216;Schlupfhuuse&#8217; in Zurich at his mother&#8217;s instigation; the Schlupfhuus offers residential care to a limited number of young people (aged 13-18) for a maximum of three months together with a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Beratungsstelle</span>&#8221; (advice centre) and a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Krisenwohngruppe</span>&#8220; (crisis residential centre).

Furthermore the youth suffers years of domestic violence and has been examined several times medically and psychologically.  The youth wanted to remain in Switzerland, complete his schooling and finish some training, because he was no longer prepared today to have the centre of his life moved for the umpteenth time upon the whim of his mother&#8221;.</p>

Due to a lack of an actual center of his life in Switzerland and a focus of relationships in Switzerland, we are unable to determine [NH]&#8217;s habitual residence.  Therefore according to Article 6(2) of the Hague Convention for the protection of children, the Contracting State on the territory of which the child is present has the jurisdiction.

It is not a matter of intention: one does not acquire a habitual residence merely by intending to do so; nor does one fail to acquire one merely by not intending to do so. An illegal immigrant may desperately want to become habitually resident in this country, but that does not mean that he does so. A tax exile may desperately want to lose his habitual residence here, but that does not mean that he does so.

Sometimes I would crash with my friends at their house at weekends or we would hang out or go to the cinema &#8211; the usual stuff that people my age do.&#8221;</p>

I see no justification for a refusal even to consider evidence of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">her own state of mind</span> during the period of her residence there. Her mind may &#8211; possibly &#8211; have been in a state of rebellious turmoil about the home chosen for her which would be inconsistent with any significant degree of integration on her part. In the debate in this court about the occasional relevance of this dimension, references have been made to the "wishes" "views" "intentions" and "decisions" of the child. But, in my opinion, none of those words is apt. What can occasionally be relevant to whether an older child shares her parent's habitual residence is her <span style="font-style:italic">state of mind</span> during the period of her residence with that parent.&#8221; (emphasis by underlining added; emphasis by italics in the original).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Through her extensive written representations, which I have read with care, the mother passionately argues that NH is habitually resident in Zimbabwe and that &#8220;it is now the responsibility of Zimbabwe to make long term arrangements for him&#8221;.  Her case appears essentially to be founded upon a combination of (a) NH&#8217;s Zimbabwean nationality, and (b) her intention that NH should move now to live there.  Neither of these points supports a finding of habitual residence, and I unhesitatingly reject her submission.  Although a national of Zimbabwe, NH has never lived there, and has spent relatively little of his life there, indeed only when in residential school.  I am clear that he is not habitually resident there, nor has he &#8211; on the information which I have received &#8211; ever been so. For the avoidance of doubt, I also reject any argument that the Canadian courts should exercise substantive welfare-based jurisdiction, given that NH last lived there more than three years ago, and he is plainly not habitually resident there either.   It is perfectly clear on the evidence (and no-one argues otherwise) that NH is not habitually resident in England; he arrived here in late April, on any view only temporarily; on his mother&#8217;s case, he was only in transit between Switzerland and Zimbabwe.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority vacillated in the presentation of its case, urging on me variously that I could/should conclude on the facts that NH is habitually resident in Switzerland, and alternately that it was not possible for me to establish NH&#8217;s habitual residence.  When the former argument was advanced, this caused me to consider carefully with counsel at the hearing the &#8216;transfer in&#8217; provisions of <span style="font-style:italic">Article 9</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic">1996 Child Protection Convention</span> (read alongside the provisions of <span style="font-style:italic">Article 8(2)</span> ibid.); these transfer provisions are in different terms to those set out in the more familiar <span style="font-style:italic">Article 15</span> of <span style="font-style:italic">BIIa</span>.   Ms Lucey acknowledged that if on the facts NH were indeed habitually resident in Switzerland, it would be difficult to mount a case for transfer of jurisdiction to this country (which would not, on these facts, fall into one of the specific criteria listed in <span style="font-style:italic">Article 8(2)</span>).   Mr. Barda, while highlighting NH&#8217;s own perception of his habitual residence (in Switzerland), nonetheless recognised realistically the difficulties for the court in reaching a conclusion which was consistent with NH&#8217;s personal view.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">On my reading of the materials, there was a high degree of instability in NH&#8217;s life when he was residing in Switzerland.  This instability may not have prevented him from integrating into a life in Switzerland to a sufficient &#8216;degree&#8217; (see Lady Hale&#8217;s test quoted at [28] above) to acquire or maintain habitual residence there prior to April 2015; indeed I believe he probably did so integrate.  However, it seems to me that where integration is founded upon connections with a country which are of relatively recent origin and are inherently fragile, the &#8216;degree&#8217; of integration will be less than that which is established by long-standing and robust connections; they are accordingly likely to be more easily dismantled.  In this regard, I have in mind that NH was not fluent in the German language (though he indicates that &#8220;there is not much that I don&#8217;t understand or can&#8217;t say&#8221;); his schooling had taken place for extended periods away from Switzerland; when with his mother he had lived at more than one address in Zurich, and latterly had lived in residential care. As I indicated when announcing my decision at the conclusion of the hearing on 22 July, his habitual residence in Switzerland appeared to &#8216;hang by a thread&#8217; even before his right of residence was finally terminated by his mother on 26 April 2015;</p>
