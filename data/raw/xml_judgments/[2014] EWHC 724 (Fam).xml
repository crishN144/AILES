It seeks the order to last two years from today.   The authority is also seeking non-molestation and restraining orders against mother to protect X and her father, and an exclusion zone in the area of her home and her current school, her prospective future school, and her grandmother&#8217;s home where she spends considerable periods.  Such order to last for two years.  Finally it is seeking a Section 91(14) order against the mother from issuing any further application under the Children Act in respect of X for a period of three years.  It is a permissive order, a filter order, so that if the mother for whatever reason wished to make an application in respect of X she would have first to come to court to ask for leave and the court could then consider whether leave should be given or not.  </span></p>

The father is not present.  He was aware of these applications when they were initially made last summer and he was understood then to be in support of the applications and of the orders being made.  The mother, who represents herself today with the help of a Mackenzie friend, opposes them.  I should add that she has applied for legal aid but that was refused and her appeal against that refusal was also rejected.  The mother has provided a lot of documents which I have read, and very recently a tablet upon which there was a letter from the Probation Service, which I have read.  She is articulate; educated; although may feel inadequate representing herself she is far from inadequate; she is articulate and can express herself easily although she may find it a strain.  I certainly have listened to what she has had to say with great care.  Fundamentally the mother does not understand and can see no reason why she cannot see her daughter.  She believes that no contact is not in her daughter&#8217;s interests and is detrimental to her and contrary to her and her own Human Rights and respect for family life, and contrary to the interests of her own younger child who is X&#8217;s half-sister.  </span></p>

I have already referred to the reporting restriction which remains in being and I know that the ladies of the Press who are present have heard and I hope have understood what that means, that whatever I say the order is still standing and that the child is not to be identified.  </span></p>

By the end of that year the mother was making the first allegations of sexual abuse against the father.  Since then she has made and there have been a series of allegations against him, all of which have been taken seriously and indeed the child started making allegations as well.  Private Law litigation started in 2006.  X was then not three and litigation continued for a number of years in the Private Law parent conflict.  </span></p>

A care order was ultimately made and after a full hearing with full assessments of both parents the child was placed with the father under a care order and she has been with him ever since.  She has done well.  I am told she is settled, she is happy, doing well at school and educationally bright.  However, there has been no contact.  Supervised contact was offered to the mother but she declined to have supervised contact and as a result there has been no contact.  </span></p>

The possibility of contact with her maternal family has been posed with her by myself and my predecessor.  This has been done alone with her and when her father is present.

X said she knew this, however stated she just wanted things the way they are now and was happy.&#8217;  </span></p>

They included three small gift bags, two with visible gifts, which were a teddy bear and one a small knitted dog.  The other contained books and a photograph of her mother with her younger sister.  X was alone with the social worker when attempts were made to show her these gifts and she was very clear in her views about them.  She did not present as upset in any way but stated that she did not want the gifts.  The social worker assured X that the gifts and cards had been looked at and they contained best wishes for her birthday.  One card was from her maternal grandmother and one from her half-sister, written by her mother, with some scribbles on it by the child, and one from her own mother.  X again stated she did not want to have them.  She was reassured that there was no right or wrong answer but she needed to say how she felt.  The social worker said that sometimes people change their minds when something is very emotional and personal to them and suggested that she left the gifts with her paternal grandmother and she could look at them at a later date should she change her mind.  The grandmother was present at the time and she was willing and able to do this.  X said she did not want the items and would not change her mind; that she did not want them at her grandmother&#8217;s either.  She stated: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;I have a suggestion.

The grandmother said that no one would be angry with her if she wanted to know about her sister and wanted to be in contact with her mother and maternal family.  X said that she knew this; she did not want this as she is happy.  X was then left alone to speak with the social worker, who asked her if she thinks about the past and X said she does not really any more.  She volunteered that &#8220;the best thing was living with Daddy; that is awesome; she was happy and wished for things to stay the same.&#8221;  She was again reassured she could change her mind or have any questions or wish to see any family member that she should ask her father, social worker, talk to her teacher or to her grandmother or her paternal grandmother.  X was very clear that she knew this and understood.  </span></p>

The social worker went to visit her and they had a quiet chat with grandmother.  The social worker said that X answered the door, appeared to be very cheerful and happy to see her, asking her if she would like to come in; she was excited and wanted to show the presents she had received for Christmas.  X talked about her plans for high school; she wishes to go to Roman Catholic school in the area which requires an 11-plus exam, and that she is aware that she has to work hard.  She then referred to a sports event that she had been invited to and that made her pleased and rather proud.  The social worker told X that she (the social worker) would have to go to the court considering the orders and asked X what she felt about this.  X had previously felt that she would feel better if such orders were in place.  X again stated that she would prefer them to be there as she did not want anything in her life to change.  The social worker shared with X that very soon in February the measures that were in place in terms of preventing her mother coming into the village where she lives or the neighbouring towns or villages where her school is or where her grandmother lives would no longer be in place, and would enable her mother to enter those areas.  She asked X what she felt about this and X&#8217;s presentation and demeanour which was previously cheerful clearly changed.  She answered quickly, saying she would be very scared.  Her head was held low, she no longer presented as wishing to engage in conversation openly and confidently.  The social worker asked X why she would be scared and X answered, stating that she would be worried that if her mother was able to come into the village as her mother might make attempts to take her away again like she did from the petrol station there, and also that her mother tried to stop her from living with her father.  The social worker discussed with X what she would do and how she would feel if she were, for example, to be in a shop in the village and her mother came into the shop.  X again stated that she would be scared but that she would be okay as she would be with someone.  She said she would stay close to the adult she was with and ask to leave the shop.  X did say this would be very different if she was on her own at any point as this may happen when she gets older such as when she goes to the senior school.  She again stated she just wanted things to remain the same, that she just wishes to remain with her father.</span></p>

Imagine what it is like for a little girl aged 10 to come to court, give evidence in front of a number of people, her mother would be there asking questions, and it would be deeply upsetting and distressing for this little girl partly to be dragged all the way to London but much more, how would she feel aged 10 having to say you do not want to see your mother in front of your mother?  It would be totally inappropriate.  It indicated to me mother&#8217;s lack of insight into what is needed for this little girl.  She wanted the little girl to be assessed by a child psychologist as to her views which she has held over a long period.  Again I thought this is inappropriate.  There is absolutely no need.  She has expressed her clear views to her social worker, who has encouraged her and reassured her that she could accept gifts; that she could look at photographs; she could ask to see members of the family.  It is clear that at the moment and for a long period this little girl has not wanted that contact.  </span></p>

X expressed to the local authority social worker that she was frightened even of an accidental meeting, frightened that she might be removed from her father, and she wanted the orders in place.  The exclusion zone has been reduced in size from what the prohibition zone has been.  It is smaller and I have discussed it at length in the presence of the mother.  It is intended to keep the mother away from the village in which the child lives; and from the area in which her primary school is; and to put a smaller zone around the potential high school in the neighbouring town, and a small zone around the paternal grandmother&#8217;s home, again in another village.  The mother says that to exclude her from the area which has been described by the postal code area is an inconvenience and an intrusion into her daily life.  She lives about four or five miles south of the area; she has members of her family living within the exclusion zone; she has friends there; her partner goes there for their little girl; and on occasions she would like to be able to drive through the area rather than skirting it in order to go to another major town for whatever reason that may include her GP.  As I say, it is a greatly reduced area and it is there to protect X and to give X some peace of mind, and that is what she needs.  </span></p>

If she could come to understand that her way of thinking needs to change then the situation might change.  In the meanwhile I have to make the orders in order to protect this child from this mother.  Section 34(4) order gives the local authority permission to cease contact or ensure there is no contact if that is in the best interests of the child.  It is permissive.  The local authority would be able to allow some kind of indirect contact or direct contact if it were right for the child.
