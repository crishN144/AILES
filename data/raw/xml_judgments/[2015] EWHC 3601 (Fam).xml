It arises against a background of precisely the same kind of administrative incompetence by a fertility clinic as was described by the President in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Embryology and Fertilisation Act 2008</ref> (Cases A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H)</span><span style="font-style:italic"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/2602" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 2602 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 2602 (Fam)</ref>. </span>But the surrounding circumstances of this case are very different to those litigated before the President earlier this year. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this instance, there was a substantial dispute between the parents as to the appropriate Children Act orders which should be made in relation to the child. There had also been a live issue as to whether a declaration of parentage should be made in favour of or against the father, F. By her application the child&#8217;s mother, M, sought a declaration that F is not the father of C. F applied for a declaration that he is. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Very shortly before the hearing began, Ms Cover on behalf of M, conceded that F should be declared as the father of the child. But that, very obviously, was not the end of the matter. As the President said in the <span style="font-style:italic">Re HFEA Act 2008 </span>judgment<span style="font-style:italic">, </span>&#8220;it is elementary that a declaration cannot be granted by consent or default. There must be a proper examination of the facts, assessed in the light of the applicable law, before a judge can be satisfied, as he must be if the relief sought is to be granted, that the claim for the declaration is indeed made out: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Wallersteiner v.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the course of my separate Children Act judgment delivered on 30 November, I said I would be able to find unequivocally that F is entitled to the declaration he seeks. He is the father of C. This judgment explains my reasons for that preliminary indication. It also comments upon the actions and omissions of the Herts and Essex Fertility Centre (HEFC) for identical reasons to those described by the President in his judgment. It is both alarming and shocking that, once more, a court is confronted with an instance of such striking ineptitude from an organisation which is subject to statutory regulation and monitored by a statutory regulator namely the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Like the President, I have considered the need or rather the absence of any requirement to outline the intensely private, mostly medical details arising from the written evidence filed by the parties. Just as in those cases decided by the President just a few months ago, anonymisation would be an insufficient response to what unquestionably are profoundly personal and intimate matters. It is sufficient to record that I have read and considered a volume of material &#8211; the written statements of M and F as well as those of the clinicians who treated the couple together with copies of those documents relevant to the parentage question.</p>

	  <num style="font-size:11.5pt">6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have also been immensely assisted by the summaries, chronologies, position statements, written and oral arguments of Ms Fottrell QC and Ms Sprinz on behalf of F, Ms Cover who represents M, Mr Powell on behalf of the Herts and Essex Clinic (&#8216;the Clinic&#8217;) and Mr Ford for the Children&#8217;s Guardian. In the circumstances of the mother&#8217;s concession, it was unnecessary to hear detailed oral evidence as to the processes which the parents underwent at the Clinic. But it is necessary to identify the legal framework so as to decide whether on the facts the father&#8217;s claim for declaratory relief is established.</p>

That is quite obviously a profoundly shocking state of affairs. Neither parent has had any offer of help, support or explanation for the situation in which they have been entangled.

The Medical Director accepts that the Clinic&#8217;s litigation conduct was wholly unsatisfactory and has prolonged the parents&#8217; distress.
