		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The Scott Schedule was set out in 72 numbered paragraphs. Many of these contained what was described as an &#8220;agreed context&#8221;. Paragraphs 13-24, 27, 29, 31-33, 35-45, 48, 51-59, 61, 63-65, 67, 69 and 71-72 contained the findings sought by the local authority which were disputed. The core allegations, set out in paragraphs 53-55, 65, were that MX had no intention of staying in Turkey; that she intended to travel from Istanbul to the Turkish border with Syria with the children; that once she had crossed the border into Syria she intended to join up with ISIS militants and to supply them with items of use to the group&#8217;s combative activities; and that her sole purpose and intention was to take up arms with ISIS militants and/or live for the foreseeable future in the Islamic caliphate ISIS claims to have established in the region. It was said (paragraphs 57-58) that, in essence, MX&#8217;s plan was to take the children to a war zone, and that she knowingly and intended to place the children at risk of significant harm. It was further alleged (paragraph 69) that &#8220;The mother is a radical fundamentalist with links and contacts with ISIS militants and those who seek to recruit others to their cause.&#8221;&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The mother disputes that the threshold criteria is crossed. She says that she was intending to travel to Turkey with the children for the purposes of a legitimate family holiday. She says that although she understands why the Local Authority has intervened, her wish is for the children to be returned to her care as quickly as possible or for them to be placed with a member of their family. Once the children have settled in their current placement, she would also like to have increased contact with them so that this takes place more than twice per week.&#8221;</p>

Her position, as encapsulated in her response to the local authority&#8217;s allegation in paragraph 69 (paragraph 78 in the final Scott Schedule), was that &#8220;I am a practising Muslim.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The finding of fact hearing was at that stage listed to start before me on 29 June 2015. Shortly before, the mother&#8217;s counsel, Mr Karl Rowley QC, circulated a position statement on her behalf. This set out her position in relation to the findings sought by the local authority as being that:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;she does not seek to oppose the making of a finding that she was intending to attempt to enter Syria and live in territory governed by the Islamic State. That is not to say that she accepts the truth of the allegations but she does not wish to resist the making of findings on the balance of probability. In these circumstances she does not require cross examination of the local authority witnesses and does not wish to give evidence herself.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That radical shift in her position gave rise to a certain amount of discussion in court when the hearing began on 29 June 2015. It was left that she would prepare and file a statement. The statement was circulated the next day, 30 June 2015. It represented another radical shift in her position. She acknowledged that she had not been fully open with the court and professionals. Her case now, in short, was (judgment, para 13) that:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely.&#8221;</p>

It is not for the mother to disprove it. In particular it is not for the mother to disprove it by proving how the injuries were in fact sustained. Neither is it for the court to determine how the injuries were sustained. The court&#8217;s task is to determine whether the local authority has proved its case on the balance of probability. Where, as here, there is a degree of medical uncertainty and credible evidence of a possible alternative explanation to that contended for by the local authority, the question for the court is not &#8216;has that possible alternative explanation been proved&#8217; but rather it should ask itself, &#8216;in the light of that possible alternative explanation can the court be satisfied that the local authority has proved its case on the simple balance of probability&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, he summarises the mother&#8217;s case that she had only one telephone number for H, which he had given her when they were speaking in the street on the occasion when they first met. But if this is so, he asks, why did she need to scribble the number down subsequently on a piece of paper (a written document which is securely dated some two months later) and when, on her evidence, they had already been communicating electronically for some time by that stage? Alternatively, if her explanation is that it was scribbled down the night before she travelled, when she first unpacked and charged her new Samsung phone, why was it on this piece of paper rather than one of the others? (Mr Crabtree also analyses what he says is the improbability of the mother&#8217;s explanations for how and why all this information came to be written down as it was, rather than being loaded on to the new phone, and as to how and why it came to be put in the suitcase. I need not rehearse his arguments but I have them very well in mind.) </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Next he analyses the mother&#8217;s evidence that: &#8220;After exchanging numbers I bought a &#8216;pay as you go&#8217; Lyca sim card to contact him.&#8221; He submits that, if there was some exchange of numbers she must have had some record of H&#8217;s number elsewhere which she could have referred to at a later stage when she called him using the Lyca Sim card and, equally, H must have had a second number for her. Hence, the alleged loss of the Lyca sim card was not fatal to future attempts by them to contact each other. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Crabtree also submits to critical analysis the mother&#8217;s explanation for the loss of the Lyca sim card number, namely that she left it at home after she discovered it did not fit into her new Samsung telephone the night before she was due to travel but that when she returned home it was not there. As he points out, the only intervening events were the police search and access to the property by people known to her. He suggests that if it really was there, it is strange that the police did not find it, given it was precisely the sort of thing they were interested in. Had it been left in an obvious place, he submits that it is pretty inconceivable that they would not find it. Alternatively, if it had been secreted away, although it is possible the police may have missed it, the mother would have been able to find it when she returned. If someone close to the mother had decided to remove it, it is, he says, unlikely that they would not have either returned it or spoken to her about it following her release. He adds that the sim card was clearly important to her, for it was the only means (supposedly) by which H could contact her. Why, then, not take the original telephone with her in which it did work?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to this, Mr Crabtree questions the mother&#8217;s account of a broken iPhone which was replaced with a Nokia before she upgraded to the Samsung and which has subsequently disappeared. He submits that, wherever the truth lies as to some Nokia device, the simple fact is that, just like the Lyca sim card disappeared, so too did the iPhone on which all those electronic messages to H would have been backed up. He also points to the curious fact, clearly established in evidence, that the iPhone was last used, in another town, the day after the mother&#8217;s arrest but has not been used since. He submits that this is all consistent with the sim card and iPhone having been &#8216;made&#8217; to vanish rather than the one vanishing and the other mysteriously finding its way to another town without the intervention of the mother&#8217;s family or friends.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, Mr Crabtree submits that it is inherently improbable that H was, as the mother asserts, a potential suitor. According to her, this was no more than a five minute meeting on a street with a man collecting money for Syrian refugees. Such a brief meeting, he suggests, was exceedingly unlikely to lead on to a discussion about their marital statuses and his career and background, and a mutual exchange of telephone numbers. It was, moreover, he says, alien and at odds with the modest approach the mother claims to have adopted towards contacting H since she supposedly abandoned or, as she would have it, was wrongly forced to abandon her ambitions to marry him.</p>

Mr Crabtree points in this respect to the dearth of information about H she was able to supply in answer to the questions posed to her both by the local authority and by the police.</p>

Those closest to her had already been dragged into it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s attempt to explain her reticence to the police as being driven by DS SH&#8217;s hostility to her is unconvincing, given the comparatively few dealings he had with her before she was handed over to other officers and the conclusions which, Mr Crabtree says, I can properly draw about DS SH from having seen and heard him give evidence. He submits that what the mother suggests, both on this and on other points (her denial that she gave a false address in an attempt to mislead the police as to where she lived &#8211; a finding which Mr Crabtree invites me to make &#8211; and her suggestion that the otherwise unexplained Air France ticket had somehow been planted in her luggage) is out of kilter with the evidence and the demeanour of both DS SH and DI CC and the other officers and reveals a good deal more about her and her disparaging attitude towards the police than anything else. And in any event, as Mr Crabtree points out, none of what the mother says about the police, can begin to explain her subsequent failure to give a supposedly full, open and honest account to the local authority, to the guardian and to the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Sixthly, Mr Crabtree says that, equally revealing, is the fact that, according to the mother, the man who had asked her to be his wife and whom she had agreed to at least explore the issue with further, with a visit following months of electronic communication, did nothing to ascertain her whereabouts or safety when unexpectedly and without notice she failed to arrive in Turkey as they had discussed and agreed. Whatever the mother&#8217;s explanations, based on an allegedly missing sim card, there were surely, says Mr Crabtree, other ways in which he could have contacted her (for example, via the contacts he must have had in this country to be supposedly collecting on the street, via extended family networks or social media or by coming to this country and visiting her).   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, he submits, it is no answer for the mother to say she never contacted H as no-one asked her to. The suggestion, Mr Crabtree says, is with respect nonsense, given what she says she knew about the importance of making contact with him &#8211; she eventually admitted that she realised the importance of this back in May 2015 &#8211;, what she says her brother supposedly did and what any reasonable parent would have done in her situation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Crabtree makes clear that the local authority&#8217;s primary case is that there never was any attempt by the mother or her brother to contact H. He points out that the first time anyone heard the assertion that her brother had tried to telephone H was when the mother was in the witness box and, indeed, several minutes into cross-examination. She had had every opportunity to make this part of her case clear long before. Why did she not do?  Because, he submits, it was a lie told out of desperation, when the obvious defect in her account was put to her, to plug a gap in a story which was at that point on the brink of total collapse. </p>

But that falls away if her story as to her relationship with H falls away, as, he says, it has. Thus, Mr Crabtree submits, the inevitable conclusion to be drawn is that the mother had those items for some other reason which has not been prepared to share and which, he further submits, fits &#8216;tradecraft&#8217; as described by the police officers in their evidence.</p>

The evidence, he says, supports the view that her relationship with the father was abusive, that she fled and sought advice from the police and the health visitor, and that what he calls her extrication of them from the toxic atmosphere of her relationship with the father was an act of protecting them.

On the contrary, he submits, the evidence points in the opposite direction. As he puts it, though she is observant, dressing modestly and regarding Islam as the mainspring of her and the children&#8217;s lives, the mother does not evince an extremist interpretation of her faith. Though she covers her head and wears black outer garments, she wears Western clothes beneath, included heeled shoes. She wears makeup, four bags of which were recovered from her luggage, which, as DS AH accepted, is frowned upon by ISIS. As shown by what could be seen on the DVDs &#8211; and there was no suggestion that these items were <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>included in the items returned to the mother by the police after her luggage was searched &#8211; her children dress colourfully: witness the pink tutu dresses and a Spiderman onesie. They watch Disney films and sing popular Western songs. None of this, says Mr Rowley, is consistent with an Islamic extremist; none is consistent with someone who would wish to live under what he calls the medieval strictures of the so-called Caliphate.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">

The flag is one that has been adopted by ISIS, but it contains the <span style="font-style:italic">shahada</span> and seal of the Prophet Mohammed, both of which, he says, are important symbols which all Muslims share. The local authority, he correctly points out, has failed to adduce any evidence to disprove the proposition that the flag predated the al-Baghdadi Caliphate, and the mother&#8217;s case that she received it from a bookshop some 12 years ago as a gift has not been seriously challenged. Similarly, he says, in relation to a list of CDs containing material produced by al-Awlaki, none of which, as he correctly observes, has been demonstrated to be evidence of extremism. Accepting, as he does, that al-Awlaki&#8217;s material has been found in the possession of those prosecuted in connection with terrorism offences, possession of it, he says, is not <span style="font-style:italic">in se</span> demonstrative of radicalisation. Al-Awlaki, he says, without challenge, produced a great volume of material prior to his death, some controversial, some not.

She is dependent on medication, principally Tramadol and Amitriptyline. The quantity of both recovered from her luggage was, he says, consistent with usage over a few weeks, not months or years. Without the medication her mobility is restricted and her health compromised. The idea that she would relocate to a war-torn region with no obvious means of securing the medication necessary to enable her to function is, he submits, intrinsically unlikely.</p>

She is not, he says, blind to the dangers associated with that region. He submits that the only thing which could conceivably overbear her instincts and reason to such an extent that she would think that joining the Islamic State was in her children&#8217;s interests would be religious imperative. She has maintained throughout that she is not radicalised and does not recognise the legitimacy of the al-Baghdadi Caliphate. There is, he says, no evidence that this part of her evidence is false. The evidence taken in the round, he submits, is that her children are not withdrawn from the Western world and that she does not abjure those things which a radical Islamist would regard as <span style="font-style:italic">haram</span>. Moreover, neither she nor her mother could realistically function in ISIS-controlled regions given their medical conditions.</p>

If the mother wanted to create a &#8216;legend&#8217; that provided a cover for her plan to relocate to Syria, Mr Rowley points out that she and her group failed to follow &#8216;tradecraft&#8217; advice. Whilst the family have given accounts of a holiday with outdoor elements they had not carried with them guidebooks and they had not booked hotels. This, he submits, is inconsistent with a carefully-staged cover-story; indeed, it is, he suggests, consistent with the rather more ad hoc approach to a holiday which might be subject to variation depending upon what occurred with the mother&#8217;s relationship with H.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, Mr Rowley points to the weaknesses in the local authority&#8217;s thesis based upon the mother&#8217;s acquaintanceship with the individuals, members of the mother&#8217;s wider family, who are alleged to have travelled to Syria in 2014. He accepts that the mother had an association with some of those persons, but submits that a direct relationship with all of them has not been proved. She did not know Z and F very well. She had been close to S (S had been a source of support to her following the breakdown of the mother&#8217;s marriage) and was in regular communication with her until August 2014; there is, he says, no evidence of any contact between them since. The mother asserts that S said nothing to her indicating sympathy with ISIS or an intention to travel to Syria, which, as Mr Rowley points out, would accord with the advice in the e-book. Mr Rowley submits that the finding the local authority seeks that these individuals travelled to Turkey to join ISIS is based only on the police&#8217;s conclusion. There is, he says, no evidence of it. It is no more than a weak inference from an absence of evidence beyond the fact of their disappearance. In any event, he submits, a conclusion that the mother knew of such a plan is not justified, nor can it be regarded as the basis for a finding that the mother is herself sympathetic to ISIS or was intending to join her family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, he challenges the local authority&#8217;s assertion that the evidence demonstrates the mother&#8217;s intention to abandon life in this country. Had she had a settled intention not to return, then, he says, evidence of abandonment of her life here would be expected. Nothing discovered from the search of her home, he submits, points in that direction. It is not said, for instance, to be a home which has been left in a state indicative of permanent flight, instead of a holiday. The <span style="font-style:italic">only </span>evidence the local authority has, he says, is the &#8216;to do&#8217; list and the letters to the schools. The &#8216;to do&#8217; list, he says, shows an inveterate list maker in action; it does not show, on its face, evidence which contradicts the mother&#8217;s account of it being compiled months before the holiday. And there is no evidence, for example, of the mother terminating the tenancy or changing direct debits. He characterises the letters to the schools as being &#8220;ill-advised and something the mother regrets&#8221; but submits that they do not support the notion of emigration. After all, if she wished to throw the authorities off her trail as she travelled to Syria, why would she excuse only three days of the children&#8217;s school attendance? </p>

Her explanation was that because of the last-minute charging of her telephone she was unable to transpose them to her telephone prior to the trip. The paper, she says, was stuffed into the luggage; &#8216;secreted&#8217;, Mr Rowley says, is no more than a description arising from a conclusion as to her overall intent.</p>

It would, says Mr Rowley, have been a curious step for her to do so, given that he was also being detained. Also, and within an hour, when being interviewed again, she gave her own address. Mr Rowley invites me to question what the benefit to her of giving the wrong address would have been, only a short while later to give her real address. He also points out that in the event, as he would have it, nothing of significance was recovered as a result of the house search.</p>

The children had by then had the experience of being detained, along with their mother, at the airport. The mother knew that she was suspected of travelling to Syria. DS SH suggested to her, while the children were present, that he did not believe her account of a family holiday. There is, Mr Rowley suggests, every possibility that the children overheard something; X1 knows what the allegation was; it would be natural for the children to talk amongst themselves; they were distressed and confused. It is, he says, all but impossible to isolate the comment from the children&#8217;s recent life experiences and understanding. Importantly, as he points out, neither X2 nor X1 was ABE interviewed. We simply do not know, he says, of the circumstances leading up to the statement.</p>

There is an absence of evidence, he says, substantiating an assertion that she is a radical Islamist, and that her belief system is concordant with that of ISIS. The absence of evidence of radicalisation, and indeed evidence pointing in the other direction, deprives the local authority&#8217;s case, he submits, of a coherent thesis of her motivation to live in ISIS controlled territory. Moreover, he submits, questions over the adequacy of her explanation for the trip and the presence of materials which are said to be consistent with &#8216;tradecraft&#8217; cannot fill that critical lacuna and tip the balance of probability in favour of a finding that she was taking her children to live in Syria.</p>

She had had, he says, a difficult, at times abusive, relationship with the father. Her flight from him, her illness, the disappearance of S, her discovery that the father was having another child by another woman, and other events had a significant impact upon her and, he suggests, disordered her reason to some extent. In addition there is what Mr Rowley calls the cultural/religious aspect of her association with H, which may not be readily understood by some professionals. He points to her explanation in her statement and in the witness box as showing that, for someone of faith, trusting in Providence is reasonable. Dating, he points out, was not in truth a viable option. She had satisfied herself through her contact with him that H might be a suitable suitor; events in Turkey were to be the proof.</p>

Mr Rowley urges caution. His argument proceeds as follows. H&#8217;s number was in the hands of the police from the moment the mother&#8217;s luggage was searched; her access to it in the immediate aftermath was therefore denied; once she was able to see the document with it written on she asked her brother to contact H but that proved fruitless; and when she finally gave her account in June 2015 of H and who he was, she was presented with lengthy interrogatories the purpose of which was to enable the <span style="font-style:italic">police</span> to track him down; <span style="font-style:italic">she</span> was not asked to make contact with H (blame for this, says Mr Rowley lies with him, not the mother).

He submits that, notwithstanding her inability to produce <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> independent evidence of H&#8217;s existence, the most likely explanation for the narrative is therefore its essential truth.</p>

The same, he says, can be said for the absence, with few exceptions, of outdoor or cold-weather clothing for the children. There can, he submits, be no safe inference that the mother and children envisaged living in deprived circumstances in a war-torn country, given that the majority of the children&#8217;s clothing was colourful and fitted for a temperate climate. Mr Rowley adds that, even if I was to conclude that H was asking for material which may have been intended for use by those in Syria (which, he says, is not the mother&#8217;s belief) it does not follow that the mother knew or should have suspected that.</p>

(e) DS AH said there was not evidence to suggest that the family might split and go different ways, but he was unable to tell the court what such evidence might be which would support such a conclusion. (f) DS AH does not put much weight on the issue of tampons and panty liners. This evidence proved to be different from what had been anticipated. (g) No police officer expressed the view that the items seen on the mother&#8217;s DVDs were not those which had been returned to mother. (h) The police suggest that the mother was evasive or untruthful and delaying in relation to her address given at the airport. Can the court make the leap to say that this was because she was intending to permanently relocate to Syria? The mother has conceded that she was lying throughout the interview process, but her reasons for so doing are difficult to untangle. Her evidence is that she &#8220;closed down&#8221; whilst speaking to the police, and that her fear of repercussions from the father was the most prominent reason for not speaking the truth. (i) No inferences are drawn by the police about there being the same number of chargers as there were devices. (j) The police agree (DC DR) that all non-pertinent items could be associated with a normal family holiday. (k) The mother was in custody for 5 days, and her children were placed into foster care. The police question, as indeed does the guardian, why the mother, who says that her children are her world and beyond, would not give the history about H at the time she was interviewed or swiftly, during these proceedings, to the court.  </p>

The contrast between her original case, as I have summarised it in paragraph 7 above, and her revised case, set out in paragraph 10 above is obvious. If elements of her first story have been carried forward into the second, the two are nonetheless so fundamentally different that one or other must be essentially untrue. This is not mere <span style="font-style:italic">suggestio falsi et suppressio veri</span>; it is simply the telling of untruths, in plain terms lying. The notes to the schools were, on any basis, and wherever the ultimate truth in relation to the trip may lie, false to the mother&#8217;s knowledge. Mr Rowley characterises them (paragraph 66) as &#8220;ill-advised&#8221;. I cannot, with respect, agree. They involved the deliberate uttering of falsehoods. I am also satisfied, and find as a fact, that the mother did indeed give a false address when questioned by DS SH. And the allegations she made in the witness-box against the police were, in my judgment, and I so find, utterly groundless. On matters of <span style="font-style:italic">fact</span> I accept the evidence of each of the police officers. I cannot accept Mr Rowley&#8217;s submissions on the point (paragraph 68).</p>

People may be otherwise very good parents (in the sense in which society generally would use the phrase) while yet being driven by fanaticism, whether religious or political, to expose their children to what most would think to be plain, obvious and very great significant harm.

The mother has wholly failed to persuade me, however, either that she met H in the circumstances she describes, or that their relationship was as she asserts, or that the role (if any) he was to play in Turkey was as she says. The whole of her evidence on the matter is, in effect, uncorroborated. I am unable to accept her as being either a reliable or indeed a truthful witness. The mother, in my judgment, has not proved her case in relation to H. That carries Mr Crabtree part of the way, but not necessarily all the way he would have me go. He submits, as we have seen, that the fundamental foundation on which the mother&#8217;s case is built has collapsed. So it has, <span style="font-style:italic">in the sense, but only in the sense, that she has not proved her case</span>.

For reasons I have already touched on I can attach little weight to the point made by Mr Rowley as I have summarised it in paragraph 52 above. His other points have much more substance. His arguments (paragraphs 53-54, 56) as to the absence of any evidence that the mother is a radical Islamist, and as to where that leaves the local authority (paragraph 70), are compelling, and Mr Crabtree was able to say very little by way of any convincing response. (In relation to the DVDs I prefer Mr Rowley&#8217;s submission to that of Mr Crabtree.) The fact is, I find, that the mother is an observant Muslim, but the local authority has been unable to prove either that the materials found at her home have the significance which was suggested or, more generally, that she is a radical or extremist. I accept Mr Rowley&#8217;s characterisation (paragraph 55) of the mother&#8217;s medical conditions and the inferences he seeks to draw, though inclined to think, for the reasons given by Mr Crabtree (paragraphs 47(vi)-47(vii)), that there may have been some degree of exaggeration in her descriptions of her disability.</p>

There was no challenge at the time to my order. This judgment relates to a finding of fact hearing. Although I accept that a local authority&#8217;s formulation of the facts which it invites the court to find may differ depending upon whether it is pursuing one kind of proceedings rather than another (though that is not the case here, where the local authority&#8217;s Scott Schedule was formulated in terms of &#8216;threshold&#8217;), the forensic process when the court is conducting a finding of fact hearing is precisely the same whether the finding of fact hearing is part of care proceedings, part of wardship proceedings, part of private law proceedings, or indeed part of any other kind of family proceedings. So the dichotomy between care proceedings and wardship proceedings, as Mr Crabtree refers to it, has nothing whatever to do with the judgment which he seeks to challenge.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Secondly, I do not see what formulation of principles or guidance from the Court of Appeal Mr Crabtree can have in mind. Cases of this kind inevitably vary. Sometimes recourse to the inherent jurisdiction will be necessary, for example if the court is to be invited to make orders directed to the return to this jurisdiction of children who are abroad. The present is an example of a different set of circumstances where recourse to wardship was appropriate. In other cases, it will be neither necessary nor appropriate to invoke the inherent jurisdiction, care proceedings being appropriate and enabling the court to make whatever orders are required. The present case, in my judgment, is simply not an appropriate vehicle for debating largely abstract questions which do not in fact arise and which are thus both hypothetical and academic.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, Mr Crabtree seeks to challenge my failure to find that the local authority had established its case where, he says, the evidence was very strong, the mother&#8217;s decisions and intentions were, on my findings, unexplained, and there was an absence of any rational explanation for the mother&#8217;s acts, other than that contended for by the local authority. He wishes to invite the Court of Appeal to make the findings which, after hearing all the evidence, I declined to make. If this is simply a challenge to my findings then, as Mr Crabtree readily accepted, he has a very steep hill to climb. Mr Rowley submitted that it amounted, in effect, to a complaint that my findings were perverse. Be that as it may, I am entirely unpersuaded by Mr Crabtree that he has any realistic prospect of succeeding in circumstances where he does not allege any error of law. At times I had the impression that Mr Crabtree was suggesting that I had erred in my approach, particularly in not accepting where the absence of any other rational explanation should have taken me. In relation to that, I do not accept the underlying premise that there is no rational explanation for the mother&#8217;s acts other than that contended for by the local authority. That is not a finding I have made, nor, in my judgment, does it follow from the findings I have made. Furthermore, the argument came far too close at times to arguments rejected by Lord Brandon in <span style="font-style:italic">The Popi M</span> (see at 955-956). Insofar as Mr Crabtree is alleging some error of approach or error of principle I am unable to accept that his arguments have any realistic prospect of success.</p>

As with his previous ground of challenge, this is a challenge to findings of fact which Mr Crabtree does not persuade me has any realistic prospect of success.   </p>

Otherwise, he fears, any appeal might be stultified by the disappearance of the mother and the children. Despite Mr Rowley&#8217;s protests that a stay is neither necessary nor appropriate, I am prepared to grant a stay, but only for a very short period. I will stay my order until 12 noon on Friday 18 December. If by that time the local authority has filed with the Court of Appeal an appellant&#8217;s notice and grounds of appeal, together with an application for a further stay, then the stay I have granted will automatically be extended until 4.30 pm on Monday 21 December 2015. If there is to be any stay thereafter, it will have to be granted by the Court of Appeal.</p>

He asserts that, despite my findings, there remains a distinct possibility that the children are at risk of harm from the mother, whose behaviour he characterises as unfathomable, and says that the local authority in those circumstances wishes, through work with her, to gain a greater understanding than it has at present of what the mother was doing and proposing to do when stopped at the airport.</p>

He asks rhetorically why, if Mr Crabtree&#8217;s approach is legitimate, it will not be possible for every local authority which fails to prove &#8216;threshold&#8217; at a finding of fact hearing in care proceedings simply to carry on by invoking the wardship jurisdiction.

The relief which Mr Crabtree seeks could in principle be achieved through the mechanism of care proceedings.
