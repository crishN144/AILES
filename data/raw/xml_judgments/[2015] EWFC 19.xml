	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the retrial of an application by Northumberland County Council, issued on 29 September 2013, for care and placement orders in relation to a little boy, S, who was born on 3 March 2013. The background to the case, the reasons why this is a retrial and the reasons why the case has taken so long to come to a conclusion are set out in a judgment given by Her Honour Judge Hudson on 29 August 2014 which I shall take as read: <span style="font-style:italic">Re S </span>[2014] EWFC B154.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The hearing began before me on Monday 17 November 2014. The local authority was represented by Ms Claire Middleton, the mother by Ms Pauline Moulder, the father by Mr Justin Gray and the guardian by Mr Thomas Finch. I heard evidence, in this order, from the social worker, from the mother, from the father, from the father&#8217;s mother, from the father&#8217;s step-father, and from the guardian. Submissions finished at about 5pm on Friday 21 November 2014. I reserved my decision. Subsequently, on 25 November 2014 I notified the parties that I had come to the clear conclusion that I must make the care and placement orders sought by the local authority. Accordingly, care and placement orders in relation to S were made. They are dated 25 November 2014. I now hand down judgment explaining my decision. I am very sorry that it has been so delayed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The argument lay between, on the side, S&#8217;s father, whose plan was supported by the mother and, on the other side, the local authority, whose plan was supported by the guardian. Threshold was, rightly, conceded by both parents, though a number of crucially important factual issues which I need to determine were disputed, in particular as between the father and the local authority. The agreed threshold criteria are set out in a document dated 1 November 2014. The local authority&#8217;s schedule of findings it seeks is also dated 1 November 2014. The father&#8217;s response is dated 13 November 2014. Whilst it contains a number of important and significant concessions, the fact is that in some respects it is grudging in its acceptance of the true reality. For instance, and of some importance, he &#8220;denies&#8221; that he has &#8220;minimised his alcohol use.&#8221;  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father argued that S should be returned to his care, subject to a supervision order. The local authority contended that S should be adopted. All other options had been ruled out at an earlier stage in the proceedings. Everyone was, correctly, agreed that these were the only two realistic options that I needed to consider. The mother, it should be noted, does <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>seek the return of S to her care, though she wants contact with him. She recognises that contact may require to be supervised, if need be by the local authority.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the background, I need do no more than refer to paragraphs 23-30 of Judge Hudson&#8217;s judgment. As will be seen, key issues in the case relate to the father&#8217;s history of alcohol abuse and domestic violence between the father and the mother to which S was exposed. This culminated in a very serious incident on 28 June 2013, following which the parents separated. However, the precipitating circumstances related to the mother&#8217;s new partner and not the father. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as concerns the impact of this on S, the local authority&#8217;s case is encapsulated in its assertion that &#8220;during the first six months of his life, S experienced a chaotic and transient lifestyle with little routine and stability and where he was exposed to the aggressive, volatile and violent relationship of his parents&#8221; &#8211; this is accepted in much watered down form by the father &#8211; and its concern that S was &#8220;a passive baby who was not fazed or distressed by being with strangers or during the incident on 20 September&#8221; 2013.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as concerns the father, the kernel of the local authority&#8217;s concerns is that he has used violence and aggression in his relationship with the mother; that he has struggled to accept his role in their volatile and violent relationship and that his actions and inaction during the first 6 months of S&#8217;s life caused him significant harm and exposed him to the risk of further harm.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before proceeding any further I need to focus on two aspects of the history to which both the local authority and the guardian appropriately attached considerable significance. The first relates to the alcohol fuelled and stormy relationship between the mother and the father. The second relates to the father&#8217;s engagement with the local authority and other professionals.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father, who was born in 1988, has a history of alcohol abuse and of offending, both going back to his early teenage years. On any view the two have tended to be linked. His last conviction was in May 2013 (see below). The mother, who was born in 1994, had a very troubled childhood. She was first arrested in May 2009 and has since had many interactions with the police. For present purposes I concentrate on events between 2010 and 2013. The account which follows, and which represents my findings, is drawn from information supplied by the police, from the father&#8217;s medical records, from other documents filed in the proceedings and from the oral evidence given by the mother and the father. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;He stated after his son was born he was repeatedly &#8216;concerned for his son&#8217;s welfare due to [the mother&#8217;s] lifestyle&#8217; stating &#8216;I had these concerns long before professionals did&#8217;. Despite this, [he] stated he chose not to alert professionals to these concerns, in fact taking the opposite stance in seeking to cut out professional involvement on the basis that it was &#8216;causing him and [her] stress&#8217; and preventing them from parenting their son effectively. Whilst it is positive to state in retrospect that he had concerns, in reality, during that time, [he] was either minimising those concerns in any contact with professionals or simply not telling them. It is difficult to understand the paradox in [his] statements; on the one hand he states [she] is a &#8220;good Mum&#8221; and is to be &#8220;trusted&#8221;; on the other hand he expresses concerns about her &#8220;behaviour&#8221; and &#8220;attitude&#8221;. Whatever the explanation, [he] never expressed any of his alleged concerns to any of the professionals involved. In my experience as a Social Worker where there is dissonance between a person&#8217;s verbal statements and his behaviour, it is invariably the behaviour that is most reliable gauge of that person&#8217;s views.</p>

		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Regarding parents lack of engagement with the Child Protection plan and his unwillingness to alert professionals of his concerns for his son, he stated &#8216;I would never put my son in the eyes of Children&#8217;s Services for any reason&#8217;. I find this comment highly concerning; should his son be placed in his sole care, [he] will need to work with professionals and self-report any issues; historically, [he] and [she] have failed to do this and I cannot say without any certainty that this would happen given these comments. [He] appeared somewhat defensive and a little arrogant in his general manner when challenged on this issue; his answers were often contradictory and I felt he again lacked any real understanding and took no responsibility for his actions during this time. Initially he stated that &#8216;[She] was dishonest, I wasn&#8217;t&#8217; and that he was &#8216;not a dishonest person&#8217;. I challenged this and brought to his attention a number of occasions whereby he and [she] had lied to professionals about their relationship and breached the contact plan; he responded &#8216;professionals never asked me&#8217;. He later admitted he didn&#8217;t work to the Child protection plan, that he did in fact breach agreements and that [she] and S were staying with him when they weren&#8217;t supposed to be but denied being dishonest about it. [He] stated that when [she] stopped his contact with his son and he was advised to seek legal advice, in his eyes, the contract with Children&#8217;s Services had ended. He stated &#8216;[She] offered me my child and I would never say no regardless of what plans were in place&#8217; and &#8216;I would never reject [her] or my son from my home no matter who told me to do so&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

Whilst [he] was able to recognise that he was wrong to have drank alcohol whilst caring for his son stating &#8216;he could have fell over, fell asleep, may not be fully alert and may not have been thinking clearly&#8217;, he was of the firm opinion that he had not harmed his son that night and lacked complete insight into the fact his son would have been terrified, was caught up in the altercation falling out of his car seat and could have been seriously harmed.

Reflecting back on this violence, [he] was unsure as to whether his son came to any harm when caught up in the altercation where he fell out of the car seat and it was only when the physical risks and the fact he would have been terrified were pointed out to [him] that he was able to accept this.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[The father], to his great credit, has continued to be proactive in terms of his learning and to better himself as a parent. Impressively, he has acted autonomously in accessing and completing a course in domestic violence and anger management as he perceived that other people were recognising something in him that he himself was unable to see. However [his] own accounts of what he has learned suggest he is not yet able to deal with accepting responsibility. It is also commendable that his parents are able to offer a high level of support and have provided some very insightful information into [his] functioning and areas in which they feel he needs support.</p>

Based on the information to date, the risks of rehabilitation not being successful are high but [rehabilitation is] not entirely ruled out. [He] has utilised the time that has passed since the last proceedings in a way that has benefited his understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood in addition to examining his own behaviours. However the main obstacle to this view, is that this learning, through no fault of [his] own, has been theoretical. The elements which have been discussed within this addendum are, for want of a better term, untried or academic.</p>

However during this assessment process, I have not seen consistent examples of these; for instance, in respect of honest communication, he has not divulged his arrest in April 2014 nor has he divulged the full extent of his housing problems. In respect of meaningful engagement with professionals, this remains uncertain given [his] own accounts indicating he would only engage on his terms.</p>

There are concerns that a rehabilitation, which may not be successful, would result in S being emotionally damaged by this process and his need for stability and security not being met.

She explained that because we cannot understand the major triggers for the father&#8217;s behaviour, we cannot be confident about his future relationships. The father&#8217;s abilities were largely untested. The mother was unpredictable and the guardian did not think that one could manage all the risks that contact with her might involve. Overall, she did not think there was a reasonably good prospect of success for S if he was placed with his father. It was &#8220;not a chance that should be taken.&#8221; She was not confident, she had &#8220;real doubts&#8221;, there was &#8220;considerable risk.&#8221; She emphasised that any move for S now must be the final move.</p>

I accept that <span style="font-style:italic">to an extent </span>S&#8217;s removal into care served as a &#8216;wake up&#8217; call for father and motivated him to change. I accept also that <span style="font-style:italic">up to a point </span>the father is in a better position today than he was in 2013, that is, a better position both in relation to himself and also in relation to his potential ability to look after a child of S&#8217;s age. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the first place, the father on his own admission was lying in his evidence before the family proceedings court and, until quite a late stage in his oral evidence to me, was, as he admitted, less than frank in what he was saying to me. The importance of this is not that the father was lying, it is <span style="font-style:italic">why </span>he was lying. It was, I am satisfied, not just that he wanted to defeat the local authority&#8217;s case. It was because, until he reached the almost cathartic moment when, in very emotional evidence, he began to leave his lies behind him, he had been unable even to begin to face up to and acknowledge, even to himself, let alone to others, the extent of the domestic violence, the extent of his problems with alcohol and the extent of his failings as a father. This threw into sharp and revealing relief the substance &#8211; or, rather, the lack of real substance in his earlier protestations of change. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, and on this point I accept the local authority&#8217;s submission, none of the work which the father has done in an attempt to address his various problems &#8211; both his problems with alcohol and the other problems chronicled in the GP notes &#8211; has dealt with the root causes. And to a significant extent the various improvements which the father identifies are based on his own self-reporting.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, I agree with the guardian&#8217;s submission, which the history I have rehearsed more than bears out, that the alcohol which the father uses as a coping mechanism is in large part the trigger for his on occasions extreme violence, not merely domestic violence but also violence more generally. The importance of this, of course, is that there is nothing in his tendency to alcohol induced violence specific to his now-ended relationship with S&#8217;s mother. So what confidence can one have that some future relationship will not exhibit the same features? The answer, I am driven to conclude, is that one can have no confidence at all that past behaviour will not be replicated in future. On the contrary, there is a very real risk that it will.</p>

It may be that it is just too painful for him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The sad reality is that S was damaged, seriously damaged, emotionally and psychologically, by what I am satisfied was the chaotic lifestyle he endured while being cared for by parents, the father and the mother, whose relationship was volatile and characterised by, on occasions really serious, alcohol induced domestic violence. It seems that he probably slept through the culminating episode of gross domestic violence on 28 June 2013, but one has to remember that in the earlier incident on 19 April 2013, when he was only a few weeks old, he was actually in his father&#8217;s arms when he kicked the mother <span style="font-style:italic">in the ribs</span>. The proof of the effect of all this on S is stark: the profoundly saddening description by the social worker of how S presented on 20 September 2013 and the heartening contrast between the picture S presented then with the much improved picture he presented after some time in foster care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the end of the day, and stripped down to essentials, the question is whether S will be <span style="font-style:italic">safe </span>in his father&#8217;s care. I can have no confidence that he will be, no confidence that he will not be exposed in future to repetitions of what he was exposed to during the first six months of his life. There is in my judgment a very real, indeed a significant and substantial, risk that what has happened to him before will happen to him again. It is a risk related fundamentally to the father; it is not a risk which is removed or ameliorated by the fact that the father&#8217;s relationship with the mother has ended. The risk, in my judgment, is simply too high to contemplate. It is, in my judgment, a risk which is simply unmanageable, whatever practical mechanisms, whether family or professional, might be put in place.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Adoption is a drastic remedy. It is to be contemplated only when &#8220;nothing else will do.&#8221; And the court must not come to the conclusion that &#8220;nothing else will do&#8221; until it has evaluated all the other realistically available options <span style="font-style:italic">and </span>considered whether its concerns can be adequately met by the provision of appropriate support and services, whether from the local authority or from family and friends. I have taken into account what the father&#8217;s mother and step-father can offer, but without in any way doubting their integrity and commitment they will not be able, however willing, to provide the support and, more critically, the necessary safety mechanisms which S must have if he is to be safe. Nor can the local authority, however substantial the support it might in principle be able to offer. How, after all, in the real world is S to be protected by third party engagement from a repetition of events such as those which took place on 19 April 2013 and 28 June 2013?</p>

I am satisfied that &#8220;nothing else will do.&#8221; Indeed, and in truth, there is no other outcome capable of affording S the protection which he must have from the ongoing risks which his father presents.</p>

It is much more fundamental than that. It goes, in essence, as I have said, to the question of whether S will be safe if rehabilitated to his father&#8217;s care. The fact, in my judgment, is that he will not be.</p>
