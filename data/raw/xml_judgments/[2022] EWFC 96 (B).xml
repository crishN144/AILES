	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">On 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of January 2021 Paul Goodyear (the Applicant) and Heather Goodyear settled their financial remedy proceedings by way of a consent order which was approved by District Judge Pollard. In round terms the capital was split reasonably equally so that each party received just over &#163;500,000 and there was a pension sharing order in favour of Heather Goodyear in respect of 51% of Mr Goodyear&#8217;s Shell pension which had a cash equivalent in excess of &#163;1 million. The pension credit so created would have been worth in the region of &#163;600,000. Tragically Heather Goodyear died on 3 August 2021. The Applicant applies for the pension sharing order to be set aside. The executors of the estate of Heather Goodyear (the Respondents) oppose the application.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">There are a number of issues that are raised within this application, but the fundamental issue is whether or not the death of Heather Goodyear has invalidated the basis or fundamental assumption upon which the order was made as is required following the Barder line of authorities. The respective arguments can be crudely summarised as:</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">The Applicant states that a pension is intended as a form of income and upon the death of Heather Goodyear that income would not be required and could not be utilised. It is further added that if at the date of entering into the consent order it was known that Heather Goodyear would die within six months the pension sharing order would not have been made.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The parties to the financial remedy proceedings were married in 1979 and separated in 2017. As at the date of the consent order the Applicant was aged 66 and  Heather Goodyear was 64. There were two children of the marriage: Chloe Goodyear who is now aged 36 and Craig Goodyear who is aged 32. They are acting as the executors for the purposes of these proceedings. Unfortunately, they are now estranged from the Applicant and the family tensions are apparent within this litigation. It is unfortunate to note that this animus features heavily in the statement prepared for the Respondents. It is not relevant information for the purposes of this hearing and not helpful. It will not be referred to within this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The Applicant issued his Form A on 2 August 2019 and within the negotiations a Pensions on Divorce Expert (PODE) report was obtained. That report set out the percentage required within a pension sharing order to provide equality of income which would have been 52.16% and also a figure for an equal share of capital value which would be 49.5%. The compromise that was reached between the parties was 51% by way of a pension share. As stated above the other substantial order related to the former matrimonial home which had equity in excess of &#163;700,000 and there was a further &#163;330,000 of capital between the parties. The capital split was one of equality and the pension share was close to equality.</p>

The Decree Absolute and the pension sharing order had been served on the Pension company, but the pension share had not been implemented. Heather Goodyear had made enquires in relation to what steps she was able to take concerning the pension share. On 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July she had signed an &#8220;Expression of Wishes &#8211; Pension Death Benefit&#8221; form naming the two adult children as her beneficiaries.

However, the application for permission to appeal was not dismissed at that hearing in order to act as a bar on the pension sharing order taking effect as set out in reg 9 (2) Divorce etc (pensions) Regulations 2000 (SI2000/1123) which states : &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000;background-color:#FFFFFF">The filing of a notice of appeal within the time allowed for doing so prevents the order taking effect before the appeal has been dealt with.&#8221;</span><span style="color:#000000;background-color:#FFFFFF"> It is agreed that the appeal application will be dismissed once the decision in relation to the set aside application is concluded. </span></p>

He raised this issue within his statement as to whether there may have been a lack of disclosure when the original agreement was reached. It is now agreed, following perusal of the subsequent disclosure that Heather Goodyear was not aware of any diagnosis at the time of the Consent Order. Indeed, tragically Heather Goodyear only became aware of the diagnosis in late June 2021. That issue is no longer pursued but it is not difficult to understand how this has raised the temperature of the litigation. </p>

This was upon the refusal of an application by the Applicant for Decree Absolute in August 2020  which, it is said, was refused due to the Financial Remedy application still being outstanding and there would be no protection for Heather Goodyear upon the death of the Applicant in relation to his pension if the DA was pronounced. Further, the Applicant had sent an email to Heather Goodyear&#8217;s solicitors on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2020 in which he refers to the impact of either his death or  her death on the pensions held by each of them. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">It is argued that once such issues had been raised and it being in the contemplation of the parties then the fact that the standard order was not utilised adversely impacts upon this application.  This is on the basis that there must have been a deliberate decision not to include the consent to the application to set aside. This cannot be correct. The standard wording simply states that personal representatives shall consent to the Applicant applying to set aside the order. It does not state that they will agree to the order in fact being set aside. The issue was raised before me as to whether an individual can in fact bind one&#8217;s Personal Representative in this way but that is not an issue that I need to decide. </p>

The application is now before the Court and it must be considered on its merits. The fact that the standard order was not used cannot impact upon that decision. It is always recommended to utilise the carefully draft standard orders but a failure to do so in this instance cannot prove fatal to the application.</p>

In terms of the application being successful and the pension sharing order being set aside then it is simple to state the position. The Shell pension was already in payment and the implementation of the order will significantly reduce the income of the Applicant. If the order is set aside then the whole of the pension shall remain in the Applicant&#8217;s name and his income will not be affected.  This is a defined benefits pension, and the Applicant does not have any option as to how to take the pension. As at now it can only be drawn by him as a monthly income.</p>

There is no option for an internal transfer within the Shell pension scheme. This would have had to have been an external transfer. This means that she would have had all of the freedoms that are now available to those holding such pensions. This would allow her to have used all of the funds to purchase an annuity, draw down money periodically or alternatively to have &#8216;cashed in&#8217; the full amount.  As stated (somewhat infamously) by the Pensions Minister, Steve Webb in 2015 it was the choice of the individual what to do with their pension including the option of purchasing a Lamborghini.</p>

This would mean if the pension credit was wholly &#8216;cashed in&#8217;  that the total capital available would be in the region of &#163;420,000 (this is a rough estimate as no calculations were made available during the hearing). </p>

The final correspondence from the Pension Trustees on 19 April 2022 in email form states &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">How the trustee implements the Pension Sharing Order will of course depend on what the court orders following the outcome of the application to set it aside. However if the pension sharing order is not varied as a result of that process the trustee would, having made the necessary amendments to the rules that were discussed in my email of last week, discharge its liability in line with Regulation 6(2) . By way of reminder, Regulation 6 offers the trustee a degree of flexibility to make a lump-sum payment and or a payment of a pension to one or more persons or to enter into an annuity contract or a policy of insurance for the benefit of one or more persons.     I am not in a position to confirm which of those options the trustee will choose as that is a trustee discretion. Similarly, I can&#8217;t say to whom any such benefit would be paid as that is a trustee discretion. However it may be useful to consider the list of potential beneficiaries that the trustee can choose to pay a benefit to following death as set out in the trust deed and regulations &#8211; these are the usual categories of beneficiary you would expect to see e.g. spouse, child, parents, siblings, dependents et cetera</span>&#8221;</p>

In that letter the Applicant&#8217;s solicitors state that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Under the scheme rules as they currently are (and were at the time of Mrs Goodyear&#8217;s death), the scheme rules do not provide for the implementation of the pension sharing order following the death of the recipient spouse.

However, I disagree with him as to that being what the Applicant&#8217;s Solicitors intended to convey. I understand the final sentence of the letter set out above simply means that as a result of the pension credit being returned to the pension fund as a whole if the order is not set aside then it follows that the pension credit should be retained by Mr Goodyear, but this can only occur if the set-aside application is successful. </p>

If the order is not set aside then the Pension Share would remain in place and there would be no adverse effect upon the Applicant. The only interpretation by which the Applicant could be adversely affected is if the amendment was effective and the Pension Share order was set aside. The regulations refer to: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">in the opinion of an actuary, would adversely affect any member of the scheme (without his consent) in respect of his entitlement, or accrued rights, acquired before the power is exercised</span>&#8221;.

Lord Brandon stated: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">A Court may properly exercise its discretion to grant leave to appeal out of time from an order for financial provision or property transfer made after a divorce on the ground of new events, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that new events have occurred since the making of the order which invalidate the basis, or fundamental assumption, upon which the order was made, so that, if leave to appeal out of time were to be given, the appeal would be certain, or very likely, to succeed. The second condition is that the new events should have occurred within a relatively short time of the order having been made. While the length of time cannot be laid down precisely, I should regard it as extremely unlikely that it could be as much as a year, and that in most cases it will be no more than a few months. The third condition is that the application for leave to appeal out of time should be made reasonably promptly in the circumstances of the case. To these three conditions, which can be seen from the authorities as requiring to be satisfied, I would add a fourth, which it does not appear has needed to be considered so far, but which it may be necessary to consider in future cases. That fourth condition in that the grant of leave to appeal out of time should not prejudice third parties who have acquired in good faith and for valuable consideration, interests in property which is the subject matter of the relevant order.</span>''</p>

One of the reasons put forward for applying such a discretion in this case is the failure to use the Standard order, which is dealt with above. It is to be noted however that Mostyn J adds &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">this discretion will only arise where the final order was made by consent and where the applicant is a buccaneering market trader.

As the nature of a pension can be flexible to the extent considered above, there will be cases where the pension is treated in precisely the same way as any other capital and is simply divided equally pursuant to the sharing principle. In such cases, especially if the pension is held in a SIPP, it is unlikely that the fundamental assumption was anything other than dividing the overall assets equally. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">In applications under rule 9.9A, the starting point is that the order which one party is seeking to have set aside was properly made. A mere allegation that it was obtained by, e.g., non-disclosure, is not sufficient for the court to set aside the order. Only once the ground for setting aside the order has been established (or admitted) can the court set aside the order and rehear the original application for a financial remedy. The court has a full range of case management powers and considerable discretion as to how to determine an application to set aside a financial remedy order, including where appropriate the power to strike out or summarily dispose of an application to set aside. If and when a ground for setting aside has been established, the court may decide to set aside the whole or part of the order there and then, or may delay doing so, especially if there are third party claims to the parties&#8217; assets. Ordinarily, once the court has decided to set aside a financial remedy order, the court would give directions for a full rehearing to re-determine the original application. However, if the court is satisfied that it has sufficient information to do so, it may proceed to re-determine the original application at the same time as setting aside the financial remedy order</span>.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Neither party has suggested that there should be any further hearing in this matter and have each suggested that final orders should be made. All of the information that is required to make a decision is before the Court by way of the disclosure that the original parties had made to each other. There is no known financial information about the beneficiaries but that is not relevant to consider the correct order that would have been made in January 2021, if the true factual picture was known. I am satisfied that it is appropriate and proportionate to set aside the order and substitute an alternative order.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">In the hearing it was submitted on behalf of the estate that if the Court was satisfied that the order should be set aside then it may be appropriate to amend the pension share to one of capital equalisation. This is on the basis that Mrs Goodyear had &#8216;earned&#8217; an equal share of the pension following a 38 year marriage. This would result in a percentage share of 49.5% if the post separation contributions were ignored or 45.6% if they were taken into account. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">There is no suggestion on the part of Mr Goodyear that the non-pension capital element of the order should be set aside. The argument is made that the pension, in the hands of Mrs Goodyear, is simply a different form of capital and consequently the only amendment that should be made to the order is the tweaking set out in the paragraph above.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The argument on behalf of Mr Goodyear is that the reality is that the purpose behind the pension share was to meet the income needs of Mrs Goodyear and as those needs no longer exist there should be no pension share at all. The question is posed; &#8220;Would a Judge approve a pension share Order if it was known that Mrs Goodyear would die within 6 months?&#8221; Mr Butterfield suggests that the judge would not approve such an order. It is added that Mr Goodyear would not have agreed to such an order. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">I am satisfied that, bearing in mind the hybrid nature of a pension, that both arguments are correct. Mrs Goodyear had &#8216;earned&#8217; her share of this particular pension through this long marriage, but it would also have been required to provide for her income needs at least in part. It is clearly a legitimate desire for Mrs Goodyear to be in a position to pass on the capital in which she is entitled to share to her beneficiaries, so long as the needs of the parties are met. The sole question is as to how to fairly reflect these conflicting positions in terms of a pension share.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">This was a long marriage. The pensions, taken as a whole, amounted to a larger sum than the other capital. The pensions in Mr Goodyear&#8217;s name amounted to just under &#163;1.4m whereas those in the name of Mrs Goodyear had a total CE of &#163;180,440. Is it realistic to consider that such disparity could be justified after a 38 year marriage without any pension share order being granted? If it was known that Mrs Goodyear would die within 6 months, then steps could have been taken to ensure that the external transfer occurred as swiftly as possible to permit her to convert the pension credit to a capital sum. When the flexibility of pensions is taken into account, I am satisfied that it would not have been considered a fair outcome if there was no pension share order granted.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The sole question to consider is what is the appropriate percentage for the pension share? On the basis that the order would not be made to meet the needs of Mrs Goodyear on an income basis then the relevant figures from the PODE report are those that relate to equalisation of the capital position. They are in the figures of 49.5% or 45.06% depending on whether the post separation contributions were taken into account or not. However, if either of those figures were utilised then there would be no consideration given to the fact that the income needs of Mr Goodyear would be continuing, whereas those of Mrs Goodyear would not. I am satisfied that this is a sufficient justification for there to be a departure from equality. If it was known at the time that the order was agreed that Mrs Goodyear would only live a further 6 months I consider that a significant reduction in the percentage share would have been clearly appropriate as that share of the pension which was required for her income would never be utilised.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The correct level of pension share to order is one of 25% of Mr Goodyear&#8217;s Shell pension. This will ensure that he receives some 75% of the pension income that had been earned throughout the marriage but would also provide a significant pension credit for Mrs Goodyear&#8217;s estate which will be implemented by the Pension Trustees. This will appropriately reflect the &#8216;earned&#8217; share whilst providing a &#8216;discount&#8217; for the many years over which income will not be required for Mrs Goodyear. The order is one that balances the competing arguments as to the nature of the pension asset in a way that fairly meets the income needs of Mr Goodyear and a fair sum for the estate of Mrs Goodyear.</p>
