	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application is brought by M who strongly believes that the continuation of this intervention is contrary to her mother&#8217;s (Mrs. N) best interests.  Mrs. N lacks capacity to litigate or indeed in any aspect of decision making.  Mrs. N, now 68 years old is profoundly impaired both physically and cognitively in consequence of the progressive degenerative impact of Multiple Sclerosis.  It is now 23 years since Mrs. N received her diagnosis.  It goes without saying that both the medical and legal landscape was profoundly different at that time.  Despite the fact that N has had access to some of the most eminent practitioners in the relevant areas of medicine, that has not been able to protect her from the ravages of this condition.  Multiple Sclerosis is a neurological disorder which causes myelin, the substance covering the nerves, to be destroyed.  As Professor David Neary foreshadowed in his early consultations with Mrs. N the progression of the disease varies and is very difficult to predict.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have debated whether it is strictly necessary for me to review the development of Mrs. N&#8217;s condition in this judgment.  My instinct has been to place respect for Mrs. N&#8217;s privacy and the protection of her dignity as the priority.  Ultimately however, the remorseless progression of this disorder and Mrs. N&#8217;s responses to each of the degenerative privations it has inflicted on her are part of the broad canvass of evidence which inform my ultimate decision.  It is important that my reasoning is both transparent and uncompromised.  Accordingly, I have concluded that I must, at least summarily, set out some of the key features of the medical background.  It makes distressing reading.   To see so many painful years reduced to a forensic chronology will be distressing to the family despite the fact that all the information is included within the court papers, much of it has been considered and analysed in court and of course the family have lived through it all.     </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Initially the physiological development of the disease was slow.  However, Mrs. N found the diagnosis extremely difficult to cope with, her family consider that she became profoundly depressed, she repeatedly told her son that she would &#8216;rather be dead&#8217;.  It may be that for sometime prior to her diagnosis the disorder had begun to have its effect on her general functioning.  Mrs. N&#8217;s behaviour became challenging, unpredictable and increasingly difficult for her family to cope with.  Between 1988 and 1990, Mrs. N&#8217;s relationship with her husband deteriorated dramatically leading to separation and divorce. Mrs. N, I have been told, never entirely reconciled herself to the breakdown of her marriage.  An unexpected fall in the street around the time of her divorce in 1991 led Mrs. N to consult her doctors and in due course to receive the diagnosis.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With the settlement from her divorce Mrs. N purchased a small bungalow for herself.  As I understand the history, her daughter M, then 15 years of age, moved to live with her father.  All her family told me that Mrs. N resisted her diagnosis, she refused to use her sticks, she found the Zimmer frame provided for her to be deeply repugnant.  In the home she balanced precariously between the furniture, on one occasion falling whilst alone and injuring herself significantly.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Gradually Mrs. N&#8217;s speech became slurred, a development which irritated her profoundly.  Within six years of diagnosis she became wheel chair dependant, struggled with concentration, experienced rapid mood changes and difficulties with her memory.  Her power to communicate deteriorated rapidly.  Her son (Z) bore the burden of the responsibility.  He told me in evidence that for far too long he was resistant to his mother entering a specialist unit or care home.  The situation was intolerable: Mrs. N screamed out at night disturbing and frightening her neighbours.  She was discovered, on one occasion, sitting in front of the television bleeding significantly from the back of her head without any awareness of it.  Z provided a regime of carers but Mrs. N would lash out at them aggressively both verbally and physically.  In her prime I was told that Mrs. N could be withering and coruscating in her condemnation of people, certainly the carers felt the full sting of her articulate wrath.  Perhaps unsurprisingly her friends drifted away, though her family told me that the gardener, Brian, continued to be kind and supportive and that Mrs. N thought highly of him.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is difficult to be precise about dates in this account of the background history.  The family were under strain, much of this is now a long time ago.  I remind myself that M was very young at the time.  Review of the medical records help anchor the chronology but the dates there are not always precise, being frequently dependant on a confused history.  None of this really matters because the wider picture tells its own story. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mrs. N and her family are Jewish.  Z was able to garner help from the Jewish Federation and local social services who were patient and thoughtful in their support.  Sometimes their staff were greatly challenged by Mrs. N&#8217;s behaviour.   By 1997 (i.e. only 6 years after the diagnosis) Mrs. N&#8217;s life had changed beyond recognition.  She is recorded as falling regularly at that time.  Documentation relates an incident in May 1997 in which it was thought that Mrs. N had been banging herself causing significant bruising.  Around this time Mrs. N developed difficulties with continence which, sadly, escalated quickly.  Occupational therapists endeavoured to assist and to improve access to the home but Mrs. N was resistant to help and resentful of what she regarded as an invasion of her privacy.  She loathed her wheel chair, at least initially. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By May 2000 the documentation suggests that the Jewish Federation were assisting with the possibility of identifying a care home.  It is not entirely clear what Mrs. N&#8217;s view on this option was at that stage.  By June 2000 she was regularly described as being lonely.  I note that in September 2000 the records reveal that Mrs. N could not walk to a chair, could not work her buzzer, would not use her Zimmer frame, cried a lot and was prone to falls.  Though in my judgement the situation was barely manageable, the family, especially Z, continued to try to keep Mrs. N in her own home.  They were motivated by a strong desire to preserve some semblance of independence for Mrs. N for as long as they could and, if I may say so, notwithstanding real hardship and distress to themselves.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In December 2002, the existing carers refused to return to the home, but new carers were employed.  Mrs. N continued to fall regularly.  It was often difficult for the carers to get her back into her wheelchair.  There were occasional periods where matters were more manageable.  Mrs. N responded well to the regular home care.  She tried, albeit without much enthusiasm, according to medical records, to manage the hoist for transfers. By May 2004 Mrs. N had become doubly incontinent, she was frequently in low mood, screaming, crying and hitting staff.  By October 2004 she was very weak, unable to breathe well but still extremely uncooperative.  In September 2005, a period of respite was arranged, but by March 2006 it seems Mrs. N&#8217;s behaviour had escalated such that she was considered to be violent to her carers.  She was prescribed medication for her behavioural problems and depression.  I note that the medical records reveal her to be on anti-convulsant medication to manage epilepsy.  A review by a consultant in rehabilitative medicine, Dr. F. Morcos, in September 2006, identified the following, which I summarise:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By September 2007 it was clear that Mrs. N was not taking in enough nutrition, even though she was by this time living permanently in a care home.  Her weight was 31.9Kg with a Body Mass Index of 13Kg/m2.  A swallow assessment was undertaken in October 2007.  In January 2008 a PEG tube was placed, as a mechanism for supplementing normal fluid and pur&#233;ed diet.  The modified nutritional regime enabled Mrs. N to gain weight.  Throughout 2009 Mrs. N appears to have remained at broadly the same level, though the information available is limited.  By early 2010 however, it was clear that Mrs. N had deteriorated further.  Fits were frequent, she had chronic sacral pressure sores and was treated regularly for chest infection.  On review by Dr. F. Morcos in March 2010 Mrs. N was found to be quadriplegic, having generalised spasticity, shortening of muscles in all four limbs and to be permanently in the flexor position.  Shortly before this examination MR had for the first time raised her real concern about her mother&#8217;s quality of life and general condition.  </p>

In January 2015 M was plainly desperately distressed by the extent of her mother&#8217;s condition.  She saw in her no recognition of the outside world, no interaction with any stimulus and absolutely no quality of life whatsoever.  The PEG, though functioning efficiently, had long outlived its anticipated life and there had been some discussion about its replacement.  It was, in my judgement, the prospect of this further and inevitably intrusive procedure that led M finally to conclude that the situation for her mother was intolerable and she no longer remained alive in any sentient sense.  On the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> April 2015 M issued the proceedings in the Court of Protection which have led to this hearing.</p>

On the other hand, family members may sometimes interpret simple reflexive movements as more positive interactions. They need information and support from clinicians who can explain what behaviours to look for. </span></p>

Similarly the SMART-INFORMS presents a structured framework for documenting and interpreting the observations of families and friends.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are many reasons why the observations of family members and friends concerning a patient&#8217;s level of consciousness may be mistaken.  Most commonly, as I have heard, this involves misinterpreting muscular spasm as something quite different and more significant. It is doubtless driven by hope and no doubt wishful thinking.    That said, it is often family members who spend most time and over protracted periods with the patient.  Their observations are a crucial component in the wide constellation of factors that ultimately constitute the overall assessment.   Conversely, SMART or WHIM assessments can, as here, often be undertaken at neurological rehabilitation centres by those skilled in and committed to the principles of rehabilitation and accordingly susceptible to inbuilt professional bias.  Professional enthusiasm and determination are admirable qualities and are to be nurtured, but it is important to guard against overly optimistic assessment driven by a vocational desire to try to make a difference.  These assessments tools have an inevitably subjective complexion to them.  The use of them is however now properly regarded as essential.

The history of this case shows how cases may be misdiagnosed if these tools are not used. M was initially diagnosed as being in a vegetative state. That led the family, advised by the very experienced clinicians and the independent expert instructed at that stage, to make this application. It was only some time after this application was launched that the SMART test was administered and disclosed that M was in fact in a minimally conscious state. I do not know whether or not this application would have been started if that diagnosis had been made at the outset. One can envisage cases, however, in which family members and clinicians take the view that they should start proceedings to withdraw life-sustaining treatment if, but only if, the patient is in a vegetative state.

Whilst particular attention must be paid to expressions of P&#8217;s wishes and feelings that were written down by P at a time when P had capacity, the decision maker must inquire into and then consider all other evidence of wishes and feelings before taking the decision:  see &#167;5.18 to 5.20 of the Code of Practice.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have given both these passages very considerable thought.  I draw from them only this:  where the wishes, views and feelings of P can be ascertained with reasonable confidence, they are always to be afforded great respect.  That said, they will rarely, if ever, be determinative of P&#8217;s &#8216;best interest&#8217;s&#8217;.  Respecting individual autonomy does not always require P&#8217;s wishes to be afforded predominant weight.  Sometimes it will be right to do so, sometimes it will not.  The factors that fall to be considered in this intensely complex process are infinitely variable e.g. the nature of the contemplated treatment, how intrusive such treatment might be and crucially what the outcome of that treatment maybe for the individual patient.  Into that complex matrix the appropriate weight to be given to P&#8217;s wishes will vary.  What must be stressed is the obligation imposed by statute to inquire into these matters and for the decision maker fully to consider them.  Finally, I would observe that an assessment of P&#8217;s wishes, views and attitudes are not to be confined within the narrow parameters of what P may have said.  Strong feelings are often expressed non-verbally, sometimes in contradistinction to what is actually said.  Evaluating the wider canvass may involve deriving an understanding of P&#8217;s views from what he may have done in the past in circumstances which may cast light on the strength of his views on the contemplated treatment.  Mr Patel, counsel acting on behalf of M, has pointed to recent case law which he submits, and I agree, has emphasised the importance of giving proper weight to P&#8217;s wishes, feelings, beliefs and values see <span style="font-weight:bold">Wye Valley NHS Trust v B <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2015/60" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCOP 60" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCOP 60</ref>; Sheffield Teaching Hospital Foundation Trust v TH and TR <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/4" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 4" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 4</ref>; United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust  v N <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/16" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 16" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 16</ref>.</span></p>

There will be a limited number of cases where treatment is futile, over burdensome to the patient or whether is no prospect of recovery.  In circumstances such as these, it may be that an assessment of best interests leads to the conclusion that it would be in the best interests of the patient to withdraw or withhold life sustaining treatment, even if this may result in the person&#8217;s death.  The decision-maker must make a decision based on the best interest of the person who lacks capacity.  They must not be motivated by a desire to bring about the person&#8217;s death for whatever reason, even if this is from a sense of compassion.

Decisions taken in the &#8216;best interests&#8217; of an incapacitous individual must factor in the recognition that respect for an individual&#8217;s past and present (where relevant) wishes and identifiable codes and beliefs by which he has lived are a crucial part of promoting best interests.   To subvert these to a substitution of an objective evaluation i.e. to superimpose what the Court thinks best, may result in indirect discrimination.  The central objective is to avoid a paternalistic approach and to ensure that the incapacitous achieve equality with the capacitous. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Courts have been keen to emphasise, particularly in cases involving questions of life sustaining treatment, the importance of such advance decisions complying with the form specified by statute.  The serious consequences of failure to comply have been underscored in: <span style="font-weight:bold">W v M and S and A NHS Primary Care Trust [2012] COPLR 222 and Re D [2012] COPLR 493.</span>  By insisting on correct procedural form the Courts have recognised that these measures strike a balance between the importance to be given to a competent adult&#8217;s autonomy and concern that a person could be locked into an advance refusal that he or she would wish to change but can no longer communicate.  Perhaps the most significant impact of these provisions is that they illustrate that the presumption of life, predicated on what is often referred to as the &#8216;sanctity of life&#8217; or the &#8216;intrinsic value of life&#8217;, can be rebutted (pursuant to statute) on the basis of a competent adult&#8217;s cogently expressed wish.   It follows, to my mind, by parity of analysis, that the importance of the wishes and feelings of an incapacitated adult, communicated to the court via family or friends but with similar cogency and authenticity, are to be afforded no less significance than those of the capacitous.</p>

The practical use of the term &#8216;MCS&#8217; has been, Dr. Walton tells me, connected with sudden onset severe brain injury from whatever cause.  In the context of brain injury the clinical objective is to evaluate consciousness as a foundation for rehabilitation.  As it is agreed that this is &#8216;not the case for people with progressive neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis&#8217; the terminology appears to them to be an uncomfortable fit.  </p>

VS and MCS were terms devised to be applied to patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness, irrespective of aetiology.  In simple terms there was no reason to regard differently a patient with VS or MCS according to whether their condition arose in consequence of progressive neurological disorder or acute event.  Professor Wade considered that Mrs. N&#8217;s current clinical condition is such that there is no evidence at all to suggest that she has any awareness of either her own situation or her own environment.  She is, he said, &#8216;incapable of undertaking any voluntary or willed goal-directed actions&#8217;.  There is no evidence that Mrs. N experiences pleasure, pain or distress says Professor Wade.  In court Mr. Badwan accepted that whilst there was physiological evidence of response to pain he couldn&#8217;t determine whether that had &#8216;any implications on her feelings&#8217;.  He also agreed that such is the degeneration of Mrs. N&#8217;s brain that even the capacity for pain of a physiological nature could only be very limited.

They agreed that notwithstanding their reservations about the correct terminology here that if they were evaluating a patient with sudden onset brain injury they would both consider her to be at a low level of MCS (i.e. the most severe).

Then on the other sheet the judge should write any counterbalancing dis-benefits to the applicant.

Whilst I entirely agree that some form of balance sheet may be of assistance to judges, its use should be no more than an aide memoire of the key factors and how they match up against each other. If a balance sheet is used it should be a route to judgment and not a substitution for the judgment itself. A key step in any welfare evaluation is the attribution of weight, or lack of it, to each of the relevant considerations; one danger that may arise from setting out all the relevant factors in tabular format, is that the attribution of weight may be lost, with all elements of the table having equal value as in a map without contours.</span></p>

Whilst I do not criticise Professor Wade for doing so, particularly as he supports his opinion with well respected and peer reviewed research, I am not prepared to follow him.  The research was known to the working party drafting the guidelines. The opinion articulated here by Professor Wade was a perspective clearly contemplated by the committee.  The view was however not incorporated into the guidance, I believe because the research base was as Dr. Walton suggested really rather limited.  Moreover, even cognitive functioning to this very limited degree seems to be inconsistent with the general premise of a vegetative state.  I am bound to say, that for my part,  where some level of awareness remains, however limited it may be, I instinctively consider that in such cases (whatever the label given to the condition) a decision to withdraw treatment should only be made after a full analysis of P&#8217;s best interests.  If I had accepted Professor Wade&#8217;s conclusion it would have followed, inevitably, that no such analysis was required.

Though each of them had very different relationships with Mrs. N and loved her, in different ways, none was prepared to overlook her faults, foibles and weaknesses of personality.  Mrs. N emerged as woman who could at times be capricious, selfish and seemingly shallow.  Her prevailing characteristics though came through most loudly from the evidence.

Following what was a superficial relationship with a man 10 years her senior she became pregnant.  In 1960s Britain that situation still carried a social stigma, particularly in the close knit Jewish community where she grew up.  Mrs. N&#8217;s parents were a tower of strength to her.  They gave her unfaltering support and offered Z, their grandson, the same unconditional love that they had always shown their daughter.  With the benefit of this emotionally secure foundation for herself and her baby, Mrs. N took a course which, particularly by the standards of the day, required enormous courage and resolve.  Z&#8217;s father refused to acknowledge his paternity and so Mrs. N pursued the paternity claim through the courts.  This action, which I have been told was resisted at every stage, was regarded by Mrs. N as nothing less than Z&#8217;s own basic right to have his paternity known and recognised.  She was entirely unprepared to compromise on anything less than what she perceived to be Z&#8217;s full legal recognition and entitlement to proper financial provision.  </p>

What is striking is how each of the family members I heard from wanted to tell me about this aspect of their history.  They plainly respect Mrs. N for her courage and determination and each recognises the personal cost and effort involved.  They all knew her as a woman for whom outward or public appearance was enormously important.

He told me that he was simply unable to spend or enjoy the money he was able to make.  His background had simply disabled him from this ability.  This was not said in a mean spirited or lugubrious manner, it simply showed a capacity for self reflection.  Mrs. N had no such difficulty, he told me and I realised from L&#8217;s evidence that he was able to take vicarious pleasure in his wife&#8217;s enjoyment of the income he provided.  That said I am equally sure that there were occasions where Mrs. N rather tested him with her occasional profligacy.  </p>

Sadly, they both fell victim to senile dementia in their early eighties.  </p>

Mrs. N recalls her mother saying, at the time, &#8220;if I ever get like that shoot me!&#8221;.  That is an expression that most of us have heard and quickly discounted.  M was still a young girl, and had not heard it used before.  It shocked her and has remained with her.  It may be that something of the sheer honesty of the remark communicated itself to her.

In the context of intimate conversations between a couple who had been married for 15 years this is important evidence.  L shared Mrs N&#8217;s views and told her so.

This behaviour, say the family, casts a very bright light on what Mrs. N would want for herself in her present predicament.  Few, they contend, were less well placed to withstand the ravages and vicissitudes of this degenerative disease than Mrs. N.  Each family member has, in their different way, emphasised to me that Mrs. N&#8217;s total denial of her condition, her refusal to use her stick, the Zimmer frame, the emergency buzzer and her resistance to letting carers into a home life that had once been immaculate, was not an indication of a determination to overcome the disease but a deep resistance to acknowledging its existence at all.  It was too painful for Mrs. N even to contemplate.  When the reality of her circumstances did bubble to the surface she railed in intemperate language to her son that she wanted to die.  This was now nearly twenty years ago.</p>

Without a moment&#8217;s hesitation and with one voice the entire family told me, on my enquiry, Mrs. N was a dreadful cook!  Appearance mattered a great deal to Mrs. N; it may be that this was, in part, the legacy of her teenage pregnancy.  Respectability, security and a good face to the world achieved very high importance to her.

It is not always easy to see why it is that they select particular stories.  For example, I am not sure why they have placed so much emphasis on Mrs. N&#8217;s paternity action. Certainly it reveals her feistiness but it does not translate easily into information which casts light on what she would, in her present circumstances, now wish for herself.  I have wondered whether the family wish me to infer that she is a strong enough personality to take control of how she lives out the remaining period of her life.  I have wondered whether they have highlighted this episode in her life as a counter balance to some of her more superficial pre-occupations.  Ultimately, I have regarded it as part of a picture which helps me to understand Mrs. N&#8217;s moral imperatives and the code by which she lived her life.  The family has each, in their different ways, been able to create a clear and compelling impression of who Mrs. N is and what her values were.

Views expressed prior to the onset of Multiple Sclerosis have value, it was submitted, but equally the limitations of such statements must be recognised.

With the growth in understanding about disability in recent years, however, has come an awareness that people with disability often experience profound enjoyment of life, within the limitations that their disability may impose. It is the arrogance of the able-bodied that, simply because someone is confined to a wheelchair, their enjoyment of life is restricted. On one view, the pleasures of life in such circumstances may appear smaller, but that does not mean they can be disregarded. I do not accept the submission that the absence of pain or discomfort is not in itself a positive feature of life. Comfort and contentment can be, in my view, profoundly positive sensations. Professor Turner-Stoke was inclined to rate &#8216;being comfortable&#8217; as a neutral experience as opposed to a positive one.

And another principle, closely connected, is respect for the dignity of the individual human being: our belief that quite irrespective of what the person concerned may think about it, it is wrong for someone to be humiliated or treated without respect for his value as a person. The fact that the dignity of an individual is an intrinsic value is shown by the fact that we feel embarrassed and think it wrong when someone behaves in a way which we think demeaning to himself, which does not show sufficient respect for himself as a person. </span></p>

The patient who refuses medical treatment which is necessary to save his life is exercising his right to self-determination. But allowing him, in effect, to choose to die, is something which many people will believe offends the principle of the sanctity of life. Suicide is no longer a crime, but its decriminalisation was a recognition that the principle of self-determination should in that case prevail over the sanctity of life&#8221;.</span></p>

We cannot disclaim this choice because to go on is as much a choice as to stop. Normally we would unquestioningly assume that anyone would wish to live rather than die. But in the extraordinary case of Anthony Bland, we think it more likely that he would choose to put an end to the humiliation of his being and the distress of his family.

Not only do these principles conflict, they are of a fundamentally different complexion.  The former is an ideological imperative found in most civilised societies and in all major religions, the latter requires an intense scrutiny of an individual&#8217;s circumstances, views and attitudes.
