At this hearing the wife is represented by Mr Calhaem, and the husband by Mr Webster. I do not propose, given the hour &#8211; it is now almost 4.25 &#8211; to give a lengthy judgment. I propose to give something of a summary judgment.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.08in">The background history is as follows. The husband is aged 45 and the wife is aged 28. They married in October 2007 and have one child who is aged nearly five. The marriage came to an end in 2009. The parties have been involved in litigation in England since that time, first in respect of the divorce suit, and following the dismissal of the husband&#8217;s application for a stay or a dismissal of the wife&#8217;s petition in 2010, financial remedy proceedings. The litigation has been costly. The husband has spent something in the region of &#163;200,000 and it appears that the wife has spent something in the region of&#163;250,000, a combined total of &#163;450,000. On the husband&#8217;s case, the costs substantially exceed the resources available to the parties. On the wife&#8217;s case, they total but a small percentage of the husband&#8217;s  wealth.</p>

On 5<span style="font-size:7.5pt">th </span>August 2011 this was varied to &#163;5,500 per month with effect from 1<span style="font-size:7.5pt">st </span>June 2011 and the arrears were fixed at &#163;10,200. In December 2012 the wife made an application for an order for maintenance pending suit in respect of her costs. As at the date of her statement, which was either the end of December or the beginning of January 2013, she owed her current solicitors &#163;39,000 and her costs to the conclusion of a preliminary two day hearing which was then listed for March 2013, were estimated at&#163;120,000.</p>

The wife currently owes her solicitors &#163;104,000. The amount that she seeks in respect of her costs to the conclusion of the hearing in March is &#163;122,000.

As to her own financial resources she states that her only asset is a 10% interest in her parents&#8217; property in Morocco. She asserts that this is completely illiquid and that her parents are not able to help her infunding her legal costs or, inferentially, by assisting her in realising her 10% interest in the property to which she has ascribed a value of &#163;100,000. In respect of the husband, the wife asserts that he can afford to pay the legal costs order that she seeks either from his own resources and/or from funds regularly provided to him or for him by his father.</p>

I was told that the Respondent and I had been gifted these two properties and one would be my London home and one would be my Egyptian home. In reality the properties have already been gifted to the Respondent as future family homes for when he was married. They became such when we were officially engaged and the wedding was planned.&#8217;</span></p>

There is a mortgage secured against the property in favour of RBS in the sum of approximately &#163;416,000.

Mr Webster asserts that there are no resources against which a Legal Services Order can or should be made. He further asserts that, even if there are such resources available, no payment should be made because &#8211; putting it very broadly &#8211; of the lack of merit in the wife&#8217;s claims and the expensive manner in which those claims have been litigated.

Mr Calhaem contends that this would be contrary to the overriding objective because the parties would not be on an equal footing. They would, he submits, be on a very unequal footing. He also submits that, having regard to the matters set out under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 22</ref>ZB including the issues arising in the proceedings, it would be appropriate to make an order which would enable the wife to meet her outstanding costs and her future estimated costs, namely a total sum in the region of&#163;226,000. He submits that the husband is able to pay such an order either by accessing his own resources, namely, the properties to which I have referred, and/or because of the provision that has historically been provided for him by his father. Mr Calhaem additionally argues that, because the husband has met every order which has been made against him requiring a financial payment, there is reason to suppose that he would meet any additional obligation which I might  impose.</p>

Apart from that asset, on the evidence, in my view, the wife&#8217;s case in respect the St John&#8217;s Wood Property and the Cairo Property does not appear strong and is not such as enables me to conclude, at this interim hearing, that these assets are the husband&#8217;s given that her case is based purely on oral evidence.

In his written submissions (on p. 10) Mr Calhaem has set out a schedule of the amounts asserted to have been received by the husband from K Holdings. However, most &#8211; or a significant part of those payments &#8211; appear to be at least notionally in respect of salary and a significant part of the other monies set out by the husband in his evidence are in respect of the legal fees of these proceedings and school fees.

That is a relevant consideration because the overriding objective requires me, among other things, to seek to ensure that a case is dealt with in a way which is proportionate to the nature, importance and complexity of the issues. However, the factor to which I give the strongest weight, when deciding whether or not to exercise my discretion in this case and the form in which I might exercise it, is the obligation so far as practicable to ensure or seek to ensure that the parties are on an equal footing. Having regard to the complexity and nature of these proceedings, and having regard to the fact that I am not in a position other than tentatively to draw any conclusions as to the reasonableness of the Wife&#8217;s stance (to adopt the words used by Lord Justice Wilson), in my view if it is practicable to do so I should use the power given to me by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 22</ref>ZA to make a Legal Services Order.

That led me to raise with both parties whether the wife&#8217;s legal representation could be secured by a charge being provided by the husband to her over that property. As I understand it, Mr Webster did not contend that I could not make such an order but submitted, as I have made clear during the course of the judgment, that I should not for the reasons he advanced. Mr Calhaem indicated that the wife&#8217;s solicitors were not keen on the idea of any such charge, but that if I was to adopt that route then they would seek to persuade me that I should make some allowance by way of a lump sum &#8211; and if I have written it correctly the sum was &#163;50,000&#8211; and that a number of additional provisions should be included among which were that the current mortgage should not be increased; that the judgment debt rate should apply to the amount owing; and that the charge should be realisable after the conclusion of the proceedings.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.47in">The wife and the wife&#8217;s solicitors are in a somewhat vulnerable position because they are already owed &#163;104,000. In other words costs have been incurred of &#163;83,000 without any protection at all. I reach that figure by deducting the sum of &#163;21,000, namely the amount which I concluded was left from the previous award made by Deputy District  Judge Stanton.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.47in">The total amount sought, in addition to &#163;104,000, is the estimated future costs of&#163;122,000. As set out above, I am satisfied that without any award the wife would not be able to obtain legal representation. I have come to my conclusion principally, as I have indicated, because of the complexity of the litigation and the need to ensure equality of footing. That does not mean, however, that I must exercise the power given to me by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 22</ref>ZA by simply making an order for the payment of legal services in the amount sought.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0.08in">Turning now to the amount, Mr Webster challenged the sum sought of &#163;122,000 and also questioned the costs incurred of &#163;104,000. I do not propose to award all that sum having regard to what has already been spent, because it seems  to  me  it  would  be disproportionate for me to do so. Nor do I propose to award a sum which covers all the costs which have been incurred and are owing to date. Having regard in particular to the current position, namely that the wife&#8217;s solicitors are already, and without any protection at all, owed &#163;104,000, I propose to order the husband to provide the wife a charge over the Maida Vale Property in a fixed amount to cover the payment of her legal services. I propose to limit the amount of the charge to &#163;150,000, of which &#163;100,000 is to be used in respect of the wife&#8217;s costs not currently incurred to the conclusion of the hearing and it is to be used only for that purpose, and &#163;50,000 is to be used in respect of the costs incurred to date. I will also make an order that the husband is not to increase the amount currently due to RBS and is not otherwise to dispose of or deal with his interest in the Maida Vale Property.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.48in;margin-right:0.08in">I do not propose to make any order to provide a cash sum because in the circumstances of this case I do not think that would be a fair or just exercise of the power given to me by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 22</ref>ZA. I also do not propose to include any provision  in  respect  of  interest because in my view this is a power to be used to provide for legal costs; it is not a power to be used to provide an indemnity in respect of all sums that the wife might in due course be liable to pay her solicitors.</p>
