	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have before me an application by Gloucestershire County Council seeking the committal to prison for contempt of court of Matthew John Newman. It is the aftermath of care proceedings in relation to Mr Newman&#8217;s son, who I will refer to as X, which culminated in the making by His Honour Judge Wildblood QC on 16 May 2014 of care and placement orders. An application by Mr Newman for permission to appeal against those orders was refused by the Court of Appeal (Macur LJ) at a hearing on 30 July 2014. I understand from Mr Newman that he is minded to apply for the revocation of the placement order. That is a matter for another day and another judge. I am concerned exclusively with the local authority&#8217;s application for committal.</p>

In the one case, the penal notice was prominently displayed at the end of a short, two page, order which also contained a recital that Mr and Mrs Newman had &#8220;previously received legal advice as to the implications of breaching the terms of this Order.&#8221; In the other case, the father was present and consented to the grant of the injunctions.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 26 August 2014 the local authority issued an application seeking Mr Newman&#8217;s committal for contempt. The application was supported by affidavits from five of the local authority&#8217;s employees. The matter came on for hearing before me in Bristol on 25 September 2014. The local authority was represented by Mr Benjamin Jenkins and X&#8217;s guardian by Ms Rebecca Scammell. Mr Newman appeared in person and gave evidence on oath. In an order made by Judge Wildblood on 10 September 2014, Mr Newman had been &#8220;strongly advised to seek legal representation&#8221; and told that &#8220;legal aid would be available for you to be so represented&#8221;: see <span style="font-style:italic">Chelmsford County Court v Ramet </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/56" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 56 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 56 (Fam)</ref>, [2014] 2 FLR xxx, paras 32-33. I asked Mr Newman whether he wanted legal representation and made clear that, if he did, I would be able to grant him legal aid then and there. He said that he preferred to represent himself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the afternoon of 23 September 2014, that is less than two days before the hearing, the local authority attempted to serve Mr Newman with a further application seeking his committal to prison for further alleged contempts, sending him copies of the documents by email at 15.33. Mr Jenkins sought an order that I abridge time for service, which is specified in paragraph 12.2 of PD37A as being not less than 14 days &#8220;unless the court otherwise directs.&#8221; I was not prepared to contemplate such a drastic abbreviation of time in a matter as serious as contempt and refused the order Mr Jenkins was seeking. I ensured that Mr Newman was served with all the relevant documents before he left court after the hearing. Mr Jenkins said that the local authority wished to have time to consider whether or not to pursue the further application against Mr Newman. I directed that the local authority notify the court and Mr Newman no later than 4pm on 9 October 2014 whether or not it intends to pursue the application. I reserved both that application and any further committal application by the local authority to myself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is also important to note, this being a matter of committal, that the defendant &#8211; here, Mr Newman &#8211; is entitled to make a submission that there is, in relation to any particular allegation, no case to answer. Moreover, where, as here, the defendant has chosen to represent himself, it is, in my judgment, the responsibility of the judge to consider on the papers whether there are grounds upon which, if the defendant was represented, his counsel might realistically make such a submission and, if there are, then to raise the matter with the applicant&#8217;s counsel. In relation to both ground (i) and ground (iv) I had serious doubts as to whether there was in fact even a prima facie case against Mr Newman fit to go trial, that is, a case in which it would be open to the fact-finder, correctly applying the law, to find the case proved. In relation to each of these two grounds, having explained my concerns to him, I therefore required Mr Jenkins to respond, as it were, to a submission of no case to answer. </p>

First, there was evidence from one of the social workers who had supervised contact between Mr Newman and his son on 5 August 2014 that, following this contact, a mobile phone of unknown ownership was found in the bottom of X&#8217;s changing bag. Second, there was evidence that, when a key on the phone was touched, it began intermittently sounding what was described as a siren alarm tone and the front screen of the phone displayed the following text:</p>

It was hardly to be imagined that the only people likely to pick up the phone &#8211; either a social worker or foster carer &#8211; would be so obliging as to contact Mr Newman and volunteer the information.

That general principle is clear and, indeed, long established. In my judgment a necessary application of the principle is that an order is not enforceable as an injunction unless it is directly and specifically addressed to the person or persons, or to the group or class of persons, who are intended to be bound by it. Those intended to be bound by an injunction must be clearly and unambiguously identified in the order. An injunction which fails that test, and in my judgment paragraph 2 of the order of 16 July 2014 does fail that test, is unenforceable by committal. As I put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Re HM</span>, para 17, an order which is not directly addressed to those intended to be bound by it must fail as an injunction on grounds of unacceptable ambiguity. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Jenkins sought to persuade me that paragraph 2 of the order of 16 July 2014 could nonetheless be saved. His argument proceeded in two stages. First, he submitted that, since the application that led to the making of the order had been addressed to Mr and Mrs Newman, it could properly be inferred that there was no-one else to whom paragraph 2 was addressed. There are two problems with that. First, one cannot construe an injunction by looking at other documents not specifically incorporated by reference. Secondly, the order of 16 July 2014 records the respondents as being Mrs Newman, Mr Newman and X, and it can hardly be suggested that paragraph 2 was intended to bind X. As the second stage of the argument, Mr Jenkins suggested that the word &#8220;Further&#8221; which introduces paragraph 2 of the order naturally carried one back to the preceding paragraph, which was specifically directed to Mr Newman. So, he submitted, paragraph 2 was by implication directed, as paragraph 1 clearly was, to Mr Newman, and only to Mr Newman. There is, in my judgment, a short answer to this. The word &#8220;Further&#8221; will not bear the weight which Mr Jenkins would have me attach to it. In my judgment, the requisite degree of certainty is simply not to be found in paragraph 2.</p>

For all I know, the surrounding circumstances and the history of the proceedings may demonstrate that to be most unlikely, but that is not the point.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as material for immediate purposes, paragraph 1 of the order of 16 July 2014 required Mr Newman to do two things: first, by 12 noon on 17 July 2014 to &#8220;delete the facebook account in the name of X &#8230; and all &#8216;threads&#8217; from the facebook &#8230; account in the name of X&#8221;; and, secondly, &#8220;having deleted the facebook account &#8230; and any threads, not to reactivate the account and to take all possible steps to ensure that the information &#8230; has been permanently deleted.&#8221; The fact that the material I have described in paragraph 34 above was still accessible during August 2014 demonstrates that Mr Newman must have been in breach of one or other (or conceivably both) of the relevant limbs of the order in paragraph 1. (I should add that there is no suggestion of any impossibility in his complying with the order because, as he told me, he has in fact since taken all the offending material down. Whether or not that is true, it is plainly inconsistent with any argument &#8211; and he made no such argument &#8211; that he was not able to comply with the order.)</p>

I should add, moreover, that the protection of the law is not confined to the grant in appropriate circumstances of such injunctions.
