The mistake is it was dated with the year of the applicant&#8217;s birth, rather than the year of signing.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.04in">This is another example in a regrettable line of cases where mistakes in the completion of parenthood forms (which should be overseen by the clinic providing treatment) prior to the conception of children via IVF have necessitated an application to the court to secure the legal status of the applicant in relation to the child who was subsequently born. Although this application has proceeded with no opposition the joint statement of the parties describes the impact on them of being informed of this uncertainty about the applicant&#8217;s status in relation to A. As they describe in the statement, as far as they are concerned there is no doubt in their minds that they are both A&#8217;s parents. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.04in">The statement from the Director of Nursing at the London Women&#8217;s Clinic which undertook the necessary fertility treatment in this case apologises for the error in the documentation that led to this application and any distress or anxiety caused to the family as a result. The statement confirms that the clinic has taken <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;significant measures to ensure that this error does not happen again&#8217;.</span> The statement continues <span style="font-style:italic">&#8217;Since this issue was identified we have made a number of changes in relation to the system for ensuring consent to legal parenthood is taken properly and checked. This includes more regular auditing of consent logs. Staff are also required to initial the parenthood forms after checking to ensure accountability. We also request that the PP/WP form are only completed once unless there is a significant change in circumstances between treatment such as change in partner.&#8217;</span> These changes and the assurances given are to be welcomed.  </p>

In summary this required prior to conception the completion by the parties of two forms (i) &#8216;Your consent to your partner being the legal parent&#8217; (WP form - confirming the birth mother&#8217;s agreement to the other person being treated as a parent), and (ii) &#8216;Your consent to being the Legal parent&#8217; (PP Form - confirming the other persons agreement to be treated as a parent to any child born resulting from treatment to the birth mother). </p>

Frozen embryo transfers took place in February 2016 and October 2016 which were sadly unsuccessful. A was subsequently conceived following a successful frozen embryo transfer in April 2017.

This error was not noticed by the clinic at the time, and the applicant and respondent believed that they had taken all necessary steps to secure joint legal parentage for A, as they had done for B. Following A&#8217;s birth on 12 December 2017 the applicant was registered as A&#8217;s parent on his birth certificate. </p>

As set out above, I considered such a hearing was not necessary in the circumstances of this case, due to the features set out in the preceding paragraph. Unless otherwise provided for, the court retains a discretion as to how any hearing is managed, including not having one, although such discretion can only be exercised on a case by case basis dependent on the particular facts of the case.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment the evidence demonstrates this is what is described in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span> as a Category B case in which an obvious mistake has been made in that the applicant mistakenly put her year of birth, rather than the year the document was signed. The evidence from the joint statement of the parties, supported by the statement on behalf of the clinic, describes the PP form as being signed by the applicant on 26 September 2015, which was before any treatment took place. There is no dispute as to the parties&#8217; intentions and the applicant was registered on the birth certificate. The date was otherwise correct apart from the year, which mistakenly was put as the applicant&#8217;s year of birth, rather than the year the form was signed. The court can correct that mistake through making the declaration of parentage sought.  In those circumstances there is no need to consider the alternative ground advocated by the applicant. </p>
