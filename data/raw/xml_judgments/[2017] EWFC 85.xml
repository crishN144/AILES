It is not necessary to set out a large amount of detail as there is a case summary which I approve and have attached as an annex to this judgment.  That summary sets out the relevant history and provides cross references to the papers before the court today. Before going on to say any more I would like to express the courts enormous gratitude to the parties in the case, in particular the allocated social worker Ms Pierce and MGM, for all they have done to make sure this hearing could go ahead and be a final hearing. As a result of all their efforts there is no further delay in securing the final long term care arrangements for TG </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">These proceedings were started by Brighton and Hove City Council (&#8216;the local authority&#8217;), due to their concerns that the care TG was receiving from her parents placed her at risk of significant emotional and physical harm. In summary, this risk was due to the volatile and unstable relationship between the parents, their use of drugs and the mother&#8217;s inability to consistently take up the support that was offered to her or finally separate from the father. The local authority provided considerable support to the mother to try to help her provide safe care for TG, but by July the risks of significant harm to TG became too high due to the mother&#8217;s behaviour and they sought, and were granted, an interim care order so they could place TG with foster carers, where she remains. The parents have had some contact with TG but, sadly, have not been reliable about when they have attended. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Following assessments of the parents, the local authority concluded that TG should not return to either of her parents&#8217; care. In addition, they undertook assessments of the wider family. The wider family included MM&#8217;s mother, MGM, who is TG&#8217;s maternal grandmother. MGM lives in The Gambia. The initial assessment was over the telephone, a more in depth assessment was undertaken by an independent social worker, Ms Coker, who visited MGM at her home, spoke to her referees and undertook other enquiries regarding the care MGM could provide. Ms Coker&#8217;s two detailed reports provide a comprehensive assessment of MGM&#8217;s ability to provide long term care for TG. Ms Coker makes a clear and reasoned recommendation that TG&#8217;s welfare would be met by being placed in the long term care of MGM in The Gambia.</span></p>

However, they failed to comply with directions from the court to file a statement setting out what they proposed, and did not participate in updated drug tests. As recently as a few days ago, the police had to be called due to arguments between the parents. The current position is they are separated again. The mother now supports TG&#8217;s placement with her mother. This was confirmed by the mother who attended court today. She said her separation from FF is final, she is working and, as her counsel Mr Campbell put it, is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;getting her life back together&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> FF has not been in touch with his solicitors since 3 November, despite their efforts to contact him. He knew of these hearing dates, as he was in court in November when they were fixed.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The proposal of the local authority is to place TG in MGM&#8217;s care under a Special Guardianship Order (&#8216;SGO&#8217;) pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 14</ref>A <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and for her to be given leave to remove TG from the jurisdiction to live permanently in The Gambia. The court is invited to make an SGO of its own motion pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 14</ref>A (6) (b). This provides the court can make such an order where the court is considering family proceedings (such as the care proceedings issued by the local authority) if the child&#8217;s welfare requires such an order to be made. Although this does not require MGM to apply for leave to make a SGO I am satisfied if she had needed to make such an application it would have been granted. As TG&#8217;s maternal grandmother she has a close connection with her, MGM&#8217;s position is supported by the local authority and whilst there will be some disruption to the child by what she proposes, TG would not be harmed by it. An SGO will give MGM parental responsibility, which she will share with the parents but pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 14</ref>C (b) she can exercise that parental responsibility to the exclusion of any other person with parental responsibility. It is what has been called enhanced parental responsibility; that is the final decision as between her and the parents regarding the exercise of parental responsibility in relation to TG rests with her. She is able to override the exercise of any parental responsibility by the parents. </span></p>

As described in more detail in Ms Coker&#8217;s assessment TG will live with her in the family home. MGM is 58 years, her husband died in 2005. They had three children, her other two children live and work in Canada although visit The Gambia at least once a year. Two of her nieces currently live with her and she has domestic support in the home. Following her husband&#8217;s death in 2005 she receives a pension from his employment, with additional support from two of her children who live in Canada. Details as to the available schooling are set out in Ms Coker&#8217;s report and in her statement MGM details the school she has chosen for TG to attend. MGM recognises the importance of the parents in relation to TG&#8217;s identity but it also alive to their respective failings as regards their care of TG. Ms Coker&#8217;s report is very positive and concludes that the care MGM proposes is highly child-centred and will help address any earlier omissions of care TG may have experienced whilst in her mother&#8217;s care. </span></p>

Inevitably there will be a change for her being placed in MGM&#8217;s care and moving to another jurisdiction but it is quite clear MGM has sensitively considered the right care for her, made plans in relation to schooling and will be able to provide the long-term stability within the wider family that meets TG&#8217;s best interests. Of course, a consideration is that, by placing TG out of the jurisdiction (in The Gambia) will limit the opportunities she will have for direct contact with her parents, but I am satisfied that the arrangements for future contact for TG with her parents will be honoured by MGM. She recognises the importance for TG, in relation to her own identity, of the need for her to grow up being fully aware of how she came to be placed with her and the background and circumstances of her parents. That security and stability that MGM can offer outweighs any loss of opportunity of additional direct contact with her parents.</span></p>

She would continue to have contact with her mother, and maternal aunt and uncle. This will benefit TG&#8217;s emotional and psychological needs.

The wardship would be a temporary measure and for its duration, the child could be directed to live with her grandmother and there could be orders providing some protection against removing the child from the care of the grandmother.</p>
