By 2001 they had separately migrated to Denmark where in that year they married. The mother already had a daughter by an earlier marriage whom I will call E and who is now 18 and has always made her home with the mother. The parents while in Denmark had 3 sons whom I will call A (now 14), B (just 12) and C (just 11).</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">In 2005 the family moved in stages to Bristol, the mother and the then 4 children preceding the father by some months. The father's assertions at various points in his written and oral evidence that the mother's move with the children was unilateral and without his consent, and that upon his delayed arrival in Bristol he lived at a separate address, are blatant untruths. The reason why he might wish to conceal the truth about their cohabitation and the rationale for asserting that he somehow occupied what he described as an accommodation address elsewhere (a friend's flat where on his own evidence he never stayed more than a night or two at a time) may have to do with his (and indeed the mother's) benefits situation. And although that sort of consideration may have been behind others of his falsehoods it does not provide a motive for by any means all of them. His evidence, as will be observed, is littered from start to last in writing as from the witness box in inconsistency, contradiction and internal confusion.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">There can be no doubt that whatever the mother's reasons for the move from Denmark to Bristol the father knew about it in advance and did not seek to prevent it. The hold-up for him was the need to await the grant of Danish citizenship and the availability of a Danish passport which would enable him to travel abroad without anything by way of hindrance. In fact the mother's explanation for her move is that it was motivated partly by desire to secure better employment but also to separate because of her increasing unhappiness in a marriage which she has described as abusive in a number of ways. I believe her when she says that notwithstanding that unhappiness and, as the future would prove, not for the last time upon his arrival in Bristol he simply moved into the home which she had established there with the children and over a period she made the best of a bad job and they were reconciled.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">The family lived in Bristol until 2010. It is my clear impression that the mother was their financial mainstay, her earnings from multiple employment augmented by state benefits. The father worked sporadically, probably to a lesser extent than he would have me believe but probably also somewhat more than what the mother claims was hardly at all. He worked in hairdressing salons and in security and it may well be in other relatively menial roles. He did lend a hand in caring for the children at times when they were not at school and their mother was at work but clearly she was their prime caregiver. During this period their youngest child, a girl F now aged 7, was born.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">There either was or was not an incident of serious physical violence perpetrated by the father on the mother during the autumn of 2009 (or it may have been 2010: neither parent is a particularly accurate historian). I am in fact satisfied that the father threatened mother with a knife and struck her head against a door or wall in the presence of at least some of the children, including in particular E who was then about 12 or 13. The father's denial is unconvincing. I had written and oral evidence from E, who clearly is in her mother's camp but was nevertheless appreciative of some aspects of the father's behaviour towards the children. That did not however extend to this occasion, and I found convincing and accept as accurate her recollections of the anxiety she felt to protect her younger siblings (as she regarded them and they her) from the impact of what she observed and from the risk of fallout from the aggression manifested by the father.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">I am also persuaded of the cogency of what the mother relates as the sequel: the police attended and she made a statement and the father might well have been prosecuted, but she was prevailed upon by the elders of her community to withdraw her complaint, and they brokered at her insistence the father's agreement that he would allow her to go and live elsewhere and separate from him. It was that which, she says and E corroborates, led to the move of the family, again initially without the father, to Birmingham. The father denies the involvement of the police and the elders of the community and would have me believe that they all moved amicably to Birmingham together at the insistence of the wife who wished to leave Bristol.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">The father says that he constructively participated in the transportation of household belongings to their new home in Birmingham in about September 2009 (or possibly 2010). The mother and E maintain the contrary and I prefer their evidence. But once again the father having discovered their whereabouts had moved in with the family by about the end of the relevant year. And again after a period they became reconciled and resumed living together.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">It was in August 2011 that the family's departure from England for Dubai and thence to stay in Somalia took place wherein lies the kernel, at least jurisdictionally, of this litigation. For A and B, the two older boys, and the young F remain there being looked after at present by the father's sister whom I will call G while both their parents remain here in England. The mother's aspiration is to have the children returned to England where she as their primary carer for most of their lives hopes they would settle with her and their sister E, and their youngest brother C who intermittently since about November 2012 has lived with the mother in this country. The father however invites me to say, assuming that I do find there is jurisdiction, that I should not exercise it in any event, and if I do do so that I should not make an order for those children's return to this country.</p>

At that time the mother had recently returned to England after about four months in Somalia and was living apart from C (who had been in England since November 2012 in circumstances I shall describe) whom the father in her absence had frequently left for periods of up to a week in the care of a nephew's wife in Birmingham. The mother however became aware in October 2014 that the father was in this country and this it was that prompted her to issue proceedings. In response to a without notice application made on behalf of the mother on 22 October 2014 Cobb J made a tipstaff location order in respect of the father and the child C. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">The mother's statement signed the same day contained serious errors of fact which, in particular, would leave the reader with the impression that the family had been living in England throughout from 2005 until the father had removed A, B and F from her care in Somalia the very previous month, she having been the one who had taken them there in April 2014 "to ensure they were safe".</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">The mother's statement was clearly prepared in haste, at least in respect of some of the very recent events it narrates. Nothing like the full extent of this family's comings and goings, its separations and its realignments, was deployed. I have to say that even with the assistance of the chronology compiled at leisure and with care for this hearing I have found it difficult to be quite sure who was where with whom at what date over the period since August 2011. This has been for the adults but in particular for the children a complex, contradictory and often bewildering odyssey. I say this not in exoneration of the mother but in recognition of how difficult it must have been for her legal advisers, through an interpreter, to obtain full and in particular less inaccurate instructions. The fact remains however that the mother did sign the statement to signify its accuracy.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">The difficulty I have in seeking to establish the extent to which the mother at this stage misled her advisers deliberately, and thus the court, is compounded by the fact that no adequate steps were taken in relation to the preparation and authentication of the contents of this, and many of the other statements prepared in this case on both sides for other witnesses.</p>

At my suggestion and with his approval the postscript in relation to the preparation of statements from witnesses who do not speak English which he appended at [56] to [61] of that judgment is reproduced at the conclusion of this in the hope that it may be better observed than, certainly in my limited but consistent experience, has been its fate since its guidance was given. Without clarity concerning the provenance of such a statement it is a far more difficult task to assess what weight can be given to it and, in particular, what may be the reasons why on examination it proves to be short on accuracy.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">In fact, in this mother's case, she does in a later statement go some way to acknowledge that she did not initially understand the imperative need to maintain accuracy in her written evidence. And in the event her lapses in this regard do not, I believe, prevent me on broader grounds from assessing where as between her and the father on important issues I am to find relevant truth.</p>

I am certainly unable to lend any credence to his attempt at an explanation from the witness box when he was reminded (and he did indeed appear not to remember) that that was indeed his case not quite a year ago. What has changed since then, and what he invited me to conclude would justify his volte face, was the increased strength of the children's wishes not to be returned to this country or to their mother. I will have to reach conclusions as to how that has come about at a later point in this judgment.</p>

According to this lady she had never met C before the night before, a fact I shall bear in mind when considering the weight I should attach to the father's insistence that the children should not be looked after in Somalia and in particular should not travel by plane other than in the company of his sister or some other close member of his family: and should not be entrusted to any member of the mother's family, even one whom they might well already know well.</p>

A procedural step of significance was that on the father's application assistance was sought from an independent social worker resident in Nigeria, Henrietta Coker. She was appointed Guardian to all four children. Through refusal of funding she was unable to visit the children in Somalia but did eventually speak to them once by telephone. She conveyed the clarity of certainly A's and to an extent B's expressed hostility to the mother, as well as her views as to the apparent lack of objective justification for those feelings and as to their provenance.

I must also pay tribute to the two interpreters who certainly gallantly and so far as I can tell accurately conveyed the gist of what we lawyers all on occasion rather too swiftly or too lengthily expressed, as well as what both the mother and the father said and understood. For both parents relied on the interpreters for an understanding of what else was said and done in court. It was in part the need to attempt to go at the speed of the interpreters which not unexpectedly led to the prolongation of this hearing, plus (I would observe) the tendency of the father to extend his answers into areas often little germane to the question put.

Then, while they were in Dubai, the father suggested that they should go and see relations in Somalia for a short period not least so that they might meet the youngest child F for the first time. But on arrival he put the family passports in a safe at a Bosasso hotel, the Rooble Hotel, owned by his family and said that the children should stay in Somalia for a year or two to learn about their culture and traditions.</p>

She comes from a cultural and traditional background and is of a faith which makes her inclined to be submissive, and particularly vulnerable to what I am satisfied has been this father's bullying and controlling behaviour towards her and the children. She is a quietly-spoken traditional Somali wife and mother. I am not suggesting that I have total confidence in everything which in evidence she told me, but her case was hugely more consistent then the father's. He seemed dismissive if not indeed indifferent to the consequences of his actions so far as the children's emotional relationships and schooling and concerns about their health were concerned: there are schools and doctors everywhere in the world, he told me. The mother in contrast gave her evidence reasonably clearly and relatively consistently, certainly during her lengthy time in the witness box. Her affection for the children and her grief at being separated from them (and in particular from the youngest, F) were patent.</p>

It is trite that there are all kinds of reasons why witnesses lie, but where the issues relate, as here, to failed marital relationships and the strong emotions and passions that the court process itself releases and brings into prominence in such a case, the reasons why someone in the mother's position may lie, even lie repeatedly, are more than usually difficult to decipher. Yet through all the lies, as experience teaches, one may nonetheless be left with a powerful conviction that on the essentials the witness is telling the truth, perhaps because of the way in which she gives her evidence, perhaps because of a number of small points which, although trivial in themselves, nonetheless suddenly illuminate the underlying realities.'</span></p>

Secondly, it makes provision for that retained jurisdiction to come to an end (hereafter "the ending of jurisdiction provisions"). What troubled CAFCASS was that it would, in their view, be unsatisfactory, where the child has been taken to live somewhere outside the European Union, to have a retained jurisdiction without any provisions to bring it to an end. If the wording of Part 10 were to be given its natural meaning, this is what the position would be, because the requirements for the ending of jurisdiction includes the child has acquired a habitual residence in "another Member State".</span></p>

To decide that there is jurisdiction is not, of course, the same as deciding their jurisdiction will be exercised. That is a separate question, to which I will return.'</span></p>

For I am left in no doubt that the potential advantages of the removal of these children to England, or indeed of any of them should A remain adamant that he will not return, outweigh by a large margin the deficits inherent in their current situation. It is overwhelmingly in their best interests that orders to bring about that outcome should be made, and appropriate steps taken to encourage their father not simply to stand by and watch but positively to take the steps open to him to facilitate their return. </p>
