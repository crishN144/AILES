There are at least 6 orders made by judges prior to the allocation of the case to MacDonald J in mid-2022, and there are 9 orders in the bundle that I have been given which have been made by him between 17 August 2022-18 December 2023.  </p>

The judge directed that the further application which was issued via a Form N244 should be listed before me today.</p>

He provided a very detailed 34 page skeleton argument and addressed me at length today.  He raised many arguments and I will only deal with those that appear to me to be relevant to this particular application.  This judgment has to be produced with expedition as there is a 2 day hearing fixed to commence on Monday, today being Wednesday.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background of the case is that an order in a substantial sum was made for child support in the home State of the mother, Colorado.  That order was registered by an order made on 29 April 2021 by the Family Court at Leyland (Lancs) by two justices attended by a legal representative by the name of Mr Dodgshon.  The father strongly challenges the correctness of the registration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Shortly before the hearing fixed for 29 November 2023 CD says that he was provided with documents by Mr Keenan, an administrative officer within the MEBC.  Those documents revealed to him the existence of communications which, he says, involved MacDonald J without the knowledge of CD, and which he argues give rise to the allegation of apparent bias.  In the repeated phrase of his advocate brother, there were &#8220;ex-parte interactions&#8221; between the judge and third parties which were not reported to CD which makes the judge&#8217;s recusal mandatory.</p>

The judge replied through his clerk that he had not been able to locate any record of communications between himself and Mr Dodgshon and that the email sent in November 2022 to the Clerk of the Rules office arrived at the time that he had a temporary clerk.

If so, his remedy is to seek to appeal against that decision. Alternatively, he may argue that the judge&#8217;s treatment of his case was unfair over the course of the proceedings and that he should therefore recuse himself. In those circumstances, however, it is necessary to consider the whole of the proceedings to determine whether the judge&#8217;s approach to the aggrieved party has been unfair.

In that case there had been multiple communications between a circuit judge and a district judge about the appeal of the district judge&#8217;s order which was being heard by the circuit judge.  The whole set of communications was directly about the substance of the appeal.  The Court of Appeal said that notwithstanding that the court centre in which the proceedings took place might be small, it was essential to keep a Chinese wall.  I did not find this case to be a helpful analogy as there has been no suggestion that any of the communications involving MacDonald J went to the substance of the matter before him, which was the appropriateness of the registration.  </p>

TD, who had done prodigious research on the matter as his skeleton argument shows, was unable to direct me to any English authority but referred me to State of Illinois Judicial Enquiry Board Code of Judicial Conduct.  This is plainly of no binding authority upon me.  I accept that it provides that to avoid the need for recusal the judge should make provision promptly to notify the parties of the substance of any ex-parte communication and give the parties an opportunity to respond.  This applies even to communications for scheduling or administrative purposes and which does not address substantive matters.</p>

Judges are referred a huge amount of (normally) email traffic relating to the management and listing of cases.  These may or may not be referred to the parties.  Each communication has to be judged on its merits.</p>

It is difficult to analyse them in the absence of any memory by the judge, although that is not surprising, it being over a year ago.  The communication of 5 October 2022 would in itself be unsurprising coming from a junior judicial officer to his Family Division Liaison Judge (now Presider).  There can be no objection to the judge having told the Legal Advisor not to correspond with a party until the appeal had been determined (I suspect a more likely piece of advice than that recorded in the letter, namely not to respond until the case had been listed, particularly in the light of the next paragraph which refers to the notification of the outcome).</p>

I do not read the communication as being obstructive of CD&#8217;s application or ability to apply.</p>

It seems to me perfectly proper for HMCTS to inform the court that they have not yet responded fully to CD&#8217;s letter as they are waiting a reply from the disclosure team.  The attachment of supporting correspondence to that effect adds nothing to the harmlessness of the communication.</p>

Judges frequently are asked by lower court judges whether or not an appeal has been heard, and, if not, when it will be heard, and the provision of such information is entirely proper for the smooth running of the wheels of justice.  In any event, the parties had themselves already received notice of the hearing date.</p>
