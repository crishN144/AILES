That remained her clear recommendation to me.  The father&#8217;s plan or proposal would, she accepted, promote a greater degree of paternal contact and separation &#8220;would be significant&#8221; for A.

If the mother were to be prevented from leaving the jurisdiction, her unhappiness and frustration might impact upon her care of A and perhaps the other children as well.  Her overdose/attempted suicide of December 2015, when the mother was depressed about the impending return to the United Kingdom, was an indicator of potential difficulty.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The impact upon the mother of a refusal might be very significant.  She would be extremely unhappy and X and Y&#8217;s reaction would probably compound her distress.  The mother might regain her equilibrium and come through, but equally she might not.  Her whole family life would be disrupted.  The years ahead in this country could well be very difficult and, in this way, A might suffer also.</span></p>

That regular contact, when compared with less frequent block contact, is of course very different.  I do not wish to minimise this loss for the father and I understand he might well be aggrieved after the events of last year, following the first decision by District Judge Sethi.</span></p>

A&#8217;s circumstances in the United States are more likely to provide a secure and stable upbringing in the domestic environment proposed there by her mother, when compared to the alternative for the mother in this jurisdiction.  Accordingly, in these circumstances, the best option is also the most proportionate outcome.</span></p>

I do not pretend that this will be a substitute for the current arrangements, but they do provide for his continued involvement in A&#8217;s future life.  I accept the mother and the stepfather&#8217;s solemn assurances given in this court that they will facilitate the birth father&#8217;s contact, recognising its importance.  I conclude that the mother and the stepfather, operating within the parameters of the law, have no justification for withholding the father&#8217;s contact as they did when they operated outside the parameters of the law last year.</span></p>

As she grows in maturity, so will her understanding of her circumstances increase and her contact provision with her father will require modification.  </span></p>

They plainly love her very much.  They were able to communicate with each other in arranging contact and there are grounds for future optimism, as the events of recent months hopefully fade into the background.</span></p>
