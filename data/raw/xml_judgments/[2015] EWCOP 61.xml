		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;The allegations made towards my brother Paul are unfounded. We had a best interest meeting on the 13th March with the Social Services and it was decided by myself, Social Services, my sister Susan, my brother Paul, the CPN and the psychiatric doctor, that it would be in our mum&#8217;s best interest to remain at [the care home]. Stephanie did not attend this meeting. My mum is allowed to keep &#163;22 per week. The home is paid by direct debit from my mum&#8217;s bank account and topped up by Croydon Council. I came back from Spain on the 11th April and my mum&#8217;s villa is not being rented out. The villa is in my mum&#8217;s and brother&#8217;s name. Social Services have the proof of this. This has been an ongoing thing with Stephanie. Stephanie has only visited my mother 4-6 times in four and a half years. I don&#8217;t believe Stephanie has my mum&#8217;s best interest at heart and the only reason she wants my mum moved is because she has caused problems at the care home. On one incident the police were called.&#8221;</p>
