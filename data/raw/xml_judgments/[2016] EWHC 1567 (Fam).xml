The essential background facts and context appears to be as follows.   The applicant mother is British and her home and background are here in England.  The respondent father is American.  His home and background appear to be entirely in America.  However, he was formerly serving in the American military, and it was whilst he was based as an American soldier in Germany that he and the mother first met.  They were able to marry in April 2011 by proxy in Montana, USA (proxy being recognised in America in the case of their military serving abroad).  At that time, the mother continued to live in England.    But in March 2012 the father was posted back to America.  The mother travelled there and began living with him.  It must have been very shortly after that that the one child of the relationship was conceived, since he was born in December 2012.</span></p>

If what she says is true, he was well aware that she had booked one-way tickets, for he saw them.    He, himself, drove her and the child to the airport, and the plan was that he would soon travel to England himself to join them here.  Further, when she, herself, returned to Georgia during May 2013, he had an obvious opportunity to assert, if it was true, that she had &#8220;absconded&#8221; with or abducted the child, but he did not in any way avail himself of that opportunity. </span></p>

It follows that the child was aged about 3 months when he first travelled to England with the mother.  He has now lived, in a settled way, at the same address in England, with his mother, for over three years and, effectively, therefore, for the whole of his life.  His mother is a British citizen.  His father is an American citizen.  He himself has dual nationality and both British and American passports.  </span></p>

Frankly, it is quite unnecessary for me to incorporate into this brief judgment any of the relevant jurisprudence.  On the facts as alleged by the mother, the essence of which I am quite satisfied is true, it is as plain as a pikestaff that this child has been habitually resident here for a long time now.  He was habitually resident here on 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February 2016 and, indeed, is still habitually resident here today.</span></p>

It is only relatively recently, namely during late January 2016, that the mother became aware at all of the proceedings to which I am about to refer.  She has subsequently been able to obtain a number of documents from the Superior Court of Gwinnett County.  From those documents, the following appears to be the case.   In May 2015, lawyers called Taylor Made Legal Solutions LLC filed or presented, in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County, a complaint for divorce on behalf of the father, naming the mother as the defendant.  That complaint states that, at that date, the plaintiff husband was, himself, a resident of the State of Texas, but that:</span></p>

He knew where she was residing here in England, for initially he was in communication with her here in England.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The next matter with which I must deal is the question of service of these English proceedings upon the father.  There are, within the bundle now before me, no less than three &#8220;Affidavit of Process Server&#8221; made by a process server based in Houston, Texas, namely Mark A. Whitmore, who swears that on each of 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> March, 29</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> April and 16</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June 2016 he personally served upon the father all the significant documents in these proceedings, including documents giving him notice of the previous interlocutory hearings and of the place, time and date of this hearing before me today.  That evidence alone suffices to justify and, frankly, require me to conclude and be satisfied that the respondent has indeed been properly and personally served with all the relevant documents and due notice of these proceedings and of this hearing.  </span></p>

Additionally, emails have been sent to what are believed to be the current email addresses of the father.  There has not been the slightest response by or on behalf of the father to any of these communications.  It is indeed a matter of some regret that it appears that Warren Taylor and/or Taylor Made Legal Solutions did not, at least in the most formal of ways, extend the professional courtesy to colleague English solicitors of acknowledging their email.  At all events, on the basis of all the material to which I have referred, I am quite satisfied today that the father has been served with notice of the present proceedings and with notice of this hearing, and appears deliberately to have made no attempt whatsoever to engage with, or participate in, these proceedings.  </span></p>

It may be that it is in his longer-term best interests to have contact with, and a relationship with, his father, but that ball, frankly, is firmly in the court of the father.  He knows where the mother is.  He has known for several months now of the contact details of, and involvement of, the mother&#8217;s English solicitors.  He has not made the slightest effort or step to engage or seek contact.  I have not the slightest reason to suppose that the mother is not, meantime, caring properly and well for this child.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">On that basis, and for the above reasons, I will make an order today which includes a declaration that the child concerned was, in December 2015 (being the date of the American order) and in February 2016 (being the date of the commencement of these proceedings), and still is habitually resident in England and Wales and, accordingly, that the courts of England and Wales do have jurisdiction to make orders concerning matters of parental responsibility in relation to this child.  Further, I will order that he shall live with his mother.  I will order that the father is forbidden and prohibited, whether by himself or by instructing or encouraging any other person, from removing the child from the care of his mother or from the care of any person to whom the mother may, from time to time, delegate the care of the child, including any childminder, nursery or school, or from England and Wales.  It is, of course, always open to a respondent to an application such as this to make a further application himself to this court in relation to the child, but I will provide that any such application must be made on notice to the mother and, in the first instance, to the High Court of Justice sitting here, at the Royal Courts of Justice in London.</span></p>

In addition (but, I stress, not by way of service), copies of the order and of this judgment must be sent electronically to Taylor Made Legal Solutions for their information and also to the Superior Court of Gwinnett County in the State of Georgia for the information of that court.  It seems to me important also that, in the event of any further proceedings in that court, that court should be aware of the full narrative case of the mother as set out in her statement made in these proceedings on 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February 2016.
