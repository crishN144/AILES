	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2018 I handed down a judgment allowing an appeal by the husband against an order of Her Honour Judge Hughes QC dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2017.  I will not repeat the terms of that judgment but its contents are to be imported into this judgment.</p>

The parties agreed that rather than remit the case I should retain it and an order was made requiring the wife by 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2018 to serve a statement containing a breakdown of all her current capital assets, her liabilities, her income from all sources and her outgoings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I had anticipated this hearing coming back before me in March 2018.  It is a matter of regret that that has not happened, largely as I understand it due to counsel&#8217;s commitments.  But, there has been one fortunate development, namely that at the date of the hearing on 21 June the former matrimonial home known as RG was under offer with an anticipation that exchange would take place very speedily with completion by 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2018.  I circulated the draft judgment about one week after the hearing but was then asked by both sides not to hand it down until there had been completion which was delayed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My draft judgment assumed that the wife would receive between &#163;100,000 - &#163;200,000 in respect of 22 acres land owned by the parties adjacent to the property and from the sale of various chattels.  In fact, she has received some &#163;125,000 as they were sold to the RG purchaser.  There may be an overage payment if the purchaser obtains planning permission for the land. Neither party has suggested that this receipt and/or potential benefit should alter the outcome that I indicated in the draft judgment and I do not propose to alter the judgment or schedule to reflect its receipt.  I have little doubt that some of the money will go on the increased legal fees that she will have incurred and the surplus is de minimis.</p>

It is calculated that if the villa were to sell for &#163;1.75m, which is optimistic, the sum that she would owe to the husband would be about &#163;170k on the basis that her liability is not paid from the sale proceeds of RG (see below).</p>

That proposal is sensible and realistic.  It means that the wife will have her money in before she has to pay out.  It has the added benefit that upon the sale of RG the monthly payments made by the husband in respect of the loan of &#163;12k per month and the mortgage repayments will come to an end.  It was agreed that the wife will become self-sufficient from the date that the sale went through. </p>

He says that if she was to use all the capital available to her as a Duxbury fund, being about &#163;2.14m (&#163;2.314m minus the shortfall of about 170k she would still owe the husband after receiving her share of the Spanish property and repaying her debt to him in full) she would be able to receive an income fund of something approaching &#163;110k pa.
