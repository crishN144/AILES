	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have been hearing an appeal against the order of Recorder Chandler KC dated 6 September 2022.  On 3 March 2023, Morgan J gave permission to appeal on four out of the six grounds raised.  The appeal has been conducted on the basis of the written documentation and oral submissions alone.  </p>

I said that I considered the litigation in that case was one of the most regrettable pieces of litigation I had ever come across.  The costs there were entirely out of proportion and, in all probability, ruinous to the future financial well-being of the parties.  Exactly the same can be said of the litigation in this case.  I take the view that it could not have been handled more disastrously if the parties had tried to do so.  There is no doubt whatsoever that, regardless of the merits of the appeal, virtually the entire blame for that lies with the Appellant.</p>

The Appellant says it was considerably later, but I do not need to resolve the issue as it is not relevant to what I have to decide.  They married on 30 September 2016.  Their matrimonial home was a property in Beckenham, Kent but they also owned two other properties in London.  </p>

The Respondent&#8217;s case was that the intention was to continue on to China.  In any event, Hayden J made a summary return order on 21 May 2019 and the Respondent collected K from America the following day.  Since then, K has lived with the Respondent but there is an order made by Hayden J on 13 January 2021 for the Appellant to have contact to K six days out of every fourteen.  As the Appellant now lives in China, it is hard to see how he can take up all of this contact.  I was told that he has seen K for approximately five weeks this year, which is around one week per month, in blocks of contact, which is clearly sensible.  </p>

In his Form E, the Appellant deposed to a net income of &#163;11,613 per month. He is employed in a business that recruits office staff. The parties reached an agreement on the application on 14 April 2020.  Chandler DDJ, as he was then, made an order in the terms of the agreement on 14 July 2020.  In his statement of information for the court,  dated 24 June 2020, the Appellant said that his net income was &#163;9,866 per month, made up of &#163;1,750 per month from China and &#163;8,116 per month from Hong Kong.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The consent order dated 14 July 2020 dealt with capital issues as well as income.  Whilst I am not directly concerned with the capital arrangements, it is right to note that the family home in Beckenham and a further property were both sold, with the Respondent receiving the vast majority of the proceeds of sale of both properties to enable him to rehouse himself and K.  The Appellant retained the third property, a flat in Canada Water.  There was an interim order as to maintenance, pending the sale of the properties.  Thereafter, the Appellant was to pay to the Respondent for the benefit of K periodical payments at the rate of &#163;2,900 per month until K finished Year 2 of Primary School.  He was then to pay &#163;2,400 per month until the commencement of Year 7.  Thereafter, he was to pay &#163;1,900 per month.  There was a nominal spousal periodical payments order in the sum of &#163;1 to increase if a CMS assessment was obtained in a lower figure than the maintenance. It is right to note that there was a recital that it was acknowledged and recorded that the Covid-19 pandemic may negatively impact both parties earned income and, in those circumstances, may make it necessary to review and vary the periodical payments.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Appellant applied to vary the periodical payments and remit arrears in the autumn of 2020.  I have found three separate dates for this application in the papers, namely 6 October 2020, 25 October 2020 and 30 November 2020 but the exact date does not matter.  Whichever date is taken, a court is entitled to be highly circumspect about such an early application.   The Appellant sought an order that the payments be halved on the basis his income had fallen to &#163;6,030 per month in May 2020.  It is, of course, noteworthy that his statement of information for the consent order giving a figure of &#163;9,866 per month was dated a month later than May 2020.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">By 12 January 2021, the Appellant was saying that he was only working part-time, three days per week.  The reason given was the effect of the Covid pandemic on his employers and his health, as he was suffering from hypertension and myocardial ischaemia.  He said that his income had, in consequence, further reduced to &#163;4,011 per month net.  From this point, he paid periodical payments of &#163;500 per month rather than the sum of &#163;2,900 pursuant to the order.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Judgment was handed down on 14 September 2021.  She refused the application and was very critical of the Appellant.  She noted that he divides his work between China and Hong Kong.  The Respondent is employed part-time as a business developer manager.  The Judge found that the Appellant had deliberately sought to mislead both the Respondent and the court as to his financial circumstances.  The Appellant had told her that he had committed to the consent order because he had believed that the reduction in his salary would only be temporary.  She said that the costs were wholly disproportionate.  The Appellant&#8217;s costs were &#163;103,000, whereas the Respondent&#8217;s were &#163;36,000.  She gave herself a <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Lucas</span> direction.  She then noted what I have been told were approximately twenty five inconsistencies in the Appellant&#8217;s evidence.  She made many findings of fact against him and drew various adverse inferences.  She noted that there had been no sworn evidence from Joan Zhou, Human Resource Director at the Appellant&#8217;s employers.  The Respondent had challenged her evidence on the basis that the Appellant is her boss.   The judge noted that there had, eventually, been a letter from a doctor as to the Appellant&#8217;s myocardial ischaemia.  She found that there was no risk of redundancy if he had not reduced his hours and that his commitment to K did not prevent him working full-time.  She was not satisfied that he was working part-time but, if she was wrong about that, he was not maximising his earning capacity.  She therefore found there was no change in his income.  There was, however, a small reduction downwards in the maintenance as the Respondent&#8217;s income had risen modestly.  She ended her judgment by noting that the last thing needed was further litigation.  Very regrettably, the opposite has occurred.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 15 October 2021, the judge decided to make a costs order against the Appellant.  Her final order is dated 6 December 2021.  The variation, as noted above, reduced the immediate periodical payments to &#163;2,185 per month until the end of K&#8217;s Year 2.  The payments would then be &#163;2,076 per month until 15 November 2029 and then &#163;2,400 per month until K commences Year 7 and then &#163;1,900 per month.  Arrears of &#163;15,638 were to be payable at &#163;1,500 per month from 15 November 2021 to 15 October 2023.  It follows that the Appellant&#8217;s monthly total payments were to be &#163;3,685 per month.   The Appellant did not seek permission to appeal this order at the time.  </p>

She stayed the Respondent&#8217;s enforcement application on the basis of the further application to vary.  The second was before Judge Gibbons on 30 May 2022.  She set the application down for hearing in September 2022 with a two day hearing.  A recital to her order said that the sole ground for a variation is the birth of X and whether that provides sufficient basis to vary.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Nevertheless, in a statement dated 25 July 2022, the Appellant raised a whole series of additional points.  He said his income had reduced, although he accepted his monthly salary had not changed since January 2021.  He asserted that the Respondent&#8217;s position had improved due to a further increase in his income; an inheritance from his mother; and a reduction in his outgoings. The Appellant asserted he could not afford the maintenance ordered due to the costs and arrears burden.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">He finally provided a statement from Joan Zhou on 23 August 2022.  I have read the statement provisionally.  It confirms that the Appellant is a part-time employee and gives his salary in HK$ and CNY.  I have to say that I cannot understand why this statement was so late, given the specific reference in HHJ Gibbons&#8217; judgment to the absence of such confirmation.  Mr Calhaem argues that it was only in a statement from the Respondent dated 11 August 2022 that the Appellant realised that the Respondent was challenging his income but I cannot accept that as it is clear that the Respondent has challenged the Appellant&#8217;s income throughout.  It may, in fact, have been more to do with the recital to the order of HHJ Gibbons dated 30 May 2022 that the only issue was the birth of X.  </p>

The variation application was dismissed.   By then, the Appellant had incurred further costs of &#163;32,448 and the Respondent costs of &#163;33,734.  The Respondent&#8217;s enforcement application was withdrawn on the basis that the Appellant pays arrears of &#163;13,695 at &#163;1,500 per month from 15 September 2024 until 15 May 2025.  He was to pay the Respondent&#8217;s costs of the variation application in the sum of &#163;23,994, which were to be payable at &#163;1,500 per month from 15 June 2025.</p>

He makes the point that the Appellant has spent &#163;135,448 on the two applications, which amounts to approximately five years&#8217; maintenance.  The judge notes that the Appellant&#8217;s case is that he should pay nominal periodical payments for K, but will pay &#163;1,500 per month towards the arrears and, from 1 November 2023, he will pay &#163;345 per month, which he says is the CMS calculation for his maintenance for K.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Judge then, inevitably, raises the issues of principle, namely to what extent the Appellant can relitigate the issues that were fully and carefully resolved last year.  He asks whether reissuing the application  based on largely the same arguments amounts, rather than to appeal, to an abuse of process.   He notes that the argument before Judge Gibbons was that the Appellant&#8217;s income had reduced from &#163;9,866 per month to &#163;6,030 per month and then &#163;4,011 per month. The Appellant had said then that he was only working part-time and he had relied on ill-health. The Recorder quotes extensively from the judgment of HHJ Gibbons and makes the point that these were findings of fact, which were not appealed.  He refers to the recital to HHJ Gibbons&#8217; order of 30 May 2022 and notes that, if the application had been articulated more broadly, it would likely have faced an application to strike out on the basis that it was an abuse of process. </p>

He notes that the Appellant was saying his income was now &#163;4,300 per month due to changes in exchange rates.  The Appellant accepted that his employers have done well, increasing sales by 15% and profits by 500%.  He said that he was working part-time for the foreseeable future because he needed to help his partner, who does not work, with their new baby.  I note that he did not say that this was due to ill-health or his employers being unable to offer him full-time work.  He said he did not want to rent out his apartment in Canada Water as he might need it for future contact with K.  He asserted a legal obligation to support his parents to the tune of &#163;500 per month.  The Recorder found certain of his answers lacked credibility.  He was not impressed by the Appellant&#8217;s evidence for not returning to work.  He clearly did not accept that it was reasonable for one parent to work only three days per week when the other parent was not working.  He was also not impressed by his explanation for not renting out his London apartment.  </p>

Through absolutely no fault of his own, he has been put through two years of contentious and, at times, wholly unmeritorious litigation.  The Appellant agreed an order and then reneged almost immediately, leading to the expensive round of litigation that ended with HHJ Gibbons&#8217; judgment.  Rather than appeal, the Appellant applied back for a further variation virtually immediately.  He then agreed a recital to the May 2022 order of HHJ Gibbons that he was only relying on the birth of his new child in relation to the second variation application but he then reneged on that as well.  He has spent over &#163;130,000 on this litigation, which is the equivalent of five years&#8217; maintenance.  Regardless of the outcome of this appeal, I am clear that all these points will be relevant to the question of the costs of the appeal and the costs below.</p>

The Respondent, therefore, says, with some force, that the Appellant is bound by the findings of fact of HHJ Gibbons.  Moreover, he argues that the Appellant cannot challenge those findings before me as he has been refused permission to appeal out of time against that order by Morgan J. </p>

On that basis, I accept that the combined periodical payments and arrears/costs amount to around 85% of his income.  I recognise that there is an un-appealed finding, based on evidence taken in June 2021, that his income was, at that point, &#163;9,866 per month net.  It is now two years since then.  I have to ask myself for how long it is right for a court, which must act justly, to hold him to that figure due to what is, effectively, his litigation misconduct in bringing the matter back to court rather than appeal.</p>

If his income was still &#163;9,866 per month net, all these documents would have to be fraudulent, presumably, on the basis that the additional salary is paid into an undisclosed account.  Whilst a court can, and in this case did, make adverse inferences, they must be proper ones to make on the evidence.    I do not consider such findings now would be safe.  This is not, of course, the end of the matter.  There are two particular aspects that I will return to later in this judgment, namely his part-time work and the flat in Canada Water. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I also make it clear that I have come to this conclusion with a very heavy heart.  I have enormous sympathy for Recorder Chandler KC.  He was faced with an application that he found, for reasons that I entirely understand, to be an abuse of process, given that it was made so shortly after the un-appealed judgment of HHJ Gibbons.  Moreover, the Appellant had nailed his colours to the mast by accepting a recital that he was only relying on the birth of the child as a change of circumstances.  I fear this was done simply to avoid a strike out application.  Having said all that, Recorder Chandler KC did not strike the application out.  He proceeded to determine it, albeit on the basis of the light touch approach that he was undoubtedly entitled to take.  He heard oral evidence.  I have come to the conclusion that, having done so, he did have to find Appellant&#8217;s income was as he said it was, in the absence of making findings that the Appellant and his employers had deliberately concocted payslips and contracts to pervert the course of justice.  He did not make such findings so I find it impossible to see how I can fail to allow the appeal on Ground 1, even though I can entirely understand why the Recorder came to the conclusion that he did.</p>

By the narrowest of margins, I have decided not to do so.  The court has to consider all the circumstances of the case when conducting the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> exercise.

In this case, I do not understand why it is said by Mr Calhaem that there cannot be any element of spousal support.  The Respondent&#8217;s earning capacity is constrained by the fact that he is the primary carer of K.  Mr Calhaem makes much of the fact that the CMS figure, on the basis of his client having an income of &#163;4,300 per month and, I believe, contact six days out of fourteen, is only &#163;345 per month.  It is quite clear to me that this would be inadequate maintenance in the circumstances of this case, if the Appellant was living in this jurisdiction and therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the CMS.  It must, therefore, follow that there is a substantial ingredient of spousal support.  After all, the parties agreed a far higher figure of &#163;2,900 per month only three years ago.  Moreover, the order was to decrease as K got older, presumably, on the basis that the Respondent will be able to increase his earnings by then.  In any event, this is what the parties agreed and it would be quite wrong to discharge the nominal periodical payments order in the light of that agreement.</p>
