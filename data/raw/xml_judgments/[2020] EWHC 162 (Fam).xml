	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">This case, which concerns two teenagers of Spanish parents and nationality, is no stranger to this court or to the family courts in Spain. As will be seen these young people have been the subjects of litigation for many years. The elder child (AB) a girl, is now sixteen years old; in less than two years she will have reached her majority. As it is domestic jurisdiction in respect of arrangements for AB is now limited, once an adult this court will not have any jurisdiction, it will be her decision where she lives. Her younger brother (BC) will shortly be thirteen, and while he is still an adolescent, he was born in England and has, in actuality, lived here most of his life. Both AB and BC are separately represented through their court appointed guardian, Ms Jaqueline Roddy, and have had their case presented by counsel, instructed by Cafcass Legal. Their mother, who is a cardiologist, works for the NHS in the South of England where the children live and attend school, who appeared in person as she is not entitled to publicly funded representation. Their father, who lives on the Spanish mainland, is in receipt of public funding and is represented by solicitors and counsel. During the currency of the proceedings in this jurisdiction the children have repeatedly told their guardian, and, through her, this Court, that they want to continue to live with their mother and to remain in England. The Spanish Court has ordered that they live with their father in Spain.</p>

The proceedings in Spain continued during which the children were seen by a Spanish judge. The Spanish Court ordered a transfer of residence to Spain in June 2016 and for the children to live with their father; they had never lived with him after their parents separated. Pursuant to an order of the Spanish Court in Tenerife 2013, where the children were then habitually resident, they moved to live with their mother in England in December 2013. They have lived here since, attending their respective schools and are, as evidenced by their guardian&#8217;s written analysis and oral evidence, well integrated into their social and peer groups.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">These protracted proceedings have involved the family courts of both the Spanish and English &amp; Welsh jurisdictions. I have attempted to set out the details of both sets of proceedings below. Putting the case briefly, proceedings concerning these children commenced in Spain in 2013 and at the end of 2013 the children moved to the UK where they have remained. As I have already observed these two young people have repeatedly, and over a period of years told their independent guardian that they do not want to be sent to Spain to live with their father but wish to remain in England living with their mother. </p>

The children&#8217;s parents married in 2002, in Barcelona, Spain. AB was born, in Spain, in October 2003. In 2004 the family moved to another city in Spain where the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent father (F) lives and works. In 2006, when AB was still </p>

There they remained until July 2011 when they all briefly moved back to the city of P where F currently lives for a few weeks, before moving to the Canarias. Within a year, in July 2012, F left the family home and moved back to the city of P where he remains. M and children stayed in Tenerife.  </p>

Further directions made included for F&#8217;s application for recognition and enforcement to be stayed; and for AB to be joined as a party (to be represented by an officer of the Cafcass High Court team as AB&#8217;s guardian) and that the allocated Cafcass officer should interview BC to ascertain BC&#8217;s wishes and feelings and to assess whether BC should also be joined to proceedings (to be represented by a guardian); and for the matter to be listed for a further hearing on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2017. </p>

In this judgment I shall make no attempt at a lengthy exposition nor comprehensive analysis of the law, nor is my judgment intended, in any sense, to stand counter to the previous judgments of the Court referred to above. This judgement is made on the facts before it in respect of these particular young people. The principle fact is this; on any objective and neutral analysis both children are habitually resident in England. They have lived here since 2013, are settled here and fully integrated into their school and education as well as in their peer group and social environment; there is no evidence before this Court which could be said to amount to anything of substance contrary to such a finding. Wherever the proceedings concerning them both commenced or was initiated they have been living with their mother in England for an uninterrupted period exceeding six years. They have never been in their father&#8217;s sole care nor has he ever cared for them alone for any substantial period of time. </p>

Their guardian, as she said, had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;met the children a number of times and listened carefully to their views&#8221;</span> enabling Ms Roddy, as she said at paragraph 41<span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;to have the wider benefit of considering the likely harm and loss to the children were they to be forced to go and live in Spain against their clearly and strongly expressed wishes&#8221;</span>. </p>

The guardian considered that this was influenced by M and urged AB to leave the required safeguards to the adults and the court, but I consider it is more likely than not likely that AB&#8217;s position has also been influenced by the recent actions taken by F to enforce the Spanish Court orders and her experience in respect of contact in the past when F removed the children to Thailand and Indonesia. Nor do I agree that AB demonstrated a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;conflicted position&#8221;,</span> as described by the guardian, by her indicating she does not wish to see her father at all but then saying she wished to attend the wedding of her paternal aunt in Spain as these are two separate events involving different members of her family.  </p>

Their need to maintain and build on their relationship with F is influenced by his unwillingness to listen to their, repeatedly expressed, views, wishes and feelings.  In order to spend time with him, especially in Spain, they need to know they can rely on him, safe and secure in the knowledge that he will ensure they can return home (their home as they see it is England) and neither they nor their mother would be subject to legal action in Spain. While M may have failed to promote the children&#8217;s relationship with their father her actions have not taken place in isolation. The failure of the parties to work together is a reflection, at least in part, of the conflict that is apparent in this case between the two jurisdictions.  </p>

In any case this would have amounted to no more than a postponement of the ultimate decision. The limited defence in Art 23 (a) does not apply to BC; but, while F, at least, seeks the immediate return of BC, allowing AB to remain in England for some months, their guardian strenuously opposed any separation of the brother from his sister and gave good reasons for doing so.</p>

As their counsel observed, whatever each parent&#8217;s respective arguments, the Spanish proceedings have taken a significant period of time to be resolved during which the children have grown, remained living in England and attained greater maturity. As already observed above in this judgment, on any objective and neutral basis AB and BC are habitually resident in England; moreover, having previously lived in England between 2006 and July 2011, on their return to England in December 2013 and to date they have lived in England for over a decade since 2006. As evidenced by the guardian&#8217;s analysis, they are settled and fully integrated into their locality, their peer group, their schools and their home life with their mother (who has been their principle carer giver throughout their lives) in England. In addition to which, on the evidence before this court, both AB and BC have consistently and strongly expressed their wish to live with their mother and remain in England. It was a Spanish court that permitted them to return to England in the first place. </p>
