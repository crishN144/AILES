Sub-tests and technicality of all sorts should be avoided. In particular, the Re T approach to the gateway stage should be abandoned.&#8217;</span></p>

The factors do not revolve only around the child's objections, as is apparent. The court has to have regard to other welfare considerations, in so far as it is possible to take a view about them on the limited evidence that will be available as part of the summary proceedings. And importantly, it must give weight to the Hague Convention considerations. It must at all times be borne in mind that the Hague Convention only works if, in general, children who have been wrongfully retained or removed from their country of habitual residence are returned and returned promptly. To reiterate what Baroness Hale said at &#167;42 of Re M, "[t]he message must go out to potential abductors that there are no safe havens among contracting states".&#160;&#160;</span></p>

She alleges the father was very controlling, eventually stopping her having any contact with her family.  She describes occasions when the father locked her out of the family home. The police were called on a number of occasions but the mother did not feel she could press charges.  In 2012, she describes an occasion when the father tried to strangle her and threatened to kill her.  She also alleges he was also sexually violent to her and raped her.</p>

He attacked her with a knife and she fled from the house, taking the children with her.  The mother called the police who arrested the father.  She and the children went to a women&#8217;s refuge in Ireland, but the father found out her location and began following and harassing her. In early July 2014 the mother obtained a barring order, but this did not prevent the father from continuing this behaviour. The details are set out in the letter from the refuge in Ireland. The mother left for the UK with the children on 21 July 2014 to escape from the father. She is currently living in a refuge with the children.</p>

He had contacted the Child Abduction Investigation Unit and issued an application for summary return under the Hague Convention on 27 November.  Location orders were made by Parker J. At around the same time the mother applied to the Family Court at Staines for a prohibited steps and child arrangements order, along with a non-molestation order.  The court ordered that mother&#8217;s address should remain confidential, gave permission for the statements filed in those applications to be served on the Child Abduction Investigation Unit and &#8220;the relevant court dealing with any issues in respect of the children in Ireland&#8221; and listed the matter for hearing on 22 December 2014.  Those proceedings have now been stayed in the light of the father&#8217;s application under the Hague Convention.</p>

His behaviour is becoming increasingly difficult, in particular to his mother. He appears to have less difficulty at school.  A referral for D has been made to CAMHS due to his anger, aggressive behaviour and self-harming. He was assessed by them in early September and I was informed by Ms Thain that he has just started play therapy, he is on a programme for 9 weekly sessions and the expectation is that he will need more.</p>

She said she had raised with him the prospect of going back with his mother but he considered he was still not safe. It was suggested to her that effectively D was not objecting to the return to Ireland it was the father he was objecting to, she disagreed and said in D&#8217;s mind he doesn&#8217;t want to go back to Ireland, it was where he was living with his father and he didn&#8217;t feel safe. She said D equated going back to Ireland with an unsafe situation. She agreed she did not discuss the option of going into foster care with D as that was not really being put forward as an option. She agreed she did not specifically explore with D the option of returning to Ireland and not seeing his father. She said when she tried to explore safe ways of returning to Ireland, such as with his mother, she observed him become very frightened. She said her impression was D equated returning to Ireland as being unsafe and frightening place where his father was. She agreed D was not a very mature boy but did not consider his responses to be unusual bearing in mind his experiences. </p>

Mr Jones his counsel viewed what had been filmed and observed the father delete the film. In court Mr Jones apologised on behalf of the father for this behaviour. The explanation put forward on the father&#8217;s behalf was that he wanted to film the court building to show his mother when he returned to Ireland. There was obviously not a full investigation of this incident and I did not hear the father give oral evidence about it. This incident plays no part in my decision but it does raise the question, if the father&#8217;s explanation is correct, as to why if he wanted to film the building to show his mother he happened to choose a narrow internal court corridor which included footage of the mother.</p>

In my judgment D objects to being returned to Ireland and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his views. He is 9 years old and whilst there is some evidence that his understanding is lower than his chronological age, Ms Brooks in her assessment considered his objections were founded on his actual experience and reflected his belief that he would not be safe in Ireland. She felt these views were genuine and were congruent with his behaviour which she observed when they met. They were based on first hand experience, rather than the product of any undue influence by others. I agree with this assessment which is supported by the interview she had and the other material that was available to her. The fears expressed by D were genuine and strongly held. Whilst it is correct it was difficult for D to separate his objections to a return to Ireland from a return to particular circumstances involving his father his objection to a return to Ireland due to his fears for his own safety remained. This was clear when Ms Brooks raised with him a return with his mother, which did not allay his fears.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The availability of protective measures in this case may not, on the facts of this case be effective. The mother and children had fled the family home in Ireland after an alleged assault on her by the father. After calling the police she and the children had been placed in a refuge. There is no dispute that the father made contact with the mother, although there is an issue as to the precise circumstances. The mother obtained a barring order, which is in similar terms as a non molestation injunction here. It was following the father allegedly breaching the terms of that order the mother made the decision to come to this country with the children. Therefore the mother and D have direct experience of orders being made to protect them not being effective in Ireland. This has to be viewed in the context of the father still wishing the family to be reunited. This was made clear in the submissions made to this court; that is his first position. The protective measures proposed are unlikely to address the fears expressed by the mother or D.</p>

Mr Jones rightly says that would cause the father difficulties. However he did make it clear if the children remain here the father would participate in the proceedings here that are currently stayed. The reality is that issue is more likely to be determined here in a more timely way, the proceedings are already before the court and the necessary work and support for the children is already in place. If they returned to Ireland fresh court proceedings would be required and there would be inevitable disruption in the therapeutic support being available.

His objection to being sent back to Ireland is founded on the violence he reports he suffered from his father, and he genuinely believes he would not be safe. I accept Ms Brooks&#8217; assessment as to the genuineness of his views and those fears. He has had direct experience of protective measures in Ireland not working. His emotional state is particularly concerning and it is clearly important that he continues to receive the support he is currently receiving, with as little disruption as possible. It is right to carefully consider his age and level of maturity and what is said about his level of understanding, but it is clear in the way he expressed himself to Ms Brooks he had a rational base for his views. It was noteworthy that he expressed considerable anxiety when he thought details of his current school might be disclosed to his father and his fears did not reduce when he was asked to consider a return to Ireland with his mother.</p>

This is not, in my judgment, one of those cases where the mother is taking a position to influence the outcome of the case. The rationale for her position is based on her own experience of protective measures in Ireland previously being insufficient to protect her and the children from harm. Her mental and emotional fragility is evident from the information provided by the refuge. A return to Ireland is likely to have real risks to her emotional stability.</p>
