The story seems to have broken in the United Kingdom on Sunday 19 April 2015 and was extensively reported in the United Kingdom media. The family had apparently left home, without warning and without telling the wider family, on 7 April 2015. They were caught on CCTV going through customs at the Port of Dover at about midnight the same day, leaving the United Kingdom on a ferry that departed very early next morning. Some days later (in fact on 16 April 2015) they were reported missing to the Police. On 19 April 2015 the Police appealed for information about their whereabouts. The acting Deputy Chief Constable of the Thames Valley Police was quoted in media reports as voicing concern that the family might be travelling to Syria, though &#8220;not suggesting for one moment that they are intending to join Islamic State.&#8221; The same day, as it subsequently transpired, the family crossed the border into Turkey. They were detained by the Turkish authorities in Ankara on 20 April 2015, a fact reported in the United Kingdom media later the same day.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Behind the scenes there had been extensive collaboration between the local authority, Slough Borough Council, the Police and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). Proceedings were drafted on Monday 4 May 2015. Early the following morning, at about 5.40am on Tuesday 5 May 2015, the decision was taken by the local authority to make an ex parte (without notice) application later that morning. At about 7.00am the local authority was informed by the FCO that it would be &#8220;pointless&#8221; if an order was not obtained by 11.00am. At about 7.30am, Mr John Vater QC, on the instructions of the local authority, contacted the &#8216;out of hours&#8217; duty officer, saying that an urgent telephone hearing with the &#8216;out of hours&#8217; judge was required. The draft order and the unsworn affidavit of the solicitor acting for the local authority, Miss Sarah Castle, were emailed to the duty officer for onward transmission to Baker J, the &#8216;out of hours&#8217; judge. Exhibited to the unsworn affidavit were a statement of Detective Inspector Horsburgh dated 30 April 2015 and a briefing note dated 24 April 2015 produced by the Police for the purpose of family court proceedings. The telephone hearing before Baker J commenced at about 8.15am.</p>

In any event, that claim must be set against the fact that the family had travelled across Europe effectively on public transport, had told no-one of their holiday plans, and were heading towards the Turkish/Syrian border at the point of their arrest.</p>

It does seem to us that in view of the parents&#8217; obvious refusal to return to the UK, a proportionate response is to seek their urgent cooperation with an assessment in order that their plans for the children may be clearer to us, and about which reasoned decisions may be taken. Social workers were on their way to Turkey for that purpose; we are now looking into diverting them to Moldova.

Time was plainly of the essence, for the flight to Moldova was due to land in a little over one hour&#8217;s time. The Press Association&#8217;s reporter, Mr Brian Farmer, was present, as he was entitled to be, even though I was sitting in private. For reasons which are obvious, and to which I shall return below, it was important that there should be, at least for the time being, no reporting either of the fact that there were now court proceedings on foot or of the terms of any order I might make. On the other hand, this was absolutely no reason for excluding Mr Farmer from the hearing (not that this was something sought by Mr Vater). On the contrary, if there was any question of my making a reporting restriction order of the kind I had in mind that was a very powerful reason for <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>excluding the media&#8217;s representative. I thought it important that Mr Farmer should be permitted to remain in court. But at the beginning of the hearing, and without any objection from Mr Farmer, I made an order that there was to be no reporting of the hearing. I said:</p>

The children, on the evidence, are British subjects and are therefore amenable to the wardship jurisdiction wherever they may be, and so the fact that they are no longer in the jurisdiction is neither here nor there.  </p>

Because of the need to get the family onto the flights, those Orders need to be made (according to the Consul) by about 10.30 at the latest. In those circumstances I felt it necessary to ask if you would deal with the matter by email. In the event that, for unforeseeable reasons, that Order cannot be made in time, I have taken the view that the Consul should simply hand the passports to the social workers for them to hold for the time being, and I will apply for a retrospective variation. I have said so for pragmatic reasons which intend no disrespect to the Court. It is obviously important in these circumstances that the family returns by agreement.</p>

There is always, every minute of every day and night throughout the year, a judge of the Family Division on duty, &#8216;out of hours&#8217;, to deal with cases so urgent that they cannot wait. This case, I believe, shows the system working well. The court became involved in the early morning of Tuesday 5 May.

The Republic is a sovereign state within which, of course, I have no authority at all. The English court must always be astute to ensure that no order it makes could possibly be construed as an interference with the sovereign rights of another State. These are matters to be dealt with in accordance with the well-established principles of international comity between friendly States. That is why the order I made was deliberately expressed in terms of this court &#8220;respectfully requesting&#8221; the assistance of the various public authorities in Moldova to which I referred.

This is not the occasion, and there is no need for me, to explore the range of circumstances in which it may be appropriate to make a child who is outside the jurisdiction a ward of court. I merely observe that cases such as this demonstrate the continuing need for a remedy which, despite its antiquity, has shown, is showing and must continue to show a remarkable adaptability to meet the ever emerging needs of an ever changing world. I add that the use of the jurisdiction in cases where the risk to a child is of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention &#8211; risk to life or risk of degrading or inhuman treatment &#8211; is surely unproblematic. So wardship is surely an appropriate remedy, even if the child has already left the jurisdiction, in cases where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad for the purposes of a forced marriage (as in <span style="font-style:italic">Re KR </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span>) or so that she can be subjected to female genital mutilation or (as here) where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad to travel to a dangerous war-zone. There is no need for me to go any further, so I need not consider whether there are other kinds of situation where a child who is already abroad should be made a ward of court or whether wardship is an appropriate remedy where the risk to the child is of harm falling short of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention.</p>

Such an order contains what can be characterised as the super-injunction element. Examples of such orders in the context of civil proceedings are, for instance, search orders &#8230; and freezing injunctions. In such cases, temporary secrecy is essential in order to ensure that alleged wrongdoers are not tipped-off to the order&#8217;s existence, which would then enable them to frustrate its primary purpose. As Lord Judge CJ put it, where, for instance, &#8216;a defendant is committing fraud, and you believe that he has a number of associates, an order preventing him from reporting the fact that an injunction (that is to say a freezing injunction) [is] issued against him . . . because without it, he would be able to inform his dishonest colleagues, and they would immediately take steps to hide away assets.

Temporary secrecy via non-disclosure of the fact of proceedings and the order is thus an essential feature of the proper administration of justice in such cases.&#8221;</p>

Thus orders can be made against public authorities &#8230; requiring them to search their records with a view to informing the court whether they have any record of the child or the child&#8217;s parent or other carer. Similar orders can be directed to telephone and other IT service providers, to banks and other financial institutions, to airline and other travel service providers &#8230; and to relatives, friends and associates of the abducting parent &#8230; </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[37] <marker name="tab"/>Since, for obvious reasons, it is important that the abducting parent is neither alerted to the investigations being carried out by the court nor informed of the identities of those from whom information is being sought nor informed of their answers, such orders are almost invariably made, and oral evidence taken, at hearings held in private from which the abducting parent&#8217;s representatives are excluded and of which, typically, they will be wholly unaware, the applications being made ex parte and without notice. Moreover, and for the same reason, the orders themselves typically provide that they are not to be served on the abducting parent, just as they typically forbid those to whom the order is directed from informing the abducting parent of the existence of the order. Accordingly, and for reasons which in the nature of things are compelling, this small, discrete and necessarily discreet part of the Family Division&#8217;s jurisdiction is, in distinction to the vast bulk of the Division&#8217;s work, carried on not merely in private but typically in secret. The justification is that explained by Sir John Donaldson MR in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies ex parte New Cross Building Society</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1984] QB 227" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1984">[1984] QB 227</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1984] 2 WLR 370" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1984">[1984] 2 WLR 370</ref> at 235 and 376 respectively, namely that unless it adopts this particular procedure in this particular type of case the court will be unable to achieve its paramount object of doing justice according to law; for abjuring secrecy in such circumstances is likely to lead, directly or indirectly, to a denial of justice and, not least, justice for the innocent child.&#8221;</p>
