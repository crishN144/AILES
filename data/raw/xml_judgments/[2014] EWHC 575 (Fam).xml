The application is made pursuant to the Inherent Jurisdiction following the respondent mother&#8217;s retention of L in this jurisdiction in October 2013, after an agreed holiday. The mother objects to L&#8217;s return.</p>

As a consequence this judgment was delayed overnight.</p>

She is employed by a Bermudian Insurance Company called R R as an executive assistant. Although based in Bermuda they have offices in London where she has from time to time come and worked for short periods of time. She has been employed with them since 2010. She has been signed off work since the end of September 2013, first by the GP in Bermuda and more recently by the GP here. The medical certificate initially records the basis as being severe stress and more recently depression. She is signed off until 25 April 2014. </p>

The mother wishes to take this up, as she sees that as the only way she can maintain her earning position. She had requested part time work before in Bermuda in 2012 but that had been turned down, although she has not asked recently. She suffers from a painful arthritic condition that is exacerbated by her desk related job.</p>

In his short affidavit filed in support of this application in Bermuda the father seeks the full time care of L, but gives no practical details as to how he would manage that. It remains unclear how long the hearing is listed for on 3 April.  </p>

The Supreme Court considered the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;crucial factor&#8217;</span> in that case was that the child concerned was a Texan child who was being denied a proper opportunity to develop a relationship with his father and with his country of birth. This was against a background where the mother had been unenthusiastic about contact between the child and his father. The court concluded that the best chance the child had of developing a proper relationship with both his parents, and with the country whose nationality he holds, was for the Texas court to consider where his best interests lie in the long term. There were no issues on the facts of that case that the child would suffer any significant harm by returning to Texas on the basis proposed by the father.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.58in">A matter that has weighed heavily in my balancing exercise is the adverse impact <marker name="tab"/>that not ordering L&#8217;s return to Bermuda will have on his relationship with his father <marker name="tab"/>and his father&#8217;s ability to be able to fairly participate in any proceedings in this <marker name="tab"/>jurisdiction.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.58in">Whilst I fully recognise the evidence has not been tested, it is apparent from the <marker name="tab"/>information I have read that the mother is in a fragile emotional state. She has <marker name="tab"/>been signed off work since the end of September, initially for severe stress and <marker name="tab"/>more recently for depression. The father accepts the mother is depressed but <marker name="tab"/>states that the medical support she had prior to leaving Bermuda is still available <marker name="tab"/>and she will be returning to a different situation, as she will not be living with <marker name="tab"/>the father. The mother states that her best chance of recovery, in the short and <marker name="tab"/>long term, is to remain in this jurisdiction, with the support of her family and <marker name="tab"/>hopefully return to part time work with her current employers. This is supported <marker name="tab"/>in <marker name="tab"/>part by the letters from the GP. The most recent one dated 31 January 2014 <marker name="tab"/>states <marker name="tab"/>the GP has had 5 consultations with her since 9 October 2013 where he has provided <marker name="tab"/>support and medication (anti depressants and sleeping tablets). Despite that <marker name="tab"/>medication and support he describes her as experiencing fluctuating levels of anxiety <marker name="tab"/>and depression characterised by insomnia, rumination on the possible outcomes of <marker name="tab"/>various forms of action and bouts of tearfulness and she has found the stress of <marker name="tab"/>dealing with ongoing proceedings difficult to manage. The concern expressed about <marker name="tab"/>the impact on her mental health of a return to Bermuda is prefaced on the basis that <marker name="tab"/>she would be entering back into a situation from which she fled where she was <marker name="tab"/>isolated. Mr Devereux submits the <marker name="tab"/>court should place limited weight on these letters <marker name="tab"/>from the GP as they are untested, were not sought on joint instructions, are tainted by <marker name="tab"/>being reliant on self assertion, inconsistent in content as to whether the mother has <marker name="tab"/>depression, paint a somewhat dramatic picture, relies upon a report from Dr R that <marker name="tab"/>the court has not seen and only gives a possibility of a risk of deterioration if <marker name="tab"/>the mother <marker name="tab"/>returns to Bermuda. Whilst I, of course, factor in that the GPs opinion <marker name="tab"/>has not been tested in oral evidence it is clear on the face of the written material I <marker name="tab"/>have that a return to Bermuda, even if the mother is living separately from the father, <marker name="tab"/>is likely to be stressful for her. She has limited or no social support in Bermuda, her <marker name="tab"/>living situation will be very uncertain and there is a risk her psychological position <marker name="tab"/>may deteriorate. This could have an adverse effect on L&#8217;s welfare as she is in reality <marker name="tab"/>his main carer. Whilst I recognise there is an issue between the parties as to the <marker name="tab"/>extent to which they had the care of L in the past, it is not disputed that even though <marker name="tab"/>the father has not been working L was with a full time carer or in nursery from the <marker name="tab"/>age of four months old and has not been <marker name="tab"/>in the sole care of the father overnight or <marker name="tab"/>for any extended periods of time. It is clearly in L&#8217;s interests that his mother makes a <marker name="tab"/>full recovery as soon as possible and on the information I have that is more likely to <marker name="tab"/>take place if she lives here with the family and other support that is immediately <marker name="tab"/>available to her. It is also most likely to be the environment where she will be able to <marker name="tab"/>return to work and be<marker name="tab"/>financially independent in the long term.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.58in">Another factor is if the mother returned to Bermuda with L it would be to a <marker name="tab"/>relatively precarious financial situation. The father does not work and does not <marker name="tab"/>have any significant assets, he accepts as much in the document attached to his <marker name="tab"/>own statement where he describes his earnings and savings as nil/negligible. <marker name="tab"/>The mother is unlikely to be in a fit state to work if she returns to Bermuda and <marker name="tab"/>there is a real question mark as to whether any suitable part time work would be <marker name="tab"/>available for her. There was an issue regarding her immigration status and her <marker name="tab"/>ability to work in Bermuda following the filing of the divorce petition but that <marker name="tab"/>issue is now clear that if she was medically able to she would be able to work. <marker name="tab"/>The father submits that he has offered sufficient undertakings to tide the position <marker name="tab"/>over until there can be a hearing in the courts in Bermuda, although there is no <marker name="tab"/>information as to when a hearing could take place to deal with finances. He has <marker name="tab"/>offered to pay $500 per week towards suitable <marker name="tab"/>accommodation, to pay L&#8217;s nursery <marker name="tab"/>fees, $150 per week support for L and to cover the cost of <marker name="tab"/>any medical insurance. <marker name="tab"/>During the hearing he gave instructions to Mr Devereux that he would be willing to <marker name="tab"/>deposit $5,200 as a condition of L&#8217;s return, which was the equivalent of 2 months of <marker name="tab"/>the payments he was proposing up front, to give additional security. The father relies <marker name="tab"/>on the mother&#8217;s financial resources which consist of savings of &#163;54,000 here <marker name="tab"/>(&#163;40,000 of which she says are earmarked for L), $8,000 in Bermuda and the <marker name="tab"/>&#163;22,000 she paid to her parents as being, in reality, still available. This is in addition <marker name="tab"/>to rental income she could obtain from her property here. Whilst these resources <marker name="tab"/>would be available to help provide for the immediate financial needs they need to be <marker name="tab"/>factored in with the other considerations <marker name="tab"/>and that they are <marker name="tab"/>very likely to rapidly run <marker name="tab"/>out if the parties are unable to reach agreement, or there is any significant delay in <marker name="tab"/>court proceedings. The mother estimates her monthly expenses if she returns to <marker name="tab"/>Bermuda to be in the region of &#163;5,000 per month, ignoring any legal costs for <marker name="tab"/>contested proceedings in Bermuda, which she estimates are likely to cost in the <marker name="tab"/>region of $80,000.</p>

However, it appears from the papers that her parents, in particular her <marker name="tab"/>mother, has been able to regularly spend time with her in Bermuda to provide <marker name="tab"/>support. There is nothing to suggest that support would not be available in the <marker name="tab"/>future until the parties have either reached agreement or the court in Bermuda <marker name="tab"/>has made an order. In <marker name="tab"/>addition, there is no evidence to suggest the medical and <marker name="tab"/>psychological support <marker name="tab"/>that was available to the mother would not be available <marker name="tab"/>again.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in">Drawing these considerations together I have reached the conclusion it is in L&#8217;s best interests that he should return with his mother to Bermuda so that welfare issues between the parties regarding L can be decided there. The factors that tip the welfare considerations in favour of such a course are the adverse impact on L&#8217;s relationship with his father if he does not return to Bermuda; the mother will be returning to a situation that is different from the one she left in that the parties will be living separately, which is likely to reduce the stress a return will cause on her; she would be able to take up the medical and other support that was available to her before and is known to her; her parents are likely to be able to come and support her during this period; L is a child who was born and brought up in Bermuda. To date Bermuda has been his main home. The courts in Bermuda are best placed to be able to determine the welfare issues between the parties and a hearing is listed in a relatively short period of time. I accept the mother&#8217;s decision to stay here did have an element of pre-planning, but that needs to be looked at in the context of her psychological state at the time. Her GP described her as being severely depressed when she saw her in September and she appears to have been at a very low point at that time.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in"> The undertakings offered by the father at paragraph 64 of his statement should form part of the order and should include division of the basic items of furniture in their current rented property to assist the mother and L in rented accommodation, which is likely to be unfurnished. In relation to the issue of financial support a condition of the mother&#8217;s return is that the father should make an immediate payment of $7,500 which would secure the financial arrangements he proposes for about 2 months. I have increased the sum he proposed by just over $2,000 as I consider on the information I have that a realistic rental for suitable accommodation for the mother and L is in the region of $3,000 per month, to ensure the property is in a suitable area and has sufficient space for the maternal grandmother to come and stay if she is able to. There will need to be provision for an ongoing weekly sum to be paid by the father after 2 months until either other arrangements are agreed in writing by the parties or an order is made in the Bermudan courts in relation to financial support. There will need to be an undertaking to cover the position regarding payment by the father of medical insurance (if required) and nursery fees.</p>

Continuing uncertainty is detrimental to his welfare and is very likely to delay the mother&#8217;s ability to fully recover and be in a position to return to work. What L needs is for his parents to reach agreement about his future care which realistically recognises the respective roles his parents have played and will play in his life following the breakdown of their relationship. I sincerely hope they will endeavour to do this for L&#8217;s sake and take up any suggestions of assistance to improve their communication with each other regarding L.</p>
