M was joined as a party to these proceedings by the order of HHJ Scarratt, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge on 11 October 2022.  He is today represented through his children's guardian.</p>

That application to commit was issued on 31 January 2023.  The mother is represented by Mr Basi of counsel.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother is an Iranian national who has been living in the United Kingdom since 2022 and holds dual Iranian and British citizenship.  Whilst the father was granted legal aid by the court at the outset of these contempt proceedings, the father has appeared unrepresented with the assistance of a McKenzie Friend, Mr Lennard.  At the outset of the hearing I gave Mr Lennard permission to advocate on behalf of the father, a task that Mr Lennard performed with conspicuous care and balance.  The father also holds dual Iranian and British citizenship.  He has lived in the United Kingdom for most of his life but has recently spent more time in Iran.  He has a number of aliases.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In determining this matter, the court has had the benefit of the evidence contained in the trial bundle that is before the court.  In support of her application the mother relied on the concessions by the father that (a) the children remain in the jurisdiction of Iran and have not yet been conveyed into the care of the maternal grandparents nor returned to the jurisdiction of England and Wales, and (b) the father has not provided a notarised document for the consensus of the children travelling from Iran to England, immediately the same was completed.  The mother further relies on the recitals in the previous orders made by the court recording the father's stated position that he will not comply with any orders of this court.  The father exercised his right to silence and Mr Lennard made submissions on his behalf.  I&#160;also heard submissions on behalf of M. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Dealing with the background of the matter, the mother and the father met through mutual friends in or around 2006.  They married under Sharia law in the UK on 28 July 2007 and had their civil marriage ceremony on 24 January 2008.  At that time the father used the name Srio Alimo Fernandez.  It was the father's case that he changed his name by deed poll afterwards to Ali Fakher.  M was born in the United Kingdom and is a dual British and Iranian citizen, as is E.  It is the mother's case that she and the father were jointly responsible for raising the children since their birth, that the father was critical of the fact that she was not a stay at home mother.  It is the father's case that he was solely responsible for the children's care before he left for Iran, and also since August 2021 when the children remained in Iran.  M has stated that both parents were present and looking after him and his sister when he was young.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother contends that she suffered emotional and psychological abuse from the father throughout the relationship and that he displayed controlling behaviour.  The father contends that there was no evidence of domestic abuse.  Both the mother and M allege that the father was violent to the children and would hit them.  The father asserts that such allegations are false.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2015, following the sad death of his mother, the father began spending more time in Iran.  In July 2021, the mother and the children travelled to Iran with return tickets to the United Kingdom for 24 August 2021.  It is the mother's case that she and the children travelled to visit the maternal grandparents.  By contrast the father asserts the purpose of the trip was to reignite the parents marriage.  During the time when the mother and the children were in Iran the father applied to register their marriage in that jurisdiction.  The mother contends that as a result she became worried about what would happen to her and the children if the father was successful in registering the marriage, and so decided to cut the trip short and book tickets to return to the United Kingdom on 3 August 2021.  The father alleges that the mother had in fact decided to abduct the children from Iran and to travel abroad with them without his knowledge and consent, which was contrary to Iranian law.</p>

	    <num>9</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, the mother alleges that when she and the children tried to leave Iran on 3 August 2021 they were told that the father had removed the permission for the children to leave the country.  By contrast the father alleges that because the children had arrived in Iran with Iranian passports, the Iranian authorities expected the father's consent before the children could leave Iran with British passports since dual citizenship was not recognised under Iranian law.  For reasons I will come to the question of the father's consent to the children leaving Iran has become a central feature of this case, featuring in a number of the orders that are now the subject of this committal application. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In the foregoing circumstances the mother alleges that as a result, and fearing that she would also be prohibited from leaving Iran, she left the children in the care of the maternal grandparents and returned to the United Kingdom to seek the children's return from this jurisdiction.  It is the father's case that the mother abandoned the children by themselves in the airport in Tehran and boarded the flight instead of seeking the father's consent to the removal of the children from that jurisdiction, or to suspend her travel arrangements.  Put in this context the father asserts that he was unaware that the mother had purchased a one way return to the United Kingdom for 3 August 2021, and she made no attempt to seek the father's consent.  The father asserts the mother was caught by the authorities in Tehran trying to leave without his consent and that she boarded the aircraft leaving the children behind and thereby placing them at risk.  In these circumstances the father alleges that he had to take custody of the children by default.  The mother denies that she abandoned the children at Tehran Airport.</p>

It was the mother's case that she withdrew those proceedings after M contacted her and she became aware that the father had been notified of the proceedings.  Thereafter the mother contends that she tried to have the children returned to the United Kingdom by complying with a series of requests made by the father, including:</p>

The father travelled to the United Kingdom in August 2022 and had his documents, including his passport, seized by the tipstaff.  The father's travel documents have been held by the tipstaff since that date.  </p>

That application alleges that the mother misled Judd J at the without notice hearing on 22 July 2022.  In particular the father alleges that the mother made false statements to the court amounting to an interference with, or having a tendency to interfere with, or obstruct, the due administration of justice.  The father alleges that this constitutes a contempt of court within the meaning of Rule 37.3(3) and Rule 37.3(5)(a) of the Family Procedure Rules.</p>

The mother further contends that the children's dual citizenship has been known throughout the proceedings and has been considered by the relevant judges in making their orders.  The mother further asserts that the court was also aware throughout the proceedings that the mother had commenced proceedings in Iran, which she subsequently withdrew.

However, prior to the hearing before Newton J the father had submitted to Peele J on 16 September 2022 that the English court could not have jurisdiction to make orders in respect of the children.  Within this context the father prepared a bundle on the question of jurisdiction.  Within that bundle is an extract from the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office's website entitled, "Guidance: Iran: Child Abduction," dated 21 August 2020.  A copy also finds its way into the trial prepared for this hearing.  Within that guidance the following is stated:</p>

The application to commit alleges that the father has failed to comply with the terms of the order of Newton J.  The mother alleges that the father breached the order of Newton J dated 18 November 2022, requiring him to send a copy of a notarised document consenting to the children travelling from Iran to England, immediately the same had been completed in that this was not provided.  Following the hearing the mother alleges the father<span style="font-style:italic"> immediately</span> handed to the tipstaff his driving licence, even though he required it to obtain the notarised agreement for the children to travel, thereby disabling himself in being able to provide a notarised agreement as he had agreed to do in circumstances where he had, given the execution of a passport order, no means of identifying himself to the notary.</p>

The father concedes that the children were not conveyed to the maternal grandparents in Iran, nor were they returned to the United Kingdom on 5 December 2022, nor did they attend the final hearing on 8 and 9 December 2022.  Rather it is apparent that they remained with the paternal grandfather, which it is alleged is in breach of para.14 and 15 of the order of Newton J to transfer them to the maternal grandparents.  The mother contends that when she spoke to the paternal grandfather, he informed her that he had no intention of sending the children to the maternal grandparents because the father did not want him to and he believed that the mother had fabricated the order of Newton J.  The father contends that in line with the extract from the FCDO document, "Guidance: Iran: Child Abduction," dated 21 August 2020, the fact that a wife and children are bound to live and reside in the house determined by the husband, prevented him from complying with the order of Newton J.</p>

In the order of ICC Mullen, however, that order comprised part of a wider regime.  In order for the father to obtain notarised consent he was required to have a means of identifying himself to a relevant notary.  In the circumstances, the order of ICC Mullen also provided for the temporary release to the father's solicitor of the driving licence, on condition that the father's solicitors hold the driving licence and not release it to the father, and return it to the tipstaff by a set date.  Following the hearing in December ICC Judge Mullen also extended the passport order.

However, the father contended that the tagging order prevented him from complying with the order of ICC Judge Mullen in that the tagging company did not attend to provide a tag to him.  The father alleges that the tagging company did not attend at the time specified in the order of ICC Judge Mullen, namely 7.00 p.m. on 12 December 2022, or at any other time on 12 and 13 December 2022.  The father further alleges that when the tagging company did attend they attended during a medical emergency that required him to be conveyed to hospital ambulance, and that accordingly he was not able to secure his driving licence from the tipstaff and hence was not able to secure a notarised agreement.</p>

Moore J also again provided for the notarised agreement and included in that order permission for the maternal grandparents to obtain replacement Iranian passports for the children.  Moore J also made a further order for the imposition of tagging.  Whilst the order of Moore J on 16 December was not sealed until 20 December 2022, the father was again present in court when the order was made on 16 December 2022.

The matter has been listed in open court and I am satisfied that the father received proper notice of the hearing.</p>

Within that context the father does not seek to dispute either that he has failed to provide a notarised agreement or that the children remain in the jurisdiction of Iran.

With respect to the order of Newton J, the father contends in this regard that this order requires him to surrender his driving licence, which he did on the day of the hearing.  With respect to the subsequent orders of ICC Judge Mullen, Moor J and Mr Colton KC, the father contends that the wording of those orders regarding tagging and the failure on the part of the tagging company meant that he continued to be unable to retrieve his driving licence.

As I&#160;have noted, the father concedes however that he lodged his driving licence with the tipstaff immediately whilst in court on 18 November rather than waiting until he had obtained the notarised agreement, as the order provided a period of time for him to do.  Whilst, as I have recounted, the father now claims that he surrendered his driving licence before securing the notarised consent because it was more convenient for him to do so whilst on court on 18 November 2022, I reject that assertion.  </p>

Due to the failure on the part of the tagging company he was never tagged. He was thus unable to secure his driving licence and obtain the notarised agreement.</p>

By contrast with the orders subsequently made by Moore J on 16 December 2022 and Mr&#160;Colton KC on 9 January 2023, the father's driving licence was to be released to the <span style="font-style:italic">solicitors</span> for the father rather than to the father himself.  There was no link at all in ICC Judge Mullen's orders between the tagging order and the arrangements for the release of the father's driving licence, in order to allow him to identify himself to the notary, and thereby comply with the order to provide the notarised agreement.  In the circumstances the fact that the father was not tagged did not, under the terms of ICC Judge Mullen's order prevent him from complying with the latter order.  Notwithstanding this the father failed to provide a notarised agreement.</p>

Those orders did create a link between the tagging order and the arrangements for the release of the father's driving licence in order to allow him to identify himself to the notary and thereby comply with the order to provide his notarised agreement.  They provided for the temporary release of the father's driving licence to the father on condition that that release did not take place until confirmation was received that the electronic tag had been fitted to the father.  In these circumstances the father contends that the tagging order of Moore J and Mr Colton KC prevented him from complying with the order to provide a notarised consent, because the tagging company did not attend to tag him at the time specified by the tagging order.  I reject the father's contention that it was the conduct of the tagging company that prevented his compliance with the orders.</p>

The records provided by the tagging company, again on which the father himself relies and does not dispute, indicate that their representatives attended to place the electronic tag on the father at 10.40 p.m. on 15 December 2022.  The father did not answer the door and a contact letter was left at the property.  A further attempt was made on 16 December 2022 at 10.54 p.m., and further attempts were made on 19 December 2022 at 11.19 p.m., 20 December at 10.03 p.m. and 23 December at 10.00 p.m.  On each occasion there was no answer and on each occasion it was not possible therefore for the tag to be fitted.</p>

They received no answer from the property and a letter was left.  A further attempt was made on 10 January 2023 at 10.09 with the same results, and again on 11 January at 11.27 p.m. with the same results.

In respect of the order of Moore J, the tagging company had made a prior attempt to tag the father at 10.40 p.m. on 15 December 2022.  Within the time that had been set by Moore J and continued to make repeated attempts to do so after that time.  With respect to the order of Mr Colton KC, whilst the evidence indicates that the tagging company were late by an hour and an half by reference to the tagging time specified in the order, it would surely be an undesirable counsel of perfection to hold that the order of Mr Colton KC was not able to have been complied with by reason of a tagging company being an hour and a half late.  Indeed it would be a charter to frustrate unjustifiably the operation of such orders as I am satisfied the father proceeded to do, particularly in circumstances where the tagging company thereafter made repeated attempts to tag the father, albeit without success.</p>

The power of the Family Court to suspend a sentence is separate from the power of the criminal to suspend the sentence.  In particular, in the Family Court, the sentence may be suspended on terms.  </p>

First, it upholds the authority of the court by marking the disapproval of the court and deterring others from engaging in conduct comprising contempt.  Secondly, it acts to ensure future compliance.  In some cases, therefore, and, in particular, those cases where the contempt arises from a breach of the court order, a penalty with have the primary objective of ensuring future compliance with that order.  </p>

In particular, Mr Lennard invites me to take account of the fact that M does not wish for his father to go to prison as a result of his continued and contumelious breaches of court orders.</p>

I have, of course, considered very carefully those mitigating factors.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">However, against this, I am satisfied that in this case there are very significant aggravating factors.  The aggravating factors in this case include the repeated breaches of court orders over an extended period of time.  The father has deliberately, in my judgment, failed to comply with no less than four orders of the High Court, despite repeated opportunities being given to him by this court to allow compliance.  Notwithstanding those repeated opportunities, the father has repeatedly set his face, deliberately, against the compliance with the orders of the High Court.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">A further aggravating factor in this case is what I am satisfied has been the father&#8217;s wilful acting in a manner designed to make compliance with the orders difficult or impossible as a result of his own conduct.  In particular, his early surrendering of his driving licence under the order of Newton J and his lawful misinterpretation of the order of ICC Judge Mullen with respect to tagging and his repeated avoidance of the representatives of the tagging company when they made repeated attempts to tag him.</p>

Those assertions have been given without caveat.  The continued multiple breaches, it must also be noted, have left the children stranded in the jurisdiction of Iran for an extended period.  </p>

I am further satisfied that the appropriate sentence in this case is one of 6 months&#8217; imprisonment.  </p>
