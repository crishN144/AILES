	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to set this question in context.  DD&#8217;s medical notes (more fully available since the last hearing, and discussed by both Dr. F and Dr. Rowlands) reveal that during her childhood and adult life she has periodically received advice about contraception, and has been prescribed, and has used, different forms of contraception.  The evidence appears to show that the contraceptive pill was first prescribed for DD when she was 12 years old.  Her first Depo-Provera injection was in March 2000 but she was unwilling to use it again after 2 injections because of heavy bleeding, and in September 2000 she requested to go back on the oral contraceptive pill.  There is a note of a discussion between DD and her GP in March 2002 at which DD requested contraception &#8211; the GP discussed a range of contraceptives including the pill, coil and implants, and DD agreed to an implant.  The GP inserted the implant later that month although it was in place only briefly as, in fact at that time it transpired, DD was pregnant with Child 1; accordingly, the implant was removed.  Following Child 1&#8217;s birth, a further implant was inserted.  In September 2003, the family planning clinic prescribed the oral contraceptive pill in addition to the existing implant.  In December 2003, DD attended her GP requesting sterilisation (this was not the first time she had made this request).  A specific referral for sterilisation was made in January 2005.  When seen in hospital two months later, that request was refused as her motives were felt to be inconsistent and therefore unreliable.  In October 2005, DD attended the family planning clinic and underwent the re-insertion of a contraceptive implant.  This was removed in 2008, and at that time she indicated that she and her partner would use condoms.  Later in 2008 she sought advice on becoming pregnant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">While accepting that not all notes are available to me, it is nonetheless apparent that DD&#8217;s capacity to take decisions in relation to contraception does not appear to have been questioned in these numerous interactions with medical professionals over a number of years.  She appears (on the face of the documents) to have been able to understand and weigh information relevant to various contraceptive methods, and communicate her complaints about the various side effects of the different forms of contraception. She had requested sterilisation when in a relationship with her first partner, and was able to make a choice to stop contraception when with BC.</p>

If a capacitous woman would be informed when deciding about contraception that pregnancy for her entailed additional risks, this must be information relevant to her decision whether to avoid those risks by taking contraception.  Not to include such information as relevant information would disempower decision making.  The Official Solicitor argues that the factors in &#167;17 are simply an application of the first of Bodey J&#8217;s criteria.  While I do not accept that submission, I am nonetheless satisfied on the facts of this unusual case that these factors are truly &#8216;proximate&#8217; to the decision which DD has to understand and weigh, at this time, with her particular obstetric history, and should properly be regarded as &#8216;relevant information&#8217; for the purposes of the capacity determination.</p>

As before (8 April 2014, and 19 June 2014) efforts will be made to keep DD (and BC) calm prior to and during any intervention.  Once at the Community Health Centre DD will be allowed time to relax, before the process is explained to her; she will then be encouraged and persuaded, in accordance with the Code, to accept the assessment.  The plan, once again, appropriately emphasises the importance of using the least degree of restraint of DD, and encroaching on DD&#8217;s human rights, dignity and autonomy to the minimum extent necessary and only as a last resort to save her life, or prevent a serious deterioration in her mental health.</p>

Even though it appears from DD&#8217;s history that the minimum period between delivery and conception has been seven months, the only available evidence relates to live births, not undocumented miscarrriages.  It is a point of concern (as I previously mentioned: &#167;149 of <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/11" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 11" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 11</ref>) that the day after DD was discharged from hospital following the birth of Child 4 by emergency caesarean, she consulted her GP asking for the &#8216;morning after&#8217; pill. </p>

Two forms of temporary contraception have been specifically discussed, namely:</p>

This is a short-term contraceptive; the side effects can include heavy and irregular bleeding, fluid retention, bloating, fatigue, dizziness and abdominal pain; there is limited evidence that if a patient has a current pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis that Depo-Provera is contraindicated; even though DD has a history of embolism, it is not thought (per Mr. A) that a single injection will have an adverse effect; this form of contraception can reduce bone mineral density, though (again per Mr. A) this is unlikely to be relevant with one dose.  For the avoidance of doubt, a new DMPA formulation &#8211; Sayana Press &#8211; was referred to by Dr. Rowlands, but has no benefits (for present debate) over Depo-Provera.</p>

Hormone is released at a constant rate, and this would be effective for up to three years.  The implant is reasonably easily removable (it is implanted just under the skin, and a determined person could remove the rod with a sharp instrument); insertion and removal is more invasive than an injection (it requires the insertion of a rod), and would have to be removed by surgical intervention.  Some women develop heavy bleeding with an implant other side effects include breast pain, dizziness, and abdominal pain.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">DD has experience of both of these forms of contraception.  Regrettably both have caused her some adverse side-effects. DD was injected with Depo-Provera in 2002; records show that she suffered some of the well-known side-effects associated with this &#8211; namely irregular and heavy bleeding.  In 2003, she is reported to have suffered heavy bleeding following the insertion of an implant; she also found that the implant irritated her skin.  I bear this evidence in mind, but consider that one or other of these forms of contraception needs to be used as a short-term measure for DD at this time. </p>

The injection may be given while DD is sedated by general anaesthetic for the purposes of the caesarean section.   This is the least restrictive form of contraceptive while assessments are undertaken in relation to her capacity more generally.  I agree with them that this form of contraception at this stage is likely to be in DD&#8217;s best interests.</p>
