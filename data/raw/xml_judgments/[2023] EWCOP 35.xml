It had been the anticipation of the court that the applicants and third respondent would seek section 16, 2005 Act orders that it would be in Mr K&#8217;s best interests to be conveyed from his care home to hospital in an ambulance for the urgent investigation, assessment and treatment of the, likely, seriously infected ulcers.

The evidence was said to demonstrate a high risk of cardiac arrest, brought about by either or both of the risks of: (i) chemical and physical restraint whilst being conveyed to hospital; (ii) and/or prolonged sedation within hospital. The applicants sought an adjournment and permission to file further evidence. </p>

At that hearing, following submissions and consideration of the written evidence, interim declarations were made that there is reason to believe Mr K lacks capacity to make decisions about the treatment of his ulcers and ancillary care (including physical and chemical restraint) and orders were made that it was in his best interests for a clinical team to assess him at the care home, with the use of physical or chemical restraint, if necessary.  Set out below are my reasons for making the interim declarations and best interests orders sought. </p>

The papers in the court bundle, understandably, have a heavy focus on his current psychiatric and medical challenges. The papers state that Mr K is said to have been born in Nigeria and travelled to the United Kingdom with his mother and two brothers when he was around eight years old. There is a reference to him having studied economics and as having worked as a mini-cab driver. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Much of the history is dominated by charting his mental health challenges. Concerns were raised in 2007 about threatening correspondence sent to the then Prime Minister and the need for a threat assessment to be undertaken. In 2009 it is said Mr K was detained pursuant to section 3 <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref></span> (hereafter &#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref>&#8221;) for a period of five months at a mental health hospital in North London. It appears after his release from liability to be detained he refused to leave the hospital and remained there until 2011. It is then believed he lived outside of the United Kingdom before being returned to the United Kingdom with assistance from the British Consular authorities in Spain, where concerns had arisen because he was attempting to travel to Africa by bus. He was homeless for some time when he returned. </p>

In April 2016 Mr K was found unconscious and was admitted to hospital. Notes suggest he was diagnosed with &#8216;end stage cardiac failure&#8217;. He was offered follow up cardiology appointments but did not attend them. During this admission the second respondent is reported to have terminated the tenancy in respect of his home and he was offered a placement at a supported living placement. He refused to accept this and is said to have forced entry to his previous home and as a result ended up &#8216;on remand&#8217; in prison for two months. In 2016 he was detained pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref> and was prescribed antipsychotic medication.

I note it is reported that in those proceedings, in a report dated 30 October 2019, a clinician opined that it would be unsafe to physically or chemically restrain or sedate Mr K in the event of any resistance, &#8220;as this may precipitate an episode of heart failure or death.&#8221; </p>

He was assessed as lacking capacity to make decisions about his care and residence in May 2018 by a consultant psychiatrist. In March 2019 he was assessed by a different consultant psychiatrist to lack capacity to make decisions about his residence and his physical health conditions including his cardiomyopathy. His inability to make decisions was said to arise as a result of his delusional beliefs. In May 2019 another psychiatrist concluded his delusional beliefs meant he lacked capacity in respect of making decisions about his residence. In a section 49, 2005 Act report dated 31 July 2019, the author concluded that on balance Mr K lacked capacity to make decisions about his treatment, care needs and residence, albeit it was noted a thorough assessment was required. </p>

The proceedings were deemed to be a section 21A challenge to the second respondent&#8217;s standard authorisation, granted between 27 May 2019 and 26 May 2020 to authorise Mr K&#8217;s deprivation of liberty. An order was made by District Judge Ellington to transfer Mr K from the hospital to a care home in December 2019. A recital to an order from January 2020 noted that Mr K resisted the attempts to transfer him, absconded so he could not be transferred and on three occasions had been found in possession of an improvised weapon. In March 2020 the proposed care home stated they would not accept Mr K. The proceedings were ended by order of DJ Ellington on 12 February 2021 as Mr K had capacity. </p>

It sought orders for Mr K to be conveyed to, and reside and be cared for, at a care home.    </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">Mr K is subject to a standard authorisation in a care home following five years spent in a mental health facility in which he was not detained but which he refused to leave. He suffers from persistent delusions and paranoia and refuses to engage with professionals. He has a long-standing heart condition which makes any treatment against his will extremely difficult to carry out. Previous orders of the Vice President Theis J have authorised his successful conveyance from hospital to a care home with provision for physical and chemical restraint &#8211; neither of which was in fact required. Mr K has longstanding leg ulcers which he has previously treated himself. He refuses to allow staff or other medical professionals to assist him or assess them. Staff at his care home are now concerned, however, that the wounds are foul smelling and may be demonstrative of significant infection: one staff member reports vomiting at the smell and seeing &#8220;bone&#8221; when dressings were removed. In light of the seriousness of the issues, reallocation to a Tier 3 Judge is considered necessary and appropriate. </p>

Dr Barker considered then that Mr K had a persistent delusional disorder and that he lacked capacity to make decisions about his care and treatment.  Dr Barker helpfully summarises the wealth of written reports in respect of Mr K&#8217;s mental health and the various capacity assessments undertaken. He undertook a review of the records and summarised them. He recounted that he met with Mr K and spoke with him in the corridor but Mr K politely declined to be assessed in the absence of a paper version of a court order. He did not accept Dr Barker&#8217;s offer of seeing the order contained in his laptop. He refused to be assessed.</p>

Dr Barker discounted a hypothesis that Mr K has feigned psychiatric symptoms and manipulating health and care workers to prolong his stay in hospital. After a full history and a careful and balanced analysis Dr Barker arrived at the following conclusions:</p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;Both chemical and/or physical restraint will have an adverse effect on the cardiovascular system. Physical restraint may result in an increase in pulse rate and blood pressure, or conversely chemical restraint may lead to a fall in blood pressure. All of these might impact adversely on Mr K&#8217;s cardiological condition. He has very little cardiological reserve on the basis of the evidence that is at present available. When Mr K expresses aggressive behaviour his pulse and/or blood pressure are already likely increased. Further increase in blood pressure would increase the workload on his heart, which would increase the risk of both heart failure and arrhythmia. Equally, chemical restraint may result in a fall in blood pressure which results in less blood flow to the coronary arteries and increases the risk of arrhythmia when the ability of the heart to compensate for a fall in blood pressure, as in Mr K&#8217;s case, is poor. </p>

If there are arterial issues, i.e. the blood supply is restricted, then the ulcers may not heal. This can be ascertained by an ultrasound scan or a CT angioplasty. If there are venous issues this would be identified by duplex scan, and if issues are identified then this would be treated by way of percutaneous procedures by ablating the veins. This would improve the &#8216;environment&#8217; in which the ulcer is able to heal. In Mr K&#8217;s case, it could take weeks in hospital for the infection to subside before beginning such treatment. Patients would ordinarily be sent home, but Mr K probably would not be. It is also noted Mr K has critically impaired circulation to his foot and therefore an arterial procedure may need to be carried out more quickly.

Should Mr K experience a decrease in his blood pressure or pending cardiovascular collapse we would initiate inotropic/ vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure and the cardiovascular system. This may not reverse the cardiovascular collapse and is very difficult to withdraw at the end of the assessment period.

This would have to take account the aforementioned risks to his physiological state as mentioned in previous reports but could be a one-off sedation for a short period of time to enable the dressing to be removed and a healthcare professional to view the ulcers. This could be managed using agents he has previously received when transferred to the care home. I have not seen any statements commenting on the depth of sedation achieved with these agents &#8211; this may not be sufficient to cover any pain experienced when removing the dressing and hence a risk assessment would need to be made to ensure the health care workers are kept safe. The rationale for this is to enable a suitably qualified healthcare professional to view the ulcers which we believe have not been seen for many months or at all by someone able to assess them. This may help us plan the future direction of care. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">We do not currently consider there to be a safe way of managing Mr K even if we can manage a transfer to the hospital door, the ongoing care once in the hospital is extremely difficult and high risk.

She visited him at B Home on 17 July 2023. The B Home staff told her that Mr K had been difficult and was &#8220;bullying&#8221; but he was now quieter. The staff member said that Mr K does not like A Hospital. Mr K said to the staff member he was a prisoner at B Home.   Ms Varley tried to engage with Mr K but he was resistant to accepting that he had a solicitor. He was very focused on the fact the B Home staff had opened a letter addressed to him without his consent. Mr Varley records the following:</p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that &#8220;It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless&#8221;. But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221;</p>

On the one hand, he needs an urgent assessment of, and treatment for, his chronic bilateral venous leg ulcers. Without this, the evidence suggests, an infection may become sufficiently serious that amputation of both legs below the knee will be indicated. He remains resistant to professional assessment of his ulcers at B Home. He remains resistant to being returned to hospital for investigations and treatment. As far back as 26 June 2023 serious concerns were raised in respect of the urgent necessity of treatment of the ulcers. A member of staff noted they could see bone appear in the wound. After a short period of time in Mr Ks&#8217; room, the manager of B Home rushed out to vomit, over-powered by the smell of the wounds. Urgent safeguarding concerns were raised at round table meeting in June 2023.</p>

He thinks the wounds have not been dressed since 17 July 2023. He states that Mr K screams in pain, mainly at night. Notwithstanding this, Mr K refused assistance from B Home staff and from tissue viability nurses and will &#8220;never allow anybody to touch his leg and will retaliate with force if someone tries&#8230;&#8221;.

Dr Barker&#8217;s report provides a wealth of information about Mr K&#8217;s mind and brain and the extent to which it impaired or disturbed. Dr Barker&#8217;s opinion in September 2022 was that Mr K had a persistent delusional disorder or if he was wrong about that a personality disorder. Dr M, follow his assessment in July 2023, concluded Mr K has paranoid personality disorder. I am in no doubt that there is reason to believe that Mr K has an&#160;impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain. This is based on the evidence summarised above. It is not necessary for me to identify, certainly for the purposes of meeting the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 48</ref> 2005 test, the exact nature of the impairment or what is the correct diagnosis in August 2023 (see  <span style="font-style:italic">North Bristol NHS Trust v R</span>).</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">No party sought to persuade the court that Mr K has capacity to make decisions in respect of the treatment of his chronic bilateral venous leg ulcers. I am satisfied applying the statutory principles set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> that there is reason to believe that Mr K is unable to make decisions about the treatment options. I accept the written evidence of Dr M following his recent assessment that Mr K is unable to weigh the relevant information in respect of the treatment for his ulcers. This is largely because of his paranoid preoccupations and obsessions. Mr K is reported to be screaming at night in pain, yet will not permit a tissue viability nurse to assess his malodorous wounds. All the evidence points to there being reasons to believe he cannot make a decision for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref>. His ability to understand and weigh the necessary relevant information has been undermined by his irrational preoccupations and his distrust of professionals. The &#8216;matter&#8217; before him is the urgent investigation, assessment and treatment of his ulcers. The relevant information plainly includes the facts that: i. his wounds are in a very poor state; ii. his ulcers have not been assessed for weeks; iii. there is a high risk the wounds are infected; iv. there is a need for urgent assessment and treatment; v. without this he is at risk of severe infections which may compromise his venous and arterial systems and may lead to the necessity of amputation (if that is even possible given his cardiac presentation). There may well be other relevant information, I have not been addressed on this, given the urgency of the situation. Considering the &#8216;matter&#8217;, the likely relevant information and all the information about Mr K&#8217;s recent responses over the last two months, I am entirely satisfied there is reason to believe he lacks capacity to make the relevant decision. The decision includes ancillary treatment matters related to the immediate need to assess and investigate his chronic bilateral venous leg ulcers. There is reason to believe that the  inability to make the decision is caused by impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain, which is evidenced by both Dr Barker and Dr M, albeit their diagnoses are slightly different.</p>

I note, of course, that Mr K was conveyed from hospital to B Home in late March 2023 without incident. However, in the interim and until further, clearer evidence emerges, I am persuaded, and indeed no party sought to persuade me otherwise, that now is not the time for conveyance to hospital for assessment with the use of chemical and physical restraint. That being said, that is a finely balanced assessment, given that it is likely, on the evidence of the vascular surgeons, that some form of inpatient investigations will be needed, for scans etc to assess the damage to Mr K&#8217;s venous and arterial system and to assess whether or not his wounds are capable of healing. Option three is not <span style="font-style:italic">currently</span> in his best interests, but I anticipate that the evidence which emerges from the assessment to take place this week (see below) and the evidence from the two experts instructed by the Official Solicitor, will result in the court confronting the acutely difficult dilemma of balancing the risks to Mr K&#8217;s physical and psychological health of non-admission to hospital and therefore limited treatment at B Home for his chronic bilateral venous leg ulcers, against the cardiac risks of chemical and physical restraint in, or being conveyed, to hospital. This will be a difficult balancing act and will require clear, expert evidence to assist the court to undertake the balancing exercise in Mr K&#8217;s best interests. </p>

I very much take into account Mr K&#8217;s wishes and feelings and his resistance to any form of assessment or treatment of his ulcers. However, his refusal to have them treated is endangering his physical and psychological health in a manner the court cannot permit, given the interim declaration on his capacity. I also acknowledge there are risks to both his physical health and his psychological health of the assessment. There are cardiac risks posed by even the limited use of chemical and/or physical restraint that may be necessary to permit the assessment of his ulcers at B Home. I weigh them in the balance. I also weigh up the reported concerns of the manager at B home who is concerned about the impact of Mr K of the assessment taking place in Mr K&#8217;s home, his room at B Home. But weighing these matters, the balance comes down in favour of authorising the use of chemical and physical restraint to permit the assessment and investigation of the chronic bilateral venous leg ulcers. Continuing to permit them to go un-treated is not a humane option. They are plainly painful and whether or not there is already an infection (it is likely there is), untreated they will further compromise Mr K&#8217;s physical and psychological health and result in further harm to him. Dr W and Prof R support assessment with limited chemical or physical restraint at B Home. Dr W will be present at B Home to oversee Mr K&#8217;s response.  </p>

If, as seems very likely, Mr K declines assessment, as he has to-date when other professionals such as GPs, TVNs, or paramedics have attended, there could then perhaps be an attempt to administer oral Lorazepam covertly.  As currently drafted it appears likely, should Mr K refuse the assessment when invited by Mr S to consent, that IM sedation will thereafter need to be administered under some physical restraint.</p>

The order will be accompanied with a short letter from me asking him to consent to the assessment because the court is very concerned for him. It will emphasise the court has authority to do so and ask for him to cooperate.  The letter and order shall be provided to Mr K in a sealed envelope a little before the assessment. I am told by the parties, and I have read in the notes, that Mr K can be very respectful of authority. He refused to be assessed by Dr Barker because he did not have a paper copy of the order. He was concerned about Ms Varley&#8217;s letter of engagement  and concerned that his correspondence had been opened by B Home staff. I think it likely an envelope with a short letter and order will have marginal impact on Mr K, but if there is a possibility, even a remote one, that this would reduce the risks to him of the assessment, then it should be attempted.</p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;All Counsel agree that an application made pursuant to Section 21A does not permit the making of an interim declaration pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 48</ref>. Indeed, they submit that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 48</ref> itself does not permit the making of interim declarations, notwithstanding that this is almost universally the practice. As set out at para 29, above <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 48</ref> provides for the making of an order or for the giving of directions. It does not provide for the making of a declaration. Thus, the Court's finding that there is reason to believe that P lacks capacity ought, strictly, not to be phrased in declaratory terms. Ms Butler-Cole also argues that, as the COPR 2017 describe an interim declaration as an "interim remedy", there can be no interim remedy in a Section 21A MCA application. As P is deprived, lawfully, of his liberty under a standard authorisation, the only remedy, it is argued, must be termination or variation of the standard authorisation.&#8221;</p>

A determination that there is reason to believe P lacks capacity in relation to the matter, is an important steps which establishes the court has jurisdiction to make best interests orders in respect of P, if additionally the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 48</ref> (c) test of &#8216;without delay&#8217; is met.
