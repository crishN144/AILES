How should a Property and Affairs Deputy approach the issue of whether to inform P of the value of their civil litigation settlement? I am told, on behalf of the Applicant, PSG Trust Corporation Limited, the Deputy appointed for both CK and NJ, that this is a predicament which deputies regularly face and in respect of which it is thought that there is no clear guidance. The hearing was originally listed on 4</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> May 2023 but it was adjourned to provide for updating evidence to be filed by the Applicant and for enquiries to be made of members of the Professional Deputies Forum, to evaluate the extent of the concern and, if it were possible, to identify current practice amongst professional deputies. </span></p>

I am grateful to her for agreeing to do so. It is perhaps important to emphasise that the Official Solicitor does not act in the present applications as Litigation Friend for either CK or NJ.

I am uncomfortable with this formulation. It does not seem to me to capture the matter with sufficient clarity. In many respects, we have no control over what people tell us and, it follows, no decision to take. The essence of this is whether CK or NJ have the capacity to understand the value of their personal injury funds and appreciate the extent to which wider knowledge of their assets may render them vulnerable. If not, a best interests decision requires to be taken as to whether they should be told the size of their funds. </span></p>

I have read those responses and I am grateful to Mr Holmes, who acts on behalf of the Official Solicitor, for his helpful and accurate summary of them. There were 11 responses in total, slightly under half of them indicated that this question arose frequently, whilst the others encountered it only rarely. Most indicated that they would obtain medical evidence of capacity to request information about the size of the award, though three said that they would not normally do so. One deputy thought that the question of what information should be given was not within his/her authority. Most considered that the decision was and should be capable of being taken by the deputy, but the deputy should refer to the court in cases of obvious difficulty or controversy. </span></p>

One respondent identified, as a relevant factor, the issue of whether disclosure to P would be necessary in order to facilitate the making of a will or a prenuptial agreement.

This is so much a feature of the day-to-day work of the Court of Protection that it is unnecessary to set it out here. The case law, a good deal of it building upon the jurisprudence prior to the introduction of the Act can, in my view, also be regarded as providing a clear foundation for decision-making, in what is a highly fact-specific jurisdiction. The application of the law can, however, often be challenging. Given the sensitive ethical issues presented by these cases, it is useful to distil some central, non-exhaustive principles: </span></p>

Nonetheless, the Claimant has expressed his views on the matter without the exact figure being known to him and there is evidence (particularly in his comment after he left the videoconference room after giving his evidence) that his ability to make this decision is variable and that he could not necessarily sustain over any meaningful period the making of such a decision given his inability to control his impulses and weigh up all the relevant considerations&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. </span></p>

Mr Barry has expressed the view that this particular "best interests" decision is not a decision that falls within the scope of his appointment. Ms Butler-Cole suggests that paragraph 1(a) of the Deputyship order (see paragraph 8 above) gives him authority "to make decisions on behalf of [EXB] that he is unable to make for himself in relation to his property and affairs &#8230;." She submits that the decision whether to inform the Claimant of the details of his settlement "can properly be construed to be within the Deputy's powers, being a decision in relation to his property and affairs." Mr Vincent submitted that this was not so clear and that the "conditions or restrictions" in paragraph 2, to which the power conferred in paragraph 1 are subject, lends a more restrictive interpretation to the apparently wide-ranging nature of that power.</span></p>

Indeed this would also remove the burden of being perceived as a gatekeeper of such information from the litigation friend, litigation solicitor, or member of the support team. If it were otherwise, it would set the Deputy (or anyone else that EXB perceives to be gatekeeper) as the arbiter of such issues which would be unwelcome and potentially divisive.</span></p>

I do not accept that a valid prenuptial agreement&#160;cannot&#160;be made without knowledge of the value of one's assets. Accordingly, the premise of Mr Rees's submission falls away. I can readily envisage a situation where the judge could decide that somebody has the capacity to enter into a prenuptial agreement but does not have the capacity to know about the extent of their assets. I have already highlighted, above, the obvious disadvantages in this factual state of affairs which is, I suggest, one that we should strive to avoid if at all possible.</span></p>

However, a decision as to whether a person should be told about the value of his assets is a wholly artificial one.   A capacitous person does not ask ever themselves whether they should be made aware of the extent of their assets. If they do not have the relevant knowledge to hand, they have a right to obtain that information should they wish to obtain it.   As is clear from Foskett J&#8217;s judgment (para [33]) he had difficulty in assessing EXB&#8217;s capacity in that regard&#8221;. </span></p>

Should disclosure to P be regarded as automatic and as of right; is disclosure a facet of management of P&#8217;s property and affairs, already determined to be a sphere in which P lacks capacity, hence the appointment of the deputy, and how should the capacity test be framed where the focus of concern is on P&#8217;s vulnerability. </span></p>

A deputy is a creature of statute, arguably standing, in relation to P, in a position equivalent or at least similar to that of agent or trustee in relation to a principal or a beneficiary. Plainly, a principal and a beneficiary both have automatic rights to the provision of an account from their agent or trustee, stating what assets are being held on their behalf; </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">[2003] UKPC 26; [2003] 2 A.C. 709</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">. Restricting P&#8217;s access to that information, on any grounds, might be said to discriminate against P by imposing constraints which do not exist for capacitous individuals in similar situations. Further, it is suggested that this has the potential to restrict the scrutiny by P, her family, friends, and advisers of the decisions taken by the deputy and, consequentially, contracts the opportunity for redress in law. Finally, restricting information to P might limit a wider range of other decisions such as the capacity to make a will or a prenuptial agreement. </span></p>

However, as was discussed in exchanges with both Mr Holmes and Miss Collinson, there are various circumstances in which we all, as capacitous individuals, may have to decide about whether we want to know particularly challenging information. Sometimes the decision will be further refined so that we may want to know some parts of it but not others. Paradigmatically, when receiving a challenging medical prognosis, a patient may want to know about likely pain, disability, medication but not life expectancy. Another example was that of a care leaver deciding whether to ask the Local Authority for their records. That decision would involve a variety of considerations: would I discover facts about my childhood that will upset me and remain with me? Will it affect my relationships with my adoptive parents or my biological parents? What am I likely to gain from reading the information? Other examples canvassed are decisions to take tests for inherited diseases or DNA tests perhaps to identify genetic parents. </span></p>

Though P may lack capacity across a gamut of decision making in relation to finances and property, she may nonetheless, be assessed as having capacity on decisions such as this. It is important to emphasise that P is perceived to have capacity in respect of every decision she may confront unless that is dislodged by the evidence. It strikes me that Mr Rees&#8217;s superficially attractive submission risks subverting the autonomy of both the capacitous and the incapacitous, in an issue of this kind. It also collides with the presumption of capacity which is the cornerstone of the MCA. </span></p>

In fact, however, deputies ought to be alive to the possibility that P will have capacity to make some decisions about their property and affairs, and should allow P to do so. It is common for deputies regularly to pay limited amounts of money into an account to which P has access to enable P to spend money for themselves; this respects P&#8217;s dignity and autonomy and encourages co-operation between P and the deputy. Similarly, where P has capacity to decide whether or not she should be told the value of her award, the deputy should respect her request either to be told or not to be told&#8221;.</span></p>

It follows that if she does recognise, retain and weigh these problems and vulnerabilities, it is likely that the presumption that her decision is capacitous has not been rebutted. Of course, none of this causes the identified vulnerabilities to evaporate, they remain and they are real. However, the fact that she may make unwise decisions, in the future, which cause her to fall prey to exploitation, is, ultimately, to expose her, as we all must be to some degree, to the vicissitudes of life and human transgression. But the role of this court is to protect and promote human autonomy not to repress it with misconceived paternalism. A life wrapped in cotton wool is a restricted and diminished one. </span></p>

A conflict of interest or a perceived conflict of interest might arise if the agent were to decide that the amount of P&#8217;s funds under his control should not be disclosed to her. If an attorney under a Lasting Power considers that P should not be told the value of funds under his control, then the matter, Mr Holmes argues, requires to be referred to the Court for determination. I agree with this as, I understand, does the Official Solicitor. It has to be emphasised that the conflict of interest between the donor and donee of a Lasting Power of Attorney, identified above does not arise in the case of deputies who are appointed by the Court and not by P, required to submit annual accounts to the Public Guardian and subject to supervision. </span></p>

[CK]&#8217;s parents described a number of events and circumstances over the years where friends, acquaintances, and ex-boyfriends have attempted to manipulate and exploit [CK]. Unfortunately due to her complex neuropsychological deficits, [CK] is either less aware or completely unaware of the risks that she faces when exposed to such individuals. Previous issues that have arisen have included attempted financial abuse and emotional abuse that sounded a lot like gaslighting. As you know, on more than a few occasions, [CK]&#8217;s parents have had to step in and it is fortunate that she has such a loving and supportive family&#8221;.</span></p>

CK&#8217;s mother has also signalled that she can sometimes be careless about what she posts on social media and how that increases her vulnerability to exploitation. Alongside this, CK is good with numbers, understands the value of money and would be able to comprehend the extent of her settlement if it were given to her. Indeed, she already has formed a strikingly accurate estimate of the award for herself. However, there is little doubt that she cannot organise her own financial affairs and has, for example, on a number of occasions unknowingly signed up to subscription services which have gone on to take money from her without her knowledge. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Applying the test I set out in paragraph 3 above, I have come to the conclusion that CK lacks the capacity to take this decision for herself. Her primary area of deficiency lies in her inability to recognise her own vulnerability. However, it is clear that she understands the size of the award and has expressed a consistent wish to have the exact amount confirmed to her. She has some grasp of budgeting and recognises items of varying value. For example, I am told that she has a penchant for designer items and handbags. She also wishes to make a will and has expressed cogent reasons for this. It is illustrative of just how issue specific questions of capacity can be, that CK has been assessed as having testamentary capacity. CK also has the considerable benefit of a strong and protective family. This, along with the involvement of her Deputy provides significant, but not guaranteed, protection from exploitation. The Deputy considers that even if CK were to lack capacity in this sphere, as I have found, it, nonetheless considers it is in her best interests to do so. In coming to that conclusion it has emphasised a number of the factors I have set out above. In my view, knowledge of the exact amount of the settlement in this case is unlikely significantly to escalate CK&#8217;s vulnerability. As I have said, she has formed a highly accurate assessment of her award and spoken of it. The benefit of informing her of the precise amount is that it affords respect to her in the execution of her own autonomy. From what I have read about her, she will, I am satisfied, recognise something of this and will appreciate it. </span></p>

She required resuscitating on birth and experienced two intracerebral haemorrhages during the perinatal period. At 3 months of age, NJ was subjected to a severe shaking assault. She was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and has learning difficulties, right sided weakness and epilepsy which has not been containable on pharmacological intervention, although there appears to have been a relative improvement over the last 12 months. Dr Graeme Flaherty Jones, Consultant Clinical Psychologist and Clinical Director, makes the following observations in respect of NJ&#8217;s cognitive function:</span></p>

These difficulties area likely further compounded by the presence of epilepsy, which can lead to problems with attention, memory, and the speed at which information can be processed. The severity of the latter cognitive difficulties will inevitably vary depending on the stability of epilepsy symptoms and any comorbid sleep related difficulties&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">. </span></p>

Dr Flaherty Jones notes that NJ struggles to divide her attention when confronted by multiple stimuli which leads to heightened emotional frustration and, in turn, compromises her cognitive abilities. She has had a very difficult childhood. Her medical records include anxiety, anorexia, suicidal ideation, emotionally unstable personality disorder (borderline type). She has twice been detained under the Mental Health Act. I regard it as significant in my evaluation of the issues in this hearing that NJ has experienced significant traumatic events within relationships and struggles to form and maintain trusting relationships.</span></p>

She seems either unable to recognise the full extent of her disability in this sphere or indeed, may have no awareness of it at all. Her Deputy considers that she is unable to weigh or retain information pertinent to this decision but highlights that she does not want her brother to find out about the value of the award. However, when asked why, she struggles to identify the risk. She has </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#8220;an activity budget&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> the primary purpose of which is to afford her the opportunity to exercise some personal autonomy. The purpose of this has required regular work and reinforcement. At the time of drafting his report, Dr Flaherty Jones noted that there was no current care support package in place. When discussing how any financial award from her litigation may be used in the future, NJ was able to say </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#8220;it would be used to make sure I am supported&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">&#8220;to make sure I am settled&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Whilst there has been some relative improvement in NJ&#8217;s recent mental stability, the prognosis is that there is unlikely to be any fundamental change. She is noted to subjugate her own needs and focus on others. There is a history of financial abuse where money appears to have been taken from her, probably by her brother who is described as having an addiction to heroin. In my judgement, she is strikingly vulnerable to exploitation. Again, addressing the decision making criteria, I consider NJ lacks any insight into her own vulnerability. Further, it is unlikely that she will understand the size and value of the award if she were to be told of it. On a practical level, her deputy considers that it will be very difficult to manage her expectations of expenditure especially considering her very limited grasp of understanding the value of money. It is highly unlikely that NJ has or will develop testamentary capacity. I note that if a statutory will is required, it should be something which the Court would be able to order pursuant to Section 18(1)(i) of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Sadly, but inevitably, I have come to the conclusion that NJ does not have the capacity to understand or weigh the risk to herself if the sum of the award was disclosed to her. Moreover, the significance of the sum is not something she will be able to appreciate. I also consider that for all of the reasons discussed above, it is not in NJ&#8217;s best interests for the amount of the award to be disclosed to her. </span></p>
