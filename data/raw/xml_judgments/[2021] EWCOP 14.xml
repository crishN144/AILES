V has been living with Korsakoff&#8217;s syndrome, a form of alcohol-related brain damage, for over a decade. The applicant, SD, is V&#8217;s daughter who lives in New York, from where she has attended, remotely. SD seeks a declaration that it would not be lawful or in her best interests to administer V with a vaccine against Covid-19, or indeed, any other vaccine, on the basis that to do so would be contrary both to her best interests and to what SD contends would be her wishes. The respondent, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, opposes this declaration, as it considers that it would be in V&#8217;s best interests to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. </p>

Though her concerns are understandable, I have impressed upon her that it is her connection with V that counts i.e. that fact that she is her daughter and can be assumed to be well placed to help the court in evaluating her mother&#8217;s best interests.   </p>

V was plainly ambitious for her daughter and was able to ensure she received a good education. V worked hard to assist her daughter in gaining a scholarship to a very highly regarded school, which gave her a remarkable start in life. SD presents as confident and intelligent, and has enjoyed a very active career in sports, competing in and teaching snowboarding, living in various countries across the world. All this is in stark contrast to the hardships V faced as a young woman.  </p>

However, while living in Poland, she continued to visit her mother regularly, every couple of months.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Sadly, over the course of her life, V has struggled to regulate her use of alcohol. For many years she drank secretly and alone. Gradually her subterfuges became less efficient and eventually the extent of her drinking became obvious to SD. SD told me, and I accept, that in the decade before she was admitted to the care home, V incrementally lost her ability to conduct her life in any really effective way. SD spoke movingly of her efforts to curtail her mother&#8217;s drinking and her own gradual realisation that this was a forlorn hope. As she recounted this, SD betrayed no resentment towards her mother but the pain of this period in her life was obvious and continues to resonate. She told me that she had become the parent in the relationship. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">SD also told me that, historically, her mother had been, in her view, too deferential to those in authority, and to the medical profession, in particular. She trusted her doctors, unquestioningly following their advice. SD related an incident in which her mother had all her dental fillings replaced with ones which were, in SD&#8217;s view, of inferior quality. This arose, in SD&#8217;s opinion, as a result of a na&#239;ve and incurious reliance by her mother on a poor recommendation from a dentist. Though I am careful not to extrapolate too great a significance from this episode, it does cast some light on the way V has lived her life and her perhaps sometimes diffident compliance with the advice of medical professionals.  She is of an age and generation where such views were commonplace. SD has a very different approach to these relationships. She has lived, as I have said, a very different life to that of her mother. She is confident and speaks authoritatively. She queries and mistrusts advice, she prefers to make her own decisions. The two women are or at least have become, very different, at least in this sphere. I found it interesting to note that SD did not recognise this or appreciate that it might, in the context of the wider picture, undermine the case she was seeking to advance.    </p>

Mr A, her carer, told me of her robust, and sometimes slightly ribald, sense of humour. He told me that she had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;a gentleman friend&#8217;</span> with whom she sits, every afternoon, holding hands while watching television. Mr A explained that she enjoyed participating in the day-to-day running of the care home, for example, clearing away cutlery and cups after meals.

The care home has a professional and dedicated staff who, at considerable disruption to their own lives and to the lives of their families, have gone to enormous lengths to protect the residents. At some stages Mr A has moved into the home, separating himself from his family, to reduce risk of infection. Most of the residents, V included, are unable to appreciate the need for social distancing. In addition, and in light of the specialised care required, the care home has kept a rigid regime; there has been no &#8216;window&#8217; or &#8216;garden&#8217; contact with family or friends, only telephone and video conferencing.   </p>

She knew nothing of her daughter&#8217;s position. Mr A had to tell her that she was not to receive the vaccine. She waited for about twenty minutes in the room, and then drifted away. Her general level of functioning means that the issue has now gone from her mind and she has not returned to consider it. There is no question that V does not have the capacity any longer to evaluate the question of receiving the vaccine for herself. </p>

The Local Authority then began to consider the best way forward for V. It has taken nearly a month for the application to come before me. I indicated that I consider this delay to have been unsatisfactory. When an issue arises as to whether a care home resident should receive the vaccination, the matter should be brought before the court expeditiously, if it is not capable of speedy resolution by agreement. This is not only a question of risk assessment, it is an obligation to protect P&#8217;s autonomy. In the intervening period, Mr A told me that there was a suspected Covid-19 risk in the care home, which happily came to nothing.  It is axiomatic that if Covid-19 had entered the home, V would have been at considerable risk. It is important that I record that every other resident and staff member has now been vaccinated. </p>

Providing it is safe to do so, he hopes that the residents will be able to venture outside and go for walks, so that they will have something of their basic liberty restored to them.

SD considers that V was simply <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;following the herd&#8221;</span> when she lined up and received her flu vaccine and similarly when she put herself forward for the Covid-19 vaccine.

She has also told me that she has spent much of her life acting as &#8220;a parent&#8221; to her mother. I have no doubt that she considers herself to be doing the right thing and I am equally sure that she believes the decision ought to be hers and nobody else&#8217;s. In this respect, in my assessment and for understandable reasons, SD continues to think of herself as her mother&#8217;s parent. V is now an incapcitous adult, with a long independent life behind her, whose autonomy is protected by the framework of the MCA. In circumstances where an individual is not capacitous and cannot take medical decisions for themselves, the court is required, in the absence of agreement, to identify best interests for itself, surveying the entire canvas of the available evidence.  Strongly held views by well-meaning and concerned family members should be taken into account but never permitted to prevail nor allowed to create avoidable delay. To do so would be to expose the vulnerable to the levels of risk I have identified, in the face of what remains an insidious and highly dangerous pandemic virus.  </p>

He is not related to her and is not, in any biological sense, her family, but like so many carers of his calibre, he has filled a void generated by the pandemic. His views on whether a vaccine would be in V&#8217;s best interests are therefore important, and I do not think SD disagrees.

My task is to evaluate V&#8217;s situation in light of the authorised, peer-reviewed research and public health guidelines, and to set those in the context of the wider picture of V&#8217;s best interests.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Though she has argued her case forcefully, I have been left with the impression that SD is unable to disentangle her own anxieties about the vaccines and her personal scepticism relating to the process of endorsement, from her analysis of her mother&#8217;s best interests. SD&#8217;s advocacy for the use of ivermectin is both logically unsustainable and entirely inconsistent with her own primary position. I have no doubt that SD&#8217;s opposition to her mother receiving the vaccine is generated by real concern and distress. This, however, is not shared by her mother and does not reflect V&#8217;s own authentic view. None of this is to question SD&#8217;s sincerity, it is simply a reflection of the fact that filial love and concern can sometimes occlude rather than focus objective decision making. </p>

In cases such as this, there is a strong draw towards vaccination as likely to be in the best interests of a protected party (P). However, this </p>

What it is important to emphasise here, as in so many areas of the work of the Court of Protection,  is that respect for and promotion of P&#8217;s autonomy and an objective evaluation of P&#8217;s best interests will most effectively inform the ultimate decision. It is P&#8217;s voice that requires to be heard and which should never be conflated or confused with the voices of others, including family members however unimpeachable their motivations or however eloquently their own objections are advanced. </p>
