	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a tragic case. The sudden and wholly unexpected death of G has been the most appalling shock for the family. The grief and bewilderment of G&#8217;s mother (the Respondent to the application) is obvious. These events are very recent and very raw. I have nothing but the profoundest sympathy for them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 14 April 2024, G, aged 36, was transferred by ambulance to the Trust&#8217;s  Emergency department after ingesting 1.5 to 2 litres of engine coolant containing a lethal dose of ethylene glycol at home some 14 hours earlier. She presented with a Glasgow Coma Score of 4 (3 being the lowest and 15 the highest). She had low oxygen levels, an unstable cardiac rhythm and was experiencing multiple seizures. She was treated with anticonvulsants, intubated and taken to the ICU where she received multi-organ support. She is fully dependent on a mechanical ventilator. Her organs continue to be mechanically supported, but this is treatment which maintains them rather than sustaining life. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 15 May 2024, formal brain stem testing, including the apnoea test which by then could be carried out because her hypoxia had sufficiently stabilised, was performed by two qualified consultants in accordance with the Code of Practice. The testing was observed by G&#8217;s brother and 2 sisters, and by G&#8217;s mother for part thereof. The first set of tests began at 13.00 and fulfilled all the criteria for declaration of death by neurological criteria. There was clear evidence of irreversible brain damage, no red flags identified as potential confounders and no potentially reversible causes.  G&#8217;s time of death was recorded as being 13.30, which is when the first set of tests concluded. At 14.00 the second set of tests was carried out which confirmed the findings. That day, the Clinical Ethics Advisory Group reviewed the case and confirmed their agreement that G had been certified dead by appropriate methods. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The unanimous view of the ICU consultant body is that G is dead by neurological criteria in accordance with the Code of Practice. She has an irreversible cessation of brain stem function, a permanent absence of consciousness and an irreversible loss of capacity to breathe independently. The Trust proposes that mechanical support should be withdrawn within 24 to 48 hours, allowing the family time to prepare, visit and, if they wish, be present for the withdrawal of support.</p>

She, and the family, have been aware since at least the best interests meeting on 7 May 2024 that in the event of a dispute between the Trust and the parents, an application would be made to court. She has been kept informed of the clinical assessments throughout. She was served with the application on 17 May 2024. As was apparent during the hearing, she is well informed about the medical circumstances, and fully understands the Trust&#8217;s case about the conclusions of the brain stem testing. In general terms she has been aware of the Trust&#8217;s case for some time, and has had the opportunity to consider it, take medical advice of her own, secure legal representation and formulate her response. </p>

Nothing suggests that (i) the brain stem tests were not carried out in accordance with proper procedure, or (ii) the conclusions of the brain stem tests are wrong or (iii) there is the slightest doubt that she is, in neurological terms and by reference to the brain stem testing criteria, dead. Tragic though this is for the family, it is the inevitable conclusion.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The application (or claim) is brought under the Part 8 procedure set out in the Civil Procedure Rules where the claimant (usually the Hospital Trust) seeks the court&#8217;s decision &#8220;on a question which is unlikely to involve a substantial dispute of fact&#8221; (CPR 8.1(2).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Usually, where brain stem testing has been carried out, there will be no substantial dispute of fact. Hence, the Part 8 procedure is appropriate for cases of this nature.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">Under the rules, the claimant must file witness evidence with the claim form (CPR 8.5(1). In cases of this nature, that will ordinarily be one or more statements from clinicians. It is hard to conceive of any good reason why witness evidence should not be filed in accordance with this rule to set out the procedure and conclusions of the brain stem testing; after all, the case must be proved by the claimant.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The rules also provide for an acknowledgment of service by the defendant within 14 days of service of the claim form (CPR 8.3(1)(a)), which should be accompanied by any written evidence upon which the defendant seeks to rely (CPR 8.5(3).  There are then provisions for the claimant to file evidence in reply (CPR 8.5(6)). </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In my judgment, the strict application of these rules is unlikely to be appropriate, save, as I have suggested at iii) above, in respect of the obligation on the Hospital Trust to file evidence with the claim form. Applications for declarations of death by reason of brain stem testing are usually urgent in the sense that it is unreasonable to wait any length of time for determination of such sensitive matters. Absent legitimate reasons for questioning the validity of the tests and their conclusions, the court is likely to feel able to proceed to an expedited hearing, with a foreshortened timetable, requiring the defendant&#8217;s evidence to be produced in very short order, or perhaps dispensing with the need for formal evidence from the defendant altogether. This seems to me to be legitimate, and consistent with the overriding objective in Part 1 of the CPR, in circumstances where the evidence in respect of brain stem testing is, or appears to be, incontrovertible. It will, however, all depend on the facts of the case. I do not for one moment suggest that an expedited hearing will always be appropriate, but in my view it is likely to be so where there is no realistic basis advanced for challenging the testing procedures or conclusions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is nothing before me to suggest that the brain stem tests were not conducted rigorously in accordance with the Code of Practice. The conclusions of both tests were identical, and the medical practitioners were entitled to make a diagnosis of death. No other clinical tests have given any cause to think that the results of the brain stem tests are wrong, or that there is a reversible cause, or that clinical intervention will achieve a different outcome. The Trust has sought second opinions, and the unanimity of the clinical evidence is clear. G is, very sadly, dead; there are no reversible causes and there are no neurosurgical treatment options. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The position of the family, in particular G&#8217;s mother, is understandable but sadly futile. Many of the points raised, including complaints about aspects of treatment, had little or nothing to do with the brain stem testing. The family referred to a terrible incident in 2010 when G was critically ill in a coma, from which thankfully she recovered, but she was not pronounced dead in accordance with the brain stem test criteria and that recovery is not, to my mind, a justification for disputing the present diagnosis. Had she in fact been brain stem dead, as the clinician told me, she would not have recovered. G&#8217;s mother put forward an article to support a submission that the Code of Practice is not valid in that it is not a proper indicator of death. Essentially, she challenged the medical and legal definitions of death, but given the established authorities to which I have referred, and the contents of the Code of Practice, which govern both the medical and legal approach, that is not a sustainable argument. G&#8217;s mother also mentioned that when she massaged G&#8217;s feet, there were reflexes in the legs and feet, but the clinician explained that is not unusual even when a person is declared dead by reference to brain stem testing because separate spinal reflexes, travelling down to the feet, can continue; they are not a marker of life in neurological terms. </p>

There is no relevant gap in the evidence which needs filling. The brain stem tests were carried out in accordance with the Code of Practice and there is nothing to suggest that any further inquiry would reach a different conclusion. To allow more time in the hope of a miracle has no clinical justification. The family&#8217;s wish to retain a vestige of hope is beyond reproach, but it has no clinical or other foundation. </p>
