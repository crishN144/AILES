It was reported that she had vomited that day, which the mother had noticed had fresh blood in the vomit.  I have heard evidence from Dr&#160;Cohn in these proceedings in which he explained that the presence of blood in the vomit on that occasion was likely to have been caused by coughing due to the bronchiolitis.</span></p>

The same day, the mother and her partner, Mr Clay, were both arrested and were interviewed the next day.  On 26 October 2021, the mother consented to the children being accommodated under section 20 of the Children Act.  On 22 November 2021, the case came before me when I made interim care orders in relation to both children, and they remain subject to those orders ever since.  </span></p>

There was some discussion during this hearing about what was meant within the 111 call report, but I have listened to the audio recording and that has dispelled any confusion because the mother clearly says to the operator that she is under 10 weeks&#8217; pregnant.  The relevance of this is that because there was a real possibility that the mother believed she was pregnant at the time when the allegations against her and Mr Clay were being explored by the police. </span></p>

She had recently been unwell only a few weeks earlier with bronchiolitis and was coughing up blood and required being taken to hospital.  Therefore, there are a number of factors about Fiona which meant that she would have been demanding to meet her needs.  </span></p>

Firstly, it was not just Fiona that had to be cared for, there was also Emma.  Two children under two which means that there would have been a very high level of care needs for both of them in terms of feeding, cleaning, bathing, dressing, stimulating in their routines in general, as well as the particular need for constant supervision of the two girls when they are together because of Emma&#8217;s boisterous nature.  In addition, the flat was small and at times, certainly in the police photographs I have seen, it was untidy and messy.  </span></p>

I take judicial notice that cannabis use, which was admitted, is notorious for its damaging effect on mental health and it is particularly unwise for those with pre-existing mental health conditions.  </span></p>
