	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A safeguarding referral was made on 4 April 2023 by SR, Adult Congenital Nurse Specialist of the adult congenital cardiac services team at the local Hospital. LD was supposed to be attending a clinic in April 2023 for a face-to-face review with the Consultant, and for an ECHO and ECG. As stated, he was last seen in the clinic in 2018 and all appointments since then have been by telephone. SR spoke to RD on 4 April 2023 and was told that RD will not be bringing LD to the hospital in the near future as they are confined at home due to the risk of COVID, and also from other bugs which pose a risk to LD; and she was not prepared to put him at risk of those.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 11 April 2023 LG, a senior case social worker for RD, made contact with her to check on her well-being; she discussed the problems with the boiler and the need for a cardiac assessment of LD. LG discussed the plan for a GP visit, which RD said she did not want. On 17 April 2023 LG visited the home to request to see LD, but this was refused. LG reported that RD&#8217;s general demeanour was very unkempt; she was wearing a dirty dressing gown with hood up and grubby coat over the top. She was, however, very talkative and agreed that LG could update LD&#8217;s Care Act assessment, but only from the doorstep. LG noticed the house was in darkness, the garden weed-ridden and overgrown. On 19 April 2023 a visit was attempted by the GP and the duty social worker, but RD would not answer the door, and by telephone explained that she would not accept a visit. On 20 April 2023 SG, a senior social worker,  telephoned RD to discuss the concerns raised by the hospital and asked if she would be willing to allow a visit; but RD was again very clear that she would not let anyone in the house and would remain housebound, until she feels it is necessary. LG tried on further occasions to engage RD over the phone, but on 24 April 2023 RD asked her not to call again.</p>

LD requires health checks to ensure he is not in pain, due to possible pressure sores and risk to his health due to his heart condition. He is at risk of falls. He requires a general health assessment by a GP. In particular, he may be at risk of pressure sores and he will need to be assessed for appropriate treatment. He requires a cardiology assessment (ECHO and ECG). He requires Speech and Language Therapy with regard to his dysphagia. He requires Occupational Therapy and possibly physiotherapy to look at mobility issues. He will need a medication review and to be supported to ensure he takes medication. He needs to be gradually supported to engage in social activities.</p>

Support workers that have worked with LD describe him has having a severe learning disability with very limited verbal communication. LD will for example use some single words, but only if prompted to do so. They report that LD has limited ways of communicating his needs and this was confirmed by a previous day service, who worked with him in 2015.&#8221;</p>

For if it meant that &#8220;it is more probable than not that P lacks capacity in relation to the matter&#8221; then the provision would be otiose because the Court would already have reached the required degree of probability or likelihood to find that incapacity is proved and could go straight to making a substantive declaration under s.15.</p>

It could be a future event that has been stymied and where the litigation is about recompense for its loss. So, where an interlocutory injunction is sought by a claimant to prevent the use pending trial of a product said to have been developed in breach of a patent, the future event condition to be satisfied is whether the claimant will succeed at trial (see <span style="font-style:italic">American Cyanamid v Ethicon </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1975] AC 396" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1975">[1975] AC 396</ref>).

You can prove that a past event happened, but you cannot prove that a future event will happen and I do not think that the law is so foolish as to suppose that you can.
