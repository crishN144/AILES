The provisions under consideration include the selection and appointment of relevant person&#8217;s representatives under Part 10 of Schedule A1 and independent mental capacity advocates under s.39D which have not, so far as I am aware, been considered in any previous judgment. More fundamentally, the case addresses the question of the extent of the duty on a local authority to ensure that a person who lacks capacity is able to challenge a deprivation of their liberty. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">AJ is now aged 88. She has lived in her local area all her life. In 2002, she moved to live in an annexe of the home of her niece and her husband (hereafter referred to as &#8220;Mr and Mrs C&#8221;). Like many elderly people, AJ sadly developed vascular dementia and became increasingly dependent on others, in particular Mrs. C. She was, however, very reluctant to acknowledge her condition, and insistent that she could manage without any help. On one occasion, when Mr and Mrs. C went away on holiday leaving arrangements for carers to visit the property, AJ refused to cooperate, leaving her keys in the door so that the carers could not get in, and declining offers of personal assistance.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">At around this time, AJ was referred to social services by a psychiatric nurse. When a local authority case co-ordinator visited on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April 2013, Mrs. C raised the possibility of respite care for AJ to prevent the breakdown of the care arrangements. When the social worker visited again on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, Mrs. C told her that AJ was still refusing help, and had now developed a problem with swallowing. At that point, the case was transferred to another social worker, &#8220;Ms B&#8221;, a member of the early intervention service. When Ms B telephoned on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May, Mrs C told her she thought that AJ was no longer safe at home because she was not eating and drinking. She added, however, that AJ would not willingly go into a residential home. In her statement for these proceedings, Ms B says that she &#8220;discussed arranging a meeting to assess AJ with a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards assessor as it was apparent AJ, if placed in a care home for respite, may be considered as deprived of her liberty&#8221;. </p>

Mrs. C made it clear that she could not continue with her caring role in its current form as she and her husband had planned a fortnight&#8217;s holiday starting 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June. Mrs. C said that she now felt that permanent residential care was required. AJ was still not eating properly and had lost a lot of weight, and was continuing to resist offers of help. Mrs. C said she was exhausted in her caring role. Ms B offered to find the nearest suitable home for respite while Mr. and Mrs. C were away, and duly identified a home, X House, for that purpose. In her statement, she states: &#8220;it was hoped that if AJ settled she could remain in the care home on a permanent basis&#8221;.</p>

The urgent authorisation recorded inter alia that AJ had been placed at the home whilst her main carers, Mr. and Mrs. C, went on holiday for two weeks, &#8220;with a view to [AJ] staying here on a permanent basis&#8221;.

She also met AJ who told her that she was angry about the decision that she should be accommodated. She accepted that she would be &#8220;forced&#8221; to remain there while her niece and her husband were away, but said she expected to go home as soon as her niece returned from holiday. She said that she did not need the help of anyone else, asserting that she was independent and capable of looking after herself at home without any additional care or supervision, but added that Ms G should speak to Mr. and Mrs. C. </p>

Ms G therefore recommended the grant of a standard authorisation for a limited period of 21 days. In her statement for these proceedings, she explained that she had recommended this short period because of the uncertainty of the situation. Following this assessment, and on the basis of Ms G&#8217;s recommendation, the local authority on the same day, 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2013, granted a standard authorisation under Schedule A1 until 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2013.  The authorisation was subject to a condition that the managing authority under the Schedule (i.e. X House) should ensure that AJ&#8217;s care plan did not result in any additional unauthorised restrictions, should monitor and manage the restrictions currently in place, and notify the supervisory body under the Schedule (i.e. the local authority) of any changes to the care plan immediately with a request for a review. </p>

Those attending the meeting agreed that it was in AJ&#8217;s best interests to remain in care, but that she should move to another home &#8211; hereafter &#8220;Y House&#8221; &#8211; which was better suited for her needs. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">On 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, AJ moved to Y House where she has remained ever since. In preparation for a further best interests assessment, Ms G visited Y House on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July where she saw AJ who said &#8220;when can I go home &#8211; can you help me?&#8221; When told of the decision of Mr and Mrs. C that she should remain at Y House, she replied &#8220;bullshit, I will not, I am going home&#8221;. Ms G concluded that AJ objected strongly to the decision made for her and was able to articulate her feelings clearly. In her second assessment dated 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, Ms G confirmed that AJ was being deprived of her liberty, that the restrictions were necessary to prevent harm, that the care plan and restrictions on her liberty were in her best interests, and that the authorisation should be renewed for a period of six weeks. She completed a further &#8220;Selection of a Representative&#8221; form recording that the donees under the LPA had selected Mr. C to act as RPR, again confirming that he was eligible, and recommending his appointment. On the same date, the local authority as supervisory body renewed the standard authorisation until 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2013, on the basis of the same conditions as set out in the earlier authorisation. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Despite AJ&#8217;s known opposition to living at Y House, no legal challenge was made to the standard authorisations for several months. The reasons for this failure lie at the heart of this case.  The evidence clearly demonstrates that during this period there was no effective communication between Mr. C as RPR and Mr R, the IMCA. Mr. R first visited AJ on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2013,  and then spoke on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August to Ms G who was in the course of carrying out her third best interests assessment. According to the BIA, he told her that he had yet to make contact with Mr. C, whereupon she advised him that Mr. C was keen to discuss his role as RPR as soon as possible. Ms G and Mr. R then went to see AJ together on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August. After that meeting, according to Ms G, Mr. R said was unsure if he would pursue an appeal for AJ at that time. When she asked about this uncertainty, he replied that it was not uncommon for many older people in care to state a desire to return home and that judgments about any appeal were difficult for IMCAs when it is apparent that they need residential care. According to Ms G, however, Mr. R acknowledged that the strength of AJ&#8217;s objection indicated a need to pursue some action and that he would first wish to speak to Mr. C as RPR. In his evidence, Mr R could not recall saying he was &#8220;unsure&#8221; about pursuing an appeal, although he told the court that he was aware of inconsistency in patients&#8217; responses in these situations. After this, Mr. R was away on sick leave for some time and then on annual leave. He tried to contact Mr. C twice on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October and again on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November before finally succeeding in speaking to him on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November. It was Mr. C&#8217;s evidence that he wanted to speak to the IMCA, but Mr. R told the court that he was unaware that Mr. C was keen to speak to him. When they finally spoke, Mr. R realised that Mr. C was not going to initiate proceedings and after further conversations with his manager he agreed to act as her litigation friend and instruct solicitors to make an application to the Court on her behalf.</p>

It was asserted that (a) there was, judged objectively, a real risk that AJ would be deprived of her liberty from the outset of her stay at X House; (b) a DOLS authorisation or order from the Court of Protection should have been put in place prior to her move there, or alternatively as soon as possible after her arrival; (c) the local authority should not have appointed Mr C as the RPR  and should instead have appointed a paid RPR; (d) the local authority should have ensured that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.39</ref>D IMCA was able promptly to exercise his responsibilities under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, in particular by acting as litigation friend in s.21A proceedings; (e) had the local authority taken these steps, AJ would have been able to challenge the interference with her rights under Articles 5 and 8 of ECHR more swiftly; (f) in the alternative, the local authority should itself have issued proceedings in the Court of Protection. It was claimed that, by reason of the above failures, AJ&#8217;s rights under Article 5(4) were unlawfully violated for the whole or part of the period 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May to 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2013, and she was unlawfully deprived of her liberty between 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2013.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">On 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, Mr. R was replaced as litigation friend by the Official Solicitor. On 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, the local authority filed a defence denying the alleged breaches. On 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, Judge Tyzack transferred the case to me and I duly conducted a two-day hearing in Truro on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> and 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2014. Prior to the hearing, the Official Solicitor conceded that, in view of evidence as to a deterioration in AJ&#8217;s condition and behaviour, and to the fact that there was no domiciliary care agency willing to offer to provide care, it was no longer appropriate to put forward a positive case that she should return home so that the substantive application under s.21A could no longer be pursued. He added, however, that he had residual concerns about the type and degree of physical intervention being used, and that further investigation was required to ensure that this aspect of her care was expressly included in any standard authorisation or care plan approved by the Court when making an order concluding the s.21A application. In the circumstances, however, the principal issue remaining was the claim under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.7</ref> HRA. Here, too, the Official Solicitor indicated a change of position, indicating that no claim for damages would be pursued, confining the claim to a declaration and costs.</p>

Having heard oral submissions, I then adjourned to allow the parties an opportunity to file supplemental written submissions, and also the local authority to file evidence in the light of further assessments as to the care plan and, in particular, the details of the plan for physical intervention. This material was duly filed as directed by the end of June. By that stage, however, it was known that a case proceeding before the President (subsequently reported as <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re X and Others (Depravation of Liberty)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/25" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 25" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 25</ref>) would address a wide range of issues consequential upon the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">P v Cheshire West and Chester Council; P and Q v Surrey County Council</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2014/19" uk:canonical="[2014] UKSC 19" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] UKSC 19</ref> (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cheshire West</span>&#8221;)  and I concluded that it would be prudent to await the President&#8217;s judgment before reaching a final conclusion on the various issues that arise in this case. The supplemental material, and the further case law, gave rise to further questions which I put to the parties&#8217; advocates who duly replied in writing. </p>

I can deal with this issue briefly. A supplemental assessment by the BIA, Ms G, highlighted that the level of physical restraint being used by carers in Y House was greater than acknowledged in the care plan. Following the conclusion of the hearing, the residential home prepared an amended care plan for personal care interventions and indicated that it would record physical interventions in a daily physical intervention log at each personal care intervention. The revised plan does not include any specific reference to physical restraint being used, save that it is noted that, if AJ &#8220;starts to become physically aggressive the carers are required to adopt &#8216;walls and block&#8217; stance&#8221;. </p>

Furthermore, precise details of all physical interventions should be ascertained and documented as part of the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards process or indeed any best interest assessment from direct discussion with care staff implementing the interventions.</p>

These amendments include a new Schedule A1 which lays down in 188 paragraphs the provisions known as the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (&#8220;DOLS&#8221;) setting out inter alia (1) the procedure whereunder a supervisory body may authorise a deprivation of liberty, (&#8220;standard authorisation&#8221;); (2) the procedure whereunder the managing authority of a care home of hospital may authorise a deprivation of liberty for the period pending the grant of a standard authorisation (&#8220;urgent authorisation&#8221;); (3) the qualifying requirements for making authorisations; (4) procedures for carrying out of assessments to establish whether the requirements are satisfied, including an assessment by a best interests assessor (&#8220;BIA&#8221;); (5) a process for instigating and carrying out a review of a standard authorisation; (6) provisions concerning &#8220;relevant person&#8217;s representatives&#8221; (&#8220;RPRs&#8221;); and (7) provisions concerning independent mental capacity advocates (&#8220;IMCAs&#8221;).  For the purpose of this judgment, it is unnecessary to consider the majority of these provisions. Those relating to RPRs and IMCAs are considered below.</p>

Of relevance to this case is the President&#8217;s answer to the question whether P needs to be joined in the application to the court seeking authorisation of a deprivation of liberty and, if so, where there is a requirement that P must have a litigation friend.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">On behalf of the Official Solicitor representing AJ, Ms Butler-Cole submits that the local authority failed to comply with its obligations under Article 5 because the lawfulness of her deprivation of liberty was not brought before the court speedily. Counsel argues that the local authority should have sought a DOLS authorisation (or court order) authorising a deprivation of liberty on or around 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2013 when it was known that AJ was likely to be moved to a residential home against her wishes. The fact that the placement was a temporary one, for the ostensible purposes of respite, did not obviate the requirement for a DOLS assessment. The council&#8217;s failure to ensure that an authorisation was obtained before the period of deprivation of liberty started was contrary to the DOLS Code of Practice. Ms Butler-Cole relies in particular on the opening passage of Chapter 3 of the DOLS Code of Practice quoted above. In the vast majority of cases, it should be possible to plan in advance so that a standard authorisation can be obtained before the deprivation of liberty begins. It is only in exceptional cases, where the need for the deprivation of liberty is so urgent that it is in the best interests of the person for it to begin while the application is being considered, that a standard authorisation need not be sought before the deprivation begins. She submits that this was not such an exceptional case because the fact that a move was being contemplated was known to the local authority some weeks before it occurred. In this case, there was sufficient time for such an authorisation to be sought and obtained.  There was no &#8220;emergency&#8221; in the sense identified by the ECtHR in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">MH v UK</span>, supra, para 77(a). </p>

The local authority had commissioned the respite placement at X House having consulted with AJ&#8217;s family carers and considered the fact that they were authorised best interest decision-makers on account of their lasting power of attorney. The decision to provide interim support by way of respite was made by the local authority pursuant to its statutory duties under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/19/section/47/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.47(5)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/19" uk:canonical="1990 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990</ref> and not following any decision to place AJ in a care home placement. Upon AJ&#8217;s admission to X House, the managing authority had granted an urgent authorisation and the best interests assessor had subsequently completed the full assessment and recommended an standard authorisation for two weeks, and the appointment of Mr C as RPR.</p>

The local authority therefore knew that the move to X House was unlikely to be limited to the duration of the holiday. Furthermore, Mrs. C was completely open in telling the local authority that AJ would not move into any residential accommodation willingly. Following her telephone conversation with Mrs. C on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2013, Ms B spoke to a DOL assessor because, as she said in her statement, &#8220;it was apparent AJ, if placed in a care home for respite, may be considered as deprived of her liberty&#8221;. Accordingly, the local authority knew or ought to have known from 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May, or at the latest 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, that AJ would be admitted into a residential home from on or about 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June against her will in circumstances that were likely to amount to a deprivation of liberty. </p>

During the first few days of her stay at X House, there was no authorisation in place, nor was there an RPR or an IMCA appointed to support her. The fact that the first two weeks of her stay at X House were nominally labelled as &#8220;respite&#8221; care cannot justify the local authority&#8217;s failure either to instigate the DOLS process or apply to the court. The local authority plainly knew that Mr. and Mrs. C would not agree to AJ returning home at the end of their holiday and that, whatever may have been said about respite care, the move was intended to be permanent from the outset.</p>

In the alternative, given the fact that AJ&#8217;s objections to being placed in residential care were clear and well-known, the local authority could have applied straight to the Court of Protection without going through the authorisation procedure under Schedule A1. As Keehan J observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">NHS Trusts 1 and 2 v FG</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/30" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 30" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 30</ref> at paragraph 101(iii), &#8220;the mere fact that a deprivation of liberty could be authorised under Schedule A1 does not absolve [the authority] from making an application to the court where the facts would otherwise merit it&#8221;. </p>

The evidence, however, gives a slightly different picture. In her statement, Ms G explained that, when she had asked AJ who she would like to represent her, for example in an appeal to the Court, AJ had told her to speak to Mr. C. In her assessment, Mr. C met the statutory criteria for appointment, and appeared to have a good grasp of the role and responsibilities, including the need to keep in contact with AJ and to support and represent AJ in all matters relating to the DOLS.

He told me he understood the role, and also the conflict that he and others must face where the RPR&#8217;s wish to protect a loved one sits in incongruity with the relevant person&#8217;s wish for liberty. To support him as RPR, I suggested that in [this county] BIAs would automatically appoint an IMCA-39D [to] help in managing this tension. When I asked Mr. C if he would accept IMCA support, he readily agreed, telling me that this would be helpful to him.&#8221;</p>

According to Ms G, Mr. R did not raise any concerns or objections about the selection of Mr. C as RPR. He advised her that he was &#8216;not sure&#8217; if he would pursue any appeal for AJ at this time, stating that he would need to meet with AJ again to discuss her views and also to consult with her RPR. In an addendum statement, Ms G gave further detail about this conversation. When she asked Mr. R what he was uncertain about, he replied that it was not uncommon for many older people in care to state a desire to return home and that judgments about any appeal were difficult for IMCAs when it is apparent that the person requires residential care. According to Ms G, Mr. R then acknowledged that the strength of AJ&#8217;s objection indicated a need to pursue some action and that he would wish to speak to the RPR about this. When Ms G spoke to Mr. C again, he told her that his and his wife&#8217;s views were unchanged. He said he was still willing to act as RPR, although he had yet to speak to the IMCA and was keen to do so to discuss the support available to him in his role as RPR. </p>

Although [Mr. and Mrs C] absolutely agree to the right of an individual to challenge any deprivation of liberty, it would appear that bringing this case gave no consideration to the personal medical needs of AJ but rather based itself upon the view of an individual who had no knowledge of AJ and has visited her on only four occasions. Indeed, [Mr. and Mrs C] stated from the very outset that AJ would object to being in care but it would appear that these considerations were not given credence.&#8221;</p>

He said that he immediately recognised that there was a potential conflict of interest as he had been a party to the decision resulting in her placement in the home in her best interests.

In his statement, Mr. C said that no one told him that he should be seeking to issue an application for AJ notwithstanding her wish not to go through the court process, and that it never occurred to him to make an application against her wishes.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The Official Solicitor contends that the local authority as supervisory body ought not to have appointed Mr. C as RPR at all, or at least not without ensuring that he would bring proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/12/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.21</ref>A in the light of AJ&#8217;s known objections, or alternatively, having appointed him, replaced him when it became apparent that he was not going to facilitate a speedy review of her detention. The local authority, however, rejects these arguments, contending that it did all that could reasonably have been expected in appointing Mr. C to the role. Mr. Dooley submits that it was not open to the local authority as supervisory body to refuse to appoint Mr. C as RPR. He argues that, although the supervisory body appoints the RPR, its power to select the RPR is confined to the circumstances defined in regulation 9 &#8211; that is to say, it only arises if the RPR has not been selected under regulations 5 to 8 by the relevant person, or a donee under a LPA, or a deputy, or the BIA. Mr. Dooley submits that, if a RPR is selected under one of those regulations, the supervisory body is under a duty to appoint that person. In those circumstances, he contends that the decision to appoint Mr. C was one which the supervisory body was required to make by the statutory provisions.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">It is necessary, first, to consider the powers and duties of the BIA when selecting someone to act as RPR, and the powers and duties of the supervisory body in making the appointment. The interpretation of the complex provisions set out above have evolved in the course of initial written submissions, through oral submissions, supplemental written submissions and finally in answer to a specific question posed by me in writing as to the meaning of the word &#8220;eligible&#8221; in the RPR regulations.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The Official Solicitor submits that, in order for a person to be selected and appointed as RPR by the supervisory body, he or she must fulfil not only all the specific criteria set out in regulation 3(1) (a) to (h) of the RPR regulations but also meet the requirements set out in paragraph 140 of Schedule A1. When selecting the RPR, the person making the selection must be satisfied not only under regulation 3 that, as a matter of fact, the person under consideration is over 18, able to keep in contact with P, willing to act as P&#8217;s representative, not financially interested in P&#8217;s managing authority, nor a relative of someone so interested, nor (where as here, the managing authority is a care home) employed by or providing services to the managing authority, nor employed by the supervisory body in a role that is, or could be, related to P&#8217;s care. In addition, the person making the selection must, under paragraph 140 of the Schedule, make a judgment as to whether the person under consideration for appointment would maintain contact with P, represent P in matters relating to or connected with this Schedule, and support P in matters relating to or connected with this Schedule. Invited by the Court to define the meaning of the words &#8220;eligible&#8221; and &#8220;eligibility&#8221; in the regulations, the Official Solicitor argued that they encompass not only the factors listed in regulation 3 but also the requirements of paragraph 140. In support of this interpretation, Ms Butler-Cole drew attention to the terms of regulation 7(2) which stipulate that, where the BIA confirms the selected person&#8217;s eligibility, he or she must recommend that person for appointment to the supervisory body. As paragraph 140 provides that the selection must not be made unless it appears to the person making the selection that the prospective representative would comply with the requirements of that paragraph, those requirements must be included within the meaning of &#8220;eligibility&#8221; in regulation 7(2). </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Ms Butler-Cole points out that paragraph 140 is part of Schedule A1 itself and therefore part of primary legislation. Whoever is making the selection of the RPR, whether it be the BIA under regulation 8 or the supervisory body under regulation 9, (or indeed P himself under regulation 6 or a donee under an LPA under regulation 6) that person is bound by paragraph 140. Ms Butler-Cole interpreted the evidence as indicating that Ms G made the selection herself. She was not merely confirming Mr. C&#8217;s self-selection. Whoever was making the selection, whether it was Mr. C or Ms G herself, the intention behind regulations 7 and 8 is to ensure that the BIA provides an independent check on the proposed RPR, including by ensuring that the provisions of paragraph 140 of the Schedule are satisfied. </p>

There is no place in Article 5(4) for a best interests decision about the exercise of that right since that would potentially prevent the involvement of the court. The decision to exercise a right to bring proceedings cannot be a best interests decision. As Baroness Hale of Richmond observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cheshire West</span> (at paragraph 36), &#8220;the whole point about human rights is their universal character&#8221;.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"> In his response, Mr. Dooley on behalf of the local authority reminds me that &#8220;eligible&#8221; is defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary as &#8220;fit or entitled to be chosen for a position&#8221;. Paragraphs 142 to 146 of Schedule A1 to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> provide for regulations including the objective criteria for selection of RPRs and the local authority therefore submits that the eligibility criteria are those laid down in regulations 1 to 3 of the RPR regulations made under the statutory powers set out in those paragraphs. Mr Dooley submits that the provisions of paragraph 140 are not part of the eligibility criteria but, rather, require the person making the selection to make a judgment as to what the prospective RPR would do if appointed. These &#8220;expectations&#8221;, (as Mr. Dooley describes them), that the RPR will maintain contact with, represent and support P in matters relating to or connected with Schedule A1, are set out in general terms and, submits Mr. Dooley, reflect the intention of Parliament that the RPR should be a friend or relative prepared to assist P, rather than a professional.  Accordingly, Mr Dooley submits that Mr. C was &#8220;eligible&#8221; for selection and the donees were entitled to select him as RPR. The donees were the decision-maker as to selecting the person for appointment as the RPR.  Given the BIA&#8217;s capacity assessment, Mr. C took on the role of RPR in accordance with the Regulations, having regard to AJ&#8217;s expressed wishes</p>

Mr Dooley submits that this is reflected in the structure of the regulations, and in particular in the first sentence of paragraph 140.  It is submitted that when read in conjunction with the Regulations that sets out the selection process for the RPR and in the context of the legislator&#8217;s stated intention, the supervisory body&#8217;s decision to appoint Mr C as RPR following the best interests assessment was the decision it was required to make by the relevant statutory provision.</p>

There is nothing in the evidence to indicate whether or not she drew Mr and Mrs. C&#8217;s attention to the fact that, under regulation 6(1)(b), the donee under an LPA may select the RPR if the scope of the donee&#8217;s authority permits them to select a family member, friend or carer of P, including the donee himself or herself. Under regulation 8(2), the BIA may only make a selection in certain circumstances, namely where P has the capacity to make a selection under regulation 5(1) but does not wish to do so, or where P&#8217;s donee or deputy does not wish to make a selection under regulation 6(1) or (2), or where P lacks the capacity to make a selection and (i) does not have a donee or deputy, or (ii) has a donee or deputy but the donee&#8217;s or deputy&#8217;s scope of authority does not permit the selection of a representative. In this case, P lacked capacity to make a decision, and there is no evidence that Ms G asked Mr. C whether he wished to select the RPR, or that any consideration was given as to whether the scope of the donees&#8217; authority under the LPA executed by AJ permitted them to select the RPR. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Even if Ms G was entitled to select the RPR, she was in my judgment not entitled to select Mr. C because he was not eligible. Alternatively, if the reality is, as indicated on the face of the form headed &#8220;Selection of a Representative&#8221;, that the donees under the LPA (i.e. Mr. and Mrs. C) made the selection, Ms G when complying with regulation 7 ought to have refused to confirm that Mr. C was eligible. I accept the Official Solicitor&#8217;s submissions as to the meaning of &#8220;eligible&#8221; and &#8220;eligibility&#8221; in the regulations. In my judgment, they encompass the requirements not only of regulation 3 but also of paragraph 140 of Schedule A1. I acknowledge that paragraphs 7.7 to 7.9 of the DOLS Code of Practice refers to the regulation 3 factors as the eligibility criteria. But Paragraph 140, which is a statutory provision, is in mandatory terms. The selection must not be made unless it appears to the person making it that the prospective RPR would maintain contact with P and would represent and support P in matters relating to the Schedule. I am not persuaded by Mr. Dooley&#8217;s characterisation of the provisions of paragraph 140 as setting out &#8220;expectations&#8221;. In my judgment, they are part of the eligibility criteria.</p>

Of particular relevance for this case, it is not enough for the person making the selection to be satisfied, as required by regulation 3(1)(c), that the person under consideration is &#8220;willing to be the relevant person&#8217;s representative&#8221;.

As he frankly said in his statement as quoted above, his &#8220;reasons for not assisting the appellant to exercise her right to review by the court was because he was aware of the complete background to the case, the extensive medical professional involvement and the outcome of a multi-disciplinary best interests meeting; the conclusions of all being that AJ required significant care despite her likely objection.&#8221; I accept Mr. C&#8217;s evidence that he immediately recognised that there was a potential conflict of interest as he had been a party to the decision resulting in AJ&#8217;s placement in the home because he considered this to be in her best interests. I accept his evidence that he raised this at the outset and that in response Ms G indicted that she would immediately arrange for the appointment of an IMCA.

The European and domestic case law make it clear that there is a positive duty on public authorities under the Convention to ensure that a person deprived of liberty is not only entitled but enabled to have the lawfulness of his detention reviewed speedily by a court, to ensure that a mentally incapacitated adult is afforded independent representation, enabling them to have their Convention complaints examined before a court or other independent body, and not to permit access to a court to be dependent on the exercise of discretion by a third party who supports the deprivation of liberty. As the President has made clear in of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re X and Others (Deprivation of Liberty)</span> [2014], it is not always necessary for P to be joined as a party to any proceedings, but the state is under a clear duty to ensure that he or she is able to challenge a deprivation of liberty in a process that is judicial, accessible and independent of the detaining authority. To my mind, these obligations impose on the local authority as supervisory body a duty to scrutinise the prospective RPR selected under regulations 5 to 8 before making the appointment. I do not accept Mr. Dooley&#8217;s submission that it was not open to the local authority as supervisory body to refuse to appoint Mr. C as RPR. The fact that, under regulation 11, a supervisory body may not (except where regulation 9 applies) appoint a RPR unless the person is recommended by a BIA under regulation 7 or 8 does not mean that it is obliged to appoint a person who is so recommended. Where a supervisory body has reason to believe that the person selected as RPR will not comply with the obligations under paragraph 140 of the Schedule, its duties under Article 5 compel it to refer the matter back to the BIA.</p>

The local authority ought to have known that Mr. C, given his firm view that a residential placement would be in her best interests, would have difficulty representing and supporting AJ in matters relating to or connected with Schedule A1, specifically in connection with any review of or challenge to an authorisation granted under the Schedule.</p>

European and domestic case law make it clear that an applicant is not required, as a precondition of enjoying the protection of Article 5, to show that on the facts of her case she stands any particular chance of success in obtaining his release: <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Waite v UK</span>, supra, para 59. As Ms Butler-Cole puts it, Article 5(4) gives AJ an unqualified right of access to the court so there is no place in Article 5(4) for a best interests decision about the exercise of that right since that would potentially prevent the involvement of the court when, in Baroness Hale&#8217;s words, &#8220;the whole point about human rights is their universal character&#8221;.

The guidance in the DOLS Code of Practice suggests that the obligation to monitor the performance of the RPR falls on the managing authority of the residential home. This does not, however, obviate the need for the supervisory body to satisfy itself that the RPR is eligible to be the RPR prior to appointment, and once appointed remains eligible throughout the term of the appointment.</p>

Even if, however, it was not under an obligation to appoint an IMCA, the Official Solicitor submits that the local authority should have nevertheless taken steps to assist AJ in exercising her rights. He further submits that, having rightly or wrongly appointed an IMCA, it remained under an obligation to monitor how the IMCA was acting in furtherance of those rights, and should have ensured that funds were available to enable the IMCA to obtain legal advice and act as litigation friend</p>

The fact that he had failed to do so was not the responsibility of the local authority.</p>

(1) In what circumstances does the duty to appoint an IMCA under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 39</ref>D arise?

She submitted that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 39</ref>D IMCAs are not solely concerned with the exercise of &#8220;relevant rights&#8221; (as defined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 39</ref>D(10)), although all <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 39</ref>D IMCAs have an express duty to support P and the RPR to exercise these relevant rights.

However, Ms Butler-Cole stressed that the decision whether to exercise the relevant right on P&#8217;s behalf is not a best interests decision, since it would not be consistent with the European jurisprudence for access to the court under Article 5(4) to be dependent on a substituted best interests decision. </p>

I can find no reference to the interpretation of the amended section 40 in the voluminous guidance set out in either the MCA Code of Practice or the DOLS Code of Practice. The MCA Code, which gives considerable guidance on the scope and interpretation of the original provisions concerning IMCAs in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 37</ref> to 39, has not been amended to give any guidance as to the interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 39</ref>A to E and, so far as I can see, the DOLS Code does not address the issues under consideration here.

The amendment ensures that there will still be a duty to instruct an IMCA (for health and social care issues) for someone who lacks capacity even if they have someone to represent them on different issues, for example financial issues.

The exercise of those rights concerning the deprivation of liberty is not a decision relating to welfare. I accept Ms Butler-Cole&#8217;s submission that the statutory provisions and individual instruments must be interpreted in a way which is compatible with ECHR. If Parliament had intended that the scope of a health and welfare LPA should extend to the decisions concerning the exercise of relevant rights within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 39</ref>D(10), I would have expected this to be expressly stated in the statute.

For reasons that are not clear to me, the terminology used on the form does not reflect the language of the statutory provisions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 39</ref>D(5). The supervisory body is not under an obligation to appoint an IMCA simply because it believes that P and/or the RPR will &#8220;benefit from the support of an advocate&#8221;. The obligation only arises where the supervisory body has reason to believe (a) that <span class="legaddition5" style="color:#000000">without the help of an advocate, P and R would be unable to exercise one or both of the relevant rights or (b) that P and R have each failed to exercise a relevant right when it would have been reasonable to exercise it, or (c) that P and R are each unlikely to exercise a relevant right when it would be reasonable to exercise it. The reasons why the standard form is drafted as it is were not canvassed in the hearing, but might usefully be considered by the Court of Protection Rules Committee. Be that as it may, the evidence showed that AJ and Mr. C were each unlikely to exercise a relevant right when it would be reasonable to exercise it (AJ because she lacked capacity, Mr. C because he believed that it was in AJ&#8217;s best interests to be in residential care.)

In fairness to him, as I have already mentioned, he was off sick for a time in the Autumn 2013. Mr. R said that he was aware that part of his role as an IMCA is to discuss with P their rights, including the right to appeal against a standard authorisation. He said, however, that he and his colleagues had been &#8220;consistently told&#8221; by their managers that they could not act as litigation friends. Consequently there was, he said, no clarity as to how to take matters forward and IMCAs are often in a quandary about what to do in such circumstances. It was the local authority&#8217;s case, however, that at all material times funds were available to assist in the appointment of a litigation friend. In cross-examination, Mr. R conceded that he had not made inquiries of the local authority to establish whether additional funds would be made available in this case to assist in the appointment of a litigation friend. </p>

Ms Butler-Cole submitted that it was ultimately the local authority&#8217;s responsibility to ensure that AJ&#8217;s rights under Article 5(4) were not breached. Accordingly, the local authority should have either required the RPR or the IMCA to issue proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/12/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 21</ref>A or, failing that, issued proceedings itself.

Mr. Dooley further submitted, however, that, having appointed an IMCA, the local authority was under no further duty to take steps to ensure that AJ&#8217;s relevant rights were exercised. He submitted that the fact that the IMCA had not facilitated any application to the court before November 2013 was not the responsibility of the supervisory body who imposed no restrictions on the work of IMCAs and had funds available in appropriate cases to meet additional costs incurred, for example in acting as a litigation friend. Furthermore, he submitted that there is no duty placed upon the supervisory body to challenge a standard authorization in the statutory scheme. He conceded that this may have been a step taken in other cases, but in this case, having appointed a RPR and an IMCA to support AJ, the local authority was under no such obligation. On behalf of the local authority, he expressed regret about the delays in bringing the matter before the court but submitted that those delays were the result of a combination of mischances rather than any failure on the part of the local authority to uphold AJ&#8217;s Article 5 rights. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">The principal errors committed by the local authority in this case were, as analysed above, the failure to initiate the authorization process prior to the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2013 and wrongly appointing Mr. C to act as RPR. In my judgment, however, the local authority&#8217;s obligations did not stop there. The local authority thought that it would be meeting its obligations by appointing an IMCA and making resources available to assist the IMCA to act as litigation friend. As set out above, the appointment of an IMCA under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/39" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 39</ref>D was entirely appropriate and, although Mr. C was uncertain about how to take matters forward, I accept the local authority&#8217;s case that resources were in fact available, for example to assist an IMCA acting as litigation friend. In most cases, that would in all probability have been sufficient. In this case, however, the local authority knew that Mr. C was unwilling or at least very reluctant to represent or support AJ in challenging the authorisation because he and his wife had concluded that they could no longer safely look after her at home and he believed that it was in her best interests to live in residential care. In those circumstances, I find that the appointment of Mr. R and the provision of resources to assist him in his role as IMCA did not absolve the local authority from its continuing obligation to ensure that AJ&#8217;s rights under Article 5(4) were respected. The local authority knew at all times that AJ did not wish to be in X House or Y House. In those circumstances, I consider that the local authority, in addition to monitoring the actions of Mr. C as RPR and taking steps to replace him if appropriate, should have made enquiries as to why the IMCA was not taking steps to ensure that the right to apply to the court was being exercised. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in">As a last resort, the local authority should have considered bringing proceedings before the court itself. Plainly this is a last resort, because of the comprehensive and complex provisions for the selection and appointment of RPRs and the appointment of IMCAs are followed, and if RPRs and IMCAs appointed under these provisions carry out their responsibilities as they should, the rights of an incapacitated person to challenge a deprivation of liberty normally will be protected. But the local authority remained under a continuing and positive obligation to ensure that AJ&#8217;s Article 5(4) rights were respected. Thus, if it was not satisfied that the IMCA was taking the necessary steps to apply to the court, and if in all the circumstances it considered such a course to be appropriate, it should have brought court proceedings itself. In this case, however, it is likely that an inquiry of Mr. R by the local authority into the steps he was proposing to take would have clarified the position and led him to initiate proceedings at an earlier stage. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Mr. Dooley assures me that this local authority, which is generally recognised as taking its responsibilities to elderly and vulnerable people extremely seriously, has taken on board the lessons of this case. I accept his assurance. There are, however, a number of wider lessons for practitioners arising from this litigation.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">First, I emphasise that the scheme of the DOLS is that, in the vast majority of cases, it should be possible to plan in advance so that a standard authorisation can be obtained before the deprivation of liberty begins. It is only in exceptional cases, where the need for the deprivation of liberty is so urgent that it is in the best interests of the person for it to begin while the application is being considered, that a standard authorisation need not be sought before the deprivation begins.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Thirdly, a RPR should only be selected or confirmed by a BIA where he or she satisfies not only the criteria in regulation 3 of the Mental Capacity (Deprivation of Liberty: Appointment of Relevant Person&#8217;s Representative) Regulations 2008 but also the requirements of paragraph 140 of Schedule A1 of the MCA. This requires that the BIA not only checks that the facts set out in regulation 3 are satisfied but also carries out an analysis and reaches a judgment as to whether the prospective representative would, if appointed, (a) maintain contact with the relevant person; (b) represent the relevant person in matters relating to or connected with the Schedule and (c) support the relevant person in matters relating to or connected with the Schedule.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Fourthly, the local authority is under an obligation to satisfy itself that a person selected for appointment as RPR meets the criteria in regulation 3 and in paragraph 140 of Schedule A1. If the local authority concludes that the person selected for appointment does not meet the criteria, it should refer the matter back to the BIA. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Fifthly, it is likely to be difficult for a close relative or friend who believes that it is in P&#8217;s best interests to move into residential care, and has been actively involved in arranging such a move, into a placement that involves a deprivation of liberty, to fulfil the functions of RPR, which involve making a challenge to any authorisation of that deprivation. BIAs and local authorities should therefore scrutinise very carefully the selection and appointment of RPRs in circumstances which are likely to give rise to this potential conflict of interest.</p>

Failure to do so will lead to the evaporation of P&#8217;s Article 5 rights. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Seventhly, the appointment of a RPR and IMCA does not absolve the local authority from responsibility for ensuring that P&#8217;s Article 5 rights are respected. The local authority must monitor whether the RPR is representing and supporting P in accordance with the duty under paragraph 140 and, if not, consider terminating his appointment on the grounds that he is no longer eligible. The local authority must make sufficient resources available to assist an IMCA and keep in touch with the IMCA to ensure that all reasonable steps are being taken to pursue P&#8217;s Article 5 rights. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Finally, in circumstances where a RPR and an IMCA have failed to take sufficient steps to challenge the authorisation, the local authority should consider bringing the matter before the court itself. This is likely, however, to be a last resort since in most cases P&#8217;s Article 5 rights should be protected by the combined efforts of a properly selected and appointed RPR and an IMCA carrying out their duties with appropriate expedition. </p>
