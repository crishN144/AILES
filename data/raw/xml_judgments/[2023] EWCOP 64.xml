	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When the proceedings were issued in December 2021 the local authority sought orders that would give them permission to access X&#8217;s home to clear the clutter that had been hoarded, carry out repairs and monitor the situation going forwards. Some two years on, despite strenuous and creative attempts by the local authority, X&#8217;s legal team and the court to bring about any change the position largely remains the same. As a consequence, the local authority sought orders that would, in effect, remove X from her home to enable the necessary work to be undertaken due to the level of risk to X and the unlikelihood of any change in the position that would avoid such an order being sought. X strongly resists such an order and, as a consequence, the Official Solicitor was neutral in relation to the order sought by the local authority.</p>

She would not let anyone access her home and was herself effectively confined there, meaning that she could not attend the community health team base for therapy. Input from mental health services was therefore limited to supportive visits and monitoring&#8230;.She has also found it extremely difficult to get rid of any belongings, meaning that over the years she has amassed many items that fill her property. For this reason she had not felt able to allow anyone enter her home for many years. In the last year this has led to something of a crisis in her conditions, following the local authority advising her that they would need to gain access to her property to carry out repairs. She is particularly concerned that they may insist on disposing of some of her belongings which would cause her acute distress&#8217;.</span></p>

They were not given access to all the property but their conclusions include that the hoarding is at the level of 8/9, it poses a significant risk to X, a fire risk to X and her neighbours, any clearing will be a very slow process and the clearance plan should not be implemented in its current form as it risks X&#8217;s mental health and makes no mention of addressing the psychological reasons for X&#8217;s hoarding. AB considered that a client centred psychological approach is essential to minimise distress and promote X&#8217;s autonomy.</p>

He submits they have developed a contingency plan following wide consultation in order to achieve this, with a heavy focus on seeking to engage and work with X. In the event that is not possible then in a wholly supported way, ultimately with the use of restraint, for her to be removed from her flat.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He relies on the reports from Dr Z where he concludes that X&#8217;s ability to weigh the relevant information is impaired due to the symptoms of her mental disorder, namely severe OCD and Hoarding Disorder. X has a compulsion to buy items that is beyond her conscious control and not amenable to being weighed in the balance against other relevant information and that the result of her resisting that compulsion would be overwhelming anxiety. Mr Harrop Griffiths submits that whilst X may be able to understand and retain certain information, she is unable to use or weigh it due to pathological avoidance of the anxiety that drives her behaviour. As a consequence, her anxiety renders her unable to use or weigh the information that she needs support and that she needs to be away from her flat while it is provided. This view, he submits, is supported by the evidence of Ms G.</p>

The evidence, he submits, demonstrates that this can only be done with X living elsewhere and not being able to return to the flat whilst that is done. The local authority seeks orders that X is taken to an appropriate supported living placement and for an order to be made depriving her of her liberty there to prevent her returning to her flat until the necessary work has been done. The local authority recognises that the order it seeks interferes with X&#8217;s Article 8 rights to respect for her private life and home but submit such orders are justified and proportionate bearing in mind the risks to X, such orders being necessary for the protection of her health and only for a temporary period.</p>

X has repeatedly told professionals she wants support, so understands her need for it at that level but is not able to make use of the support. So, submits Ms Nizami, X is not able to use and weigh that information to a sufficient level that would enable her to engage with the support that is offered. As Ms G notes in her capacity assessment <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230;even though she was aware of the instructions from the court and had previously agreed to the plan with [AB], she was unable to use and weigh up the relevant information and fully understand the consequences of her decision not to engage in the support being offered. [X&#8217;s] compulsive purchasing of items result in excessive hoarding within her home, which has meant she has been unable to maintain a habitable home due to the volume of accumulated personal belongings, and refusal of entry for relevant professionals to provide support for her to manage her hoarding behaviour and items. Her entrenched and irrational belief system prevents her from agreeing for her landlords to carry out necessary safety inspections or maintenance works in the interests of her own health and safety or engage with professionals to declutter her home&#8217;.</span></p>

X has lived in the property for many years and any removal from the property is likely to cause X significant distress. X has consistently objected to any plan that would separate her from her property and possessions. In his most recent report, Dr Z noted regarding his conversation with X that he asked how she would feel about not being present whilst the property was cleared and states in his report that &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">She said the idea was &#8216;inhumane&#8217; and would feel &#8216;worse than being burgled&#8217;.

As the proposed plan has not been tried before Dr Z stated <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230;it is not possible to know whether [X] would in fact become actively suicidal were the contingency plan to be carried out, however I agree with [Dr T&#8217;s] view that this risk needs to be taken seriously given the very likely high levels of distress that will accompany any clearance of her belongings&#8217;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Against these strong factors it is necessary to weigh in the balance the significant risks to X of remaining in the property without any change. The risks to her come from a number of different directions. The risk of fire was assessed over 2 years ago as substantial, there is nothing to suggest in the evidence that has changed. The assessment in 2022 was that the hoarding level was at 8/9, very nearly the highest level. Whilst there was a some limited change in the hall and stairway, as demonstrated by the photographs. It was only a marginal change and it is very likely the level remains at the same high number as so graphically illustrated in the photographs in the papers. This means that in addition to the fire risk, the risk to X  of tripping or falling, of the emergency services, if required, being unable to get to her, remain significant. This applies in the context of what X describes about her continuing health difficulties and the need to attend medical appointments that may, in due course, require treatment at home. The condition of the property interferes with X&#8217;s every-day living, again resulting in further risks for X.  In addition, there are the inherent risks to her of the property having been left for years without any proper maintenance. Overall, in my judgment, the continuing risks to X remain very high if no steps are taken to remove the clutter from her home.</p>

The local authority have shown considerable resourcefulness in trying to find a way to help support X to take the necessary steps to bring about real change to the circumstances which she lives in. The local authority, together with the medical and mental health professionals, have been patient, creative and resilient in what have been the very challenging circumstances they have had to manage over a number of years. Despite the steps taken, with appropriate support for X, the situation has remained largely unchanged. In my judgment, there is no basis for any further delay to try another organisation which is very likely to fail, as others have done. The action required to remove the clutter from the home can only take place in the absence of X.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The move proposed in the clearance plan is for a limited period of time with a plan that enables X to return to her property, once the works required have been undertaken. The proposed supported living placement is not far from X&#8217;s home. It will provide for X&#8217;s privacy as she will have her own bedroom, bathroom and cooking facilities and X will have access to additional support. The plan involves AB who know X and understand the importance X attaches to her possessions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The detail in the contingency plan provides for a multi-disciplinary staged approach with the focus very much on seeking X&#8217;s co-operation with appropriate specialist support available. Much of the detailed discussions relating to the plan has been done in collaboration with the Official Solicitor, in the event that the court did grant the order. It is right to acknowledge that it does, in the event of no co-operation from X, provide for restraint to remove X from the premises that is proportionately and appropriately overseen by mental health and medical practitioners.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having stood back and looked at the wide canvas of evidence,  the court is really faced with a binary best interest choice. Either X remains in the property with no prospect of any change which is very likely to get worse, in a situation that is described as being a significant fire risk to her, along with the many other risks outlined above, or steps are taken to seek to bring about change. However, this latter course is not without its own risks bearing in mind X&#8217;s very strongly held wishes, the very high level of distress she is likely to experience, her threats of suicide, which need to be taken seriously, and the significant interference in her Article 8 rights that such a move entails. There is no middle ground that has any credible evidence to support it; based on past experience any further attempt to support X to bring about changed is certain to fail.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have reached the conclusion that X&#8217;s best interest are served by the local authority application being granted. In doing so I readily accept the considerable risks that are being taken in overriding X&#8217;s expressed wishes and the consequences for her of such a step being taken, bearing in mind her mental disorder and the suicide threats she has made. Those matters weigh heavily in the balance. Having said that, I consider the balance is tipped the other way by what I regard as the substantial and increasing risks X would be left exposed to if this order was not granted. They are serious risks that would have a direct impact on X&#8217;s health and safety. There is no prospect of any other step being taken that would bring about out any meaningful change. The evidence set out in the detailed contingency plan includes provision that would seek to mitigate the impact on X of what is proposed by the multi-disciplinary approach, where X would have the continuing involvement and support of the Official Solicitor and a hearing to review the next steps by the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In approving the steps outlined in the contingency plan it will also mean that X&#8217;s best interests will be served by an order that deprives X of her liberty in the temporary supported accommodation she will move to. That order will ensure the main purpose of the order, to clear X&#8217;s flat, takes place with the aim of enabling X to return to the property.</p>
