Having read her statement and listened to her in the witness box, I fully accept the mother&#8217;s evidence on this point. I have no doubt that she is genuinely fearful of the father and that this fear has circumscribed her life, and that of her daughter, for the last fourteen years. Her anxiety was evident throughout the hearing, and in particular on two occasions &#8211; when describing to me in outline what the father had done by way of incitement to murder her on the second occasion and, secondly, when it became apparent in the course of Miss Willbourne cross examination, through the production of recent photographs obtained by or on behalf of the father, that he is, or may well be, aware of her current location. </p>

I have for as long as possible tried to avoid being found by [the father]. I need to be around to raise my child. Nothing is normal. I may not be the same person as I was then. Work becomes incredibly difficult. In terms of living arrangements you have to change as many things as you can. You are not open with people when you make friends. On a day to day basis you live in fear. When a car stops outside that you don&#8217;t expect, the instant reaction is &#8211; &#8220;is it a bad person?&#8221; &#8220;do I need to run?&#8221; you learn to live with that, but it is always there.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As before, the court process has been impeded by the fact that the father is incarcerated in prison in Australia. Efforts at exploring the possibility of establishing a video or telephone link have been unsuccessful. These difficulties arose in the earlier proceedings when under schedule 1 and, as a result, I took steps to ensure that counsel then instructed on Mr P&#8217;s behalf had an opportunity to take instructions on the evidence given (as described in paragraph 51 of the judgment.) In this case, a further complication arose because the father was no longer represented. I record, therefore, that to ensure that he had had a fair opportunity to put his case, I gave directions for the service of a bundle prepared for the hearing on the father, and subsequently adjourned the hearing of this application, originally listed on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2014, to ensure that he had a fair and proper opportunity to prepare a skeleton argument setting out his response. The father has subsequently filed a full skeleton argument, and supporting documentation, and from those documents, and the various emails to the court sent by him (via his former solicitor) I conclude that he has indeed seen the full bundle and furthermore that he has had a fair opportunity to put his case. </p>

In other words the case raises the question of whether the inherent jurisdiction in relation to adults can be exercised for the protection of vulnerable adults who do not, as such, lack capacity. In my judgment, the jurisdiction can be so exercised. And I propose to exercise the jurisdiction in this particular case, so that a young woman who remains just as vulnerable now she is an adult as she did when she was still a child, should not be suddenly deprived of the protection which the court has hitherto felt it necessary to afford her and which I believe is still very much required in her best interests.&#8221;</p>

The origins of wardship lie in the parens patriae role of the Crown. In the exercise of parental responsibility generally, decisions are often taken for the benefit of young people that extend into adulthood. In most cases, parents &#8211; and the court &#8211; stand back to allow young people to make decisions for themselves. In some cases, however, young people need continuing help and protection beyond their 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthdays.

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">This principle is reflected in the dicta of Munby J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re SA</span> quoted above. Although dealing with a different set of circumstances &#8211; the need to protect a young woman from the risk of an unsuitable arranged marriage &#8211; the learned judge was careful to stress that there is probably no theoretical limit to the jurisdiction and (citing Singer J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re SK</span>, supra) observed that the jurisdiction must evolve in accordance with social needs and social values. In my judgment, the jurisdiction extends to protect vulnerable young people whether or not they lack capacity. Since the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re SA</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">,</span> society has increasingly recognised that there are many young people who for one reason or another are in need of protection beyond their 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday. Cases of sexual exploitation are but one example. There are, of course, statutory remedies available in many cases, but the inherent jurisdiction is also available to provide protection where appropriate. As Munby J observed in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re SA</span> at paragraph 2 in the passage already quoted, </p>

The court is a public authority and, when exercising its jurisdiction in wardship and under the inherent jurisdiction, must have regard to Articles 2, 6, and 8 when making orders that are needed to protect young people falling within its jurisdiction.</p>

That is sufficient to provide jurisdiction in this case for the making of the orders sought by the applicant. In addition, the court may have jurisdiction on the grounds that the ward is a British national. In either case, the question is, as Baroness Hale observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re A</span> whether it is appropriate to exercise the jurisdiction in the particular circumstances of the case. </p>

He further submits that Australia is the appropriate forum on the grounds that all parties are living there. On this point, however, I accept the submission of Mr Lyon that to require either S or the mother to make an application in Australia exposes both of them to the very risks which this court&#8217;s orders have been designed and intended to avoid. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Having regard to the history, and the evidence I heard during the last hearing as quoted from my 2014 judgment, I am in no doubt that this mother, and indirectly S, remain at very great risk from the man who has twice been convicted of offences involving the incitement to murder the mother, the second conviction relating to an offence committed while he was in prison in Australia and the mother was on the other side of the world in the United Kingdom. The revelation in the course of the hearing in 2014 that the father had obtained photographs that indicated he may be aware of the location of the address of the mother and S has been confirmed by his skeleton argument for this hearing. Although to date the direct threat has been towards the mother, it is in my judgment plain that S remains at risk of emotional harm as a result of that threat. I completely reject the father&#8217;s reassertion of the argument, made repeatedly in proceedings in this court and in Australia, that he has been motivated solely by a wish to protect S. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, it is imperative that this court makes the order within the wardship jurisdiction, or alternatively under its inherent jurisdiction to protect vulnerable adults, extending the protection provided hitherto beyond S&#8217;s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday. In the circumstances of this case, it is essential that, in order to ensure the protection is extended for S, the mother is also kept within the ambit of the injunction. </p>

I have made some slight amendments to the draft order submitted by Mr Lyon, in part to address a further complaint by the father who objected to the inclusion of a provision preventing him from going within 100 miles of any place where the applicant or S may be living or staying. Mr P objected that such an order would be varied for uncertainty because, unless it is known where S is residing, such an exclusion zone could not be fairly defined. I therefore make an order in the following terms:</p>
