He was born in 2018 to Jonathan, his father, and Claire, his mother.  Throughout this judgment, I will refer to the mother and father in those respective roles and by those titles.  I do so for ease and continuity of reference.  I mean no disrespect to either of the parents.  This is my judgment at the conclusion of a finding-of-fact hearing within the father&#8217;s application for a spend time with order.  </span></p>

The proceedings have been case-managed by the magistrates from the outset following the receipt of safeguarding.  The safeguarding letter identified the need for a finding-of-fact hearing and, thus, this hearing was directed.  The matter came before Recorder Norman for directions and the matter listed, originally, in June and July 2022.  That hearing was adjourned due to judicial availability and the matter re-listed before me.  This hearing has taken place as a finding-of-fact hearing via CVP over two days.  </span></p>

Matthew is the only child of the parents although Matthew has a step-sibling, an older child, Robert, who is the son of the mother.  The parties began a relationship in 2015 and, at that time, the father was living in India.  They married and the family relocated to this country.  The child, Matthew, was born in the summer of 2018 and, in 2019, the relationship between the parents ended.  I note, however, that that date is contentious and I will come to that in due course.  </span></p>

The allegations are ones of physical and emotional abuse and they are serious in their nature and character, particularly, the conduct of the father post-separation.  The mother contends in seven pleaded specific allegations that over a period of about four years, the father behaved in a way towards her that is abusive.  The father, as he said in his submissions, denies each and every allegation and has sought to explain his behaviour insofar as there is agreement between the parties about some of the incidents but, effectively, says that that is not abusive behaviour and, therefore, Matthew&#8217;s welfare is not, in any way, compromised.</span></p>

The burden of proving an allegation rests with the person making it. The person on the end of an allegation does not have to prove anything.  The standard or proof in the Family Court is the simple balance of probabilities.  In other words, the court must ask itself whether it is more likely than not that the event occurred.  This principle must be applied with common sense.</span></p>

There is no room for finding that it might have happened.  The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1.  The fact either happened or it did not.  If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof.  If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened.  If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened.&#8221; </span></p>

If the lie was for an innocent reason, namely one that does not denote guilt, it may be ignored.  However, if the lie was not told for an innocent reason, it may be used to support the truth of the allegations, if there is other supporting evidence, per R v Lucas [1981] QB 720.</span></p>

That application was not pursued by Mr Walker on behalf of the mother who had sought to file evidence from two family friends and a former friend in the church.  I say it was not pursued because the last time this matter came before the Court on 8 November 2021 before Recorder Norman, the learned recorder made a direction that any additional third-party witness statements sought to be relied upon should be filed by 6&#160;December 2021.  </span></p>

Again, this was filed some six months after the deadline set by Recorder Norman and, therefore, I did not admit the statement into evidence.  However, in respect of all the statements, I, of course, had the discretion under FPR 22.1 to allow evidence if it is probative.  In my view, the statements that all of the parties sought to file were not probative to the allegations made by the mother, firstly, because in respect of the statement of Violet Smith, there was a significant number of original source text messages and Facebook messages exhibited by the parents that dealt with her involvement in the things said and done.  Accordingly, additional evidence from her, in my view was otiose.</span></p>

All those witnesses, effectively, were providing hearsay which, when I have the evidence of both parents, in my view, was of diminished importance but also widened the issues.  That, in my view, was not conducive to concluding this case in a proportionate way and would have led, in my view, to significant distraction from the issues at heart.  In addition, there was an issue with the grandparents&#8217; statement because, of course, it made a number of retaliatory allegations against the mother.  I was particularly concerned about this given the context of the messages to Violet Smith exhibited by both the father and the mother when it was clear that the involvement of the paternal family in the marriage became in issue.  I, therefore, did not see how that evidence could be safely admitted and relied upon.  Accordingly, in the end, I considered evidence from the father in terms of the statements he has filed and from the mother in terms of the statement she has filed both in these proceedings and, indeed, in the proceedings for an injunction.</span></p>

This is particularly important to be done where the father represents himself and wishes to directly challenge the mother&#8217;s evidence.  As it happened, as I attempted to do this as a housekeeping issue at the start of this hearing, the father indicated he had no wish to cross-examine the mother and would rather give his own evidence.  I considered that to be a reasonable position and that was not objected to by Mr Walker.  </span></p>

However, I did give the father an opportunity, after the end of the mother&#8217;s evidence, to consider any questions he would like to be asked and to send those to me through his clerk.  Therefore, there was some cross-examination on behalf of the father but that was ventilated through me with, effectively, the judicial filter being put on it to make sure that that cross-examination was measured, appropriate and did not realise the fear, and policy reason behind the prohibiting of cross-examination which is, of course, to prevent the process itself being used in a way that is abusive.</span></p>

I say that because where I have two competing versions of events and where I have little in the way of contemporaneous evidence, although I will come back to the contemporaneous evidence shortly, the Court must have recourse to other sources of evidence including the nature of, or any agreed facts between the parties, the context of events and allegations and, of course, contemporaneous evidence.  It seems to me that the context in this case was so contentious that it, itself, required some determination.</span></p>

I gleaned from his evidence that he persisted with the belief that the relationship would be salvageable even when it would not be up to that point.  In cross-examination, the father was asked about going to see the mother over the time between 2019 when the mother says the parties separated, and spring 2021, when the father says that he chose to separate, finally.  He was asked if he went to threaten her.  He said:</span></p>

In my view, the relationship ended in 2019 and the father pressured her to continue the relationship under the guise of &#8220;sorting things out&#8221;.  The father has exhibited Facebook Messenger messages to his latest statement of a conversation between him and Violet, a friend from the church, in 2019.  These begged for Violet&#8217;s intervention as &#8220;She&#8230;&#8221;, the mother, &#8220;&#8230;will only listen to you&#8221;.  It is obvious that the mother is making noises that the relationship is over and the father&#8217;s response, tellingly, is to ask for intervention and proposes even getting an evening job to stay out of the way.  Violet&#8217;s analysis of the situation was to explain that the mother was experiencing a tough time and that the mother finds the intervention of the paternal grandparents difficult.  Even in these cherry-picked messages from the father, the father&#8217;s attitude of non-acceptance in the face of being told the reality by Violet, shines through.  </span></p>

Upon coming to the UK and being expected to support a family, it is, in my view, inherently likely that the father would have struggled with the adjustment of caring for a child and working long hours.  It is obvious that the effect was to cause the father to sour.  He did so publicly, in a Facebook post in March 2021, describing, &#8220;My ex-wife is a typical bitch, not letting me meet my son for over one week&#8221;, calling it &#8220;a toxic relationship to gain attention and sympathy just because I refuse to do what she wants&#8221;.</span></p>

He also described &#8220;losing the full support of the respondent in February 2021&#8221;.  He said this upset him for some time.  It is obvious that the father resented the mother for the situation he found himself in.  The father told me that the abusive Facebook post was a &#8220;one-off&#8221;.

I find that it was completely concordant with my impression of the father in May 2021, acting destructively, laced with spite towards the mother.  I am satisfied that, by this time, the father had lost control of his emotions and behaviour.  In spite of recognising, in evidence, that the social media post was hurtful, he offered no satisfactory reason as to why he would choose to do this as a one-off, and I do not believe that it was.  I consider that the social media post, on the contrary, epitomised the father&#8217;s attitude towards the mother around that time.  The context of the ultimate end of the relationship, in my view, holds the key to understanding the allegations that the mother has made and the likelihood in terms of Father&#8217;s behaviour.  </span></p>

He began to speak about her in a publicly vitriolic way.  The father wrongly blamed the mother for his presentation and declining state of emotional health and the father had lost insight into his destructive behaviour.  My preliminary findings, in my view, set out the essential background to this case which runs through Mother&#8217;s allegations and events as if it were a golden thread.</span></p>

In his evidence, the father described a miserable existence involving hard work over long hours and many jobs.  He told me he often worked from 6.00am until 10.00pm.  He told me he had to do to support his family.  He described sometimes working on rotation, meaning that this life was inconsistent.  He would sometimes work in the afternoons and sometimes overnights.  He described having, prior to moving to the UK, few caring responsibilities.  He had free time and the luxury of choice but described his UK life as a sharp contrast.  He described the mother as being, from 2017, heavily pregnant, unable to work.  He said there was little time to do anything for himself and that this was a big lifestyle change.  </span></p>

His insight into his own behaviour and his ability to look back reflectively and accurately describe that behaviour is not, in my judgment, of a level that I can trust to be reliable and I, therefore, prefer the evidence of the mother.  The mother, in my view, has provided threads of evidence in respect of this that I consider to be clear and compelling and have the ring of truth.  I am fortified in this impression by the consistency that she has provided in both her written and her oral evidence.  I am satisfied, on balance, that this allegation is, therefore, made out.  I, therefore, find that the father would, from time to time, take out his frustrations on the mother.  He would physically push her during arguments and abuse her with language such as &#8220;evil&#8221;, &#8220;dirty&#8221; and &#8220;rubbish mother&#8221;.</span></p>

The father told me that they shared food and would spend quality time together.  The mother, in her statement, described a different aspect of the relationship between the father and Robert, however, which involved conflict and jealousy.  I am not asked to make findings in relation to the relationship between Father and Robert but it seems, certainly, that the father&#8217;s relationship with Robert was complex and, perhaps, not as rosy as the father had explained in his evidence.  </span></p>

Fifth, his ability to regulate his emotions was poor and, sixth, he had a small two-door, four-seater car.

He said he was cross with Robert because he would not turn up YouTube to distract Matthew, his only response, in cross-examination, that he has never lifted a finger to him.  However, of course, this is not the allegation.  I find it to be inherently unlikely that the father would remember such a mundane event so vividly unless something else did, indeed, occur.  I weigh these factors together: the context, the agreed facts, the febrile home environment that the father was living in.  Like in 2018, I am entirely satisfied that this spilled over into the physical.  On the evidence I have considered and the evidence I have, I find this to be inherently likely.  I find that in 2019, the father lost his temper with Matthew.  He admonished Robert for not helping him with the distressed Matthew and threw a carrier bag at Robert.</span></p>

Likewise, I have made findings about the father&#8217;s disinhibited and gradually more irrational behaviour.  It is obvious to me from the Facebook post I have seen and the evidence I have heard, including from the father, that the father has, by this point, lost control of his behaviour.  I have found and explained my reasons why I consider the father&#8217;s behaviour, at this time, had worsened.  I found he was unable to accurately recall and describe his behaviour at that time.  I have no faith if the father had behaved like this, that he would have the ability to recognise it and describe it, firstly, accurately and, secondly, as any way problematic.</span></p>

There was, in my view, a sm&#246;rg&#229;sbord of feelings from anger to resentment to contrition, and back to anger and resentment.  These feelings and the feeling that Matthew was being taken from him, in my judgment, provide a clear but toxic behaviour drivers for the incident that Mother, at the time, is describing.  I am not going to engage as to the question of whether the father, at this time, was suffering a mental health crisis and whether, indeed, this influenced his behaviour.  He has, fundamentally, not produced any medical evidence as directed and all I have is his self-reported social media post, formulated on the basis of a helpline.  I am sceptical as to whether or not this was for show as, certainly, the truth as the father described it, did not amount to a diagnosis of mental health emergency from a mental health team as he was trying to give the impression.</span></p>

He split hairs in evidence about whether this amounted to &#8220;demanding&#8221; but he effectively describes several occasions where he attended the mother&#8217;s address as an unwelcome visit, attracting her attention by knocking on the windows and insisting on seeing Matthew.  He conceded that he did that in forthright terms but would not depart from his recognition of that as anything other than insisting; the father exercising the right he perceives him to have, as Matthew&#8217;s father.  There are striking similarities in what the father, eventually, conceded and what the mother described.  I accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that he was unwelcome and that she would try and dissuade him, following the well-documented advice of Aunt Violet and that the father was, ultimately, persistent.  This persistence, in my view, would have, in all likelihood, spilled to physical force and protestation.  The father&#8217;s persistence, by that time, knew no bounds.  </span></p>

He described that he was &#8220;distraught and upset&#8221;.  He told me he wanted to work things out and he hoped it would, too.  He was clearly incapable of thinking straight and it is obvious that this will have affected his behaviour.  This only fortifies my view that he was persistent to a wholly inappropriate degree on these occasions. </span></p>

The evidence from the father and the context of events concords with the mother&#8217;s evidence.  I find that in March 2021, the father, first, threatened the mother over the telephone, including a threat to chop her into pieces, second, called the mother on a withheld number when it was not wanted.  He would turn up at her house and demand to come in.  When he was not welcome, he would knock on the windows and try to attract the mother&#8217;s attention.  Third, on one occasion, the father attended the mother&#8217;s address and knocked on the windows.  When the mother closed the curtains, he tried to grab her arm.</span></p>
