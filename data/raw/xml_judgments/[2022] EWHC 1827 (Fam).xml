The applicant K is, as now confirmed by DNA testing, the father of P.  He is represented by Ms Maggie Jones of Counsel. The respondent, N is P&#8217;s mother.

The mother resists the application on a single ground, namely that the father did not have rights of custody in respect of P for the purposes of Art 3 of the 1980 Convention at the time the mother removed P from the jurisdiction of the Republic of Ireland.  Within that context, the mother contends that the removal of P from the jurisdiction of Ireland was not wrongful.  The mother does not dispute that P was habitually resident in the jurisdiction of Ireland at the time she was removed to the jurisdiction of England and Wales.</p>

Mr Healy gave oral evidence to the court and was cross-examined.  At this hearing, the court further admitted a statement from the applicant&#8217;s brother, detailing what he says was an encounter with the mother in Ireland some days after the date she claims to have left that jurisdiction and a letter from the father&#8217;s solicitors in Ireland that was produced by the father today.  The court has also been assisted by a Position Statement prepared by Ms Jones on behalf of the father.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother contends that the relationship with the father was characterised by domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour.  Whilst in her statement the mother does not particularise her allegation of domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour, relying on a short letter from a women&#8217;s refuge evidencing their involvement, she does make a specific allegation of sexual assault against the father on 1 January 2020.   In her statement, the mother suggests that P was conceived as a result of this assault although, following the issue of proceedings by the father, the mother also asserted that P was not the father&#8217;s child.  DNA testing has since established that B is the father of P.  The father emphatically denies ever having been domestically abusive to the mother or having engaged in coercive and controlling behaviour.  He categorically denies having sexually assaulted the mother on 1 January 2020.  The mother confirmed through Ms Pascoe at this hearing that she does not seek to rely on the exception to summary return provided by Art 13b of the 1980 Convention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both parents concede that their relationship cooled after the mother became pregnant and the father was not present for the birth of P.   The mother contends in her first statement that the relationship ended on 10 February 2020, the date she contends she took P to England.  The father contends that he provided financial support to the mother and P before and after P&#8217;s birth.  This is disputed by the mother.  The father further contends that he had regular contact with P on a weekly basis between September and October 2020, after which the mother refused to permit him access to P.  As a result of this development, the father&#8217;s solicitors wrote to the mother on 2 February 2021 indicating that the father sought joint guardianship, custody and access to P and sought to negotiate the same.  Having received no response from the mother, the father made an application to the Irish Court for an order conferring on him legal guardianship for P.  In light of the issue that has arisen in respect of the existence or otherwise of rights of custody, it is important to examine the course of those proceedings in a little detail.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father issued his notice of application for relief under s.11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, seeking directions concerning P and appointment as a joint legal guardian, on 9 February 2021, with a return date of 8 March 2021.  An attempt was made to serve the mother with this notice of application by way of pre-paid post but the letter was returned as &#8220;not called for&#8221;.  Within this context, the father made a without notice application to the Longford District Court.  The District Court heard that application on 8 March 2021 and made an order for substituted service by ordinary prepaid post to the respondent&#8217;s Longford address, with a return date of 12 April for hearing of the substantive application under the 1964 Act.  The original notice of application dated 9 February 2021 was endorsed on 8 March 2021 to reflect the order made on that date.  Within this context, Mr Healy confirms, in line with the documents before this court, that the date of service of the notice of application was 12 March 2021.  The Irish Court granted legal guardianship to the father on 12 April 2021, the mother having not attended the court.  Following that decision, the father attempted to contact the mother but without success.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing procedural context, the mother contends in her evidence before this court that she moved to the jurisdiction of England and Wales with P on 10 February 2021.  Her statement exhibits a copy of an e-ticket dated 4 February 2021 for travel between Dublin and Holyhead on 10 February 2021.  The father exhibits to his statement an email from the letting agents responsible for the property that the mother was renting with the maternal grandmother prior to her leaving for England.  That email states that the keys to the property were surrendered on the weekend of 7 March 2021.  The father relies on this evidence to support his contention that the mother did not leave Ireland with P until 7 March 2021.  In her second statement (made following the exhibition of the email from the letting agent to the father&#8217;s first statement) the mother asserted that the maternal grandmother had in fact remained in Ireland until 7 March 2021.   To her statement she exhibits the maternal grandmother&#8217;s booking confirmation for travel to England on 7 March 2021.  The court also now has before it a statement from the father&#8217;s brother.  In that statement, the father&#8217;s brother contends that he saw the mother in Ireland on 6 March 2021.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application before this court was issued on 8 February 2022, although the father had approached the Irish Central Authority in October 2021 and the application to the Irish Central Authority is dated 29 November 2021.   Following the father&#8217;s application to this court, the mother was located in England pursuant to a location order made by Theis J on 14 February 2022.  The mother attended a hearing before Morgan J on 25 February 2022 and the time for the filing and serving her response to the application was extended to 4 March 2022.  Following a further extension, the mother filed and served her response on 8 March 2022.  In light of the contents of that response, on 11 March 2022 Mostyn J gave directions for expert evidence on Irish law.  As I have already noted, the expert evidence in this case has been provided by Mr John Healy SC.  Mr Healy was asked to answer, and has answered, the following questions in his expert report:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When seeking to apply Art 3 and Art 5 of the 1980 Convention in a domestic context, it is important to recall that the term &#8216;rights of custody&#8217; falls to be given its autonomous meaning under the 1980 Convention.  Within this context, when the English court is faced with determining whether rights of custody existed at the time of the removal or retention, an important distinction must be drawn between the question of what rights, if any, a parent has under the domestic law of the requesting State and the question of whether those rights amount to rights of custody for the purposes of Art 3 of the 1980 Convention.  In this context, Dyson LJ (As he then was) drew the following distinction in <span style="font-style:italic">Hunter v Murrow (Abduction: Rights of Custody) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 1119" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 1119</ref>:</p>

As Ward LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re V-B (Abduction: Custody Rights)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 FLR 192" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 FLR 192</ref>, at 196B, the first task is to establish what rights, if any, the applicant had under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before his or her removal or retention.  I shall refer to this as 'the domestic law question'.  This question is determined in accordance with the domestic law of that State. It involves deciding what rights are recognised by that law, not how those rights are characterised. As Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR said in <span style="font-style:italic">C v C (Abduction: Rights of Custody)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1989] 1 WLR 654" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1989">[1989] 1 WLR 654</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1989] 1 FLR 403" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1989">[1989] 1 FLR 403</ref>, at 663F and 413 respectively: 'it matters not in the least how those rights are described in Australian law. What matters is whether those rights fall within the Convention definition of &#8220;rights of custody&#8221;'. To similar effect, Millett LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re F (P Minor) (Child Abduction: Rights of Custody Abroad</span>) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] Fam 224" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] Fam 224</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 31" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 31</ref>, at 235 and 40F respectively, that the Colorado lawyers should not have been asked 'whether the appellant's conduct in removing the child from Colorado was wrongful by the law of Colorado, whether at the time of the child's removal the respondent had what a Colorado court would describe as &#8220;rights of custody&#8221; or whether the child's removal would be regarded by a Colorado court as being in breach of those rights'. The only question which the Colorado lawyers should have been asked was what rights, if any, were possessed by the applicant in relation to the child at the time of his removal from Colorado.</p>

I shall refer to this as 'the Convention question'. This is a matter of international law and depends on the application of the autonomous meaning of the phrase 'rights of custody'. Where, as in the present case, an application is made in the courts of England and Wales, the autonomous meaning is determined in accordance with English law as the law of the court whose jurisdiction has been invoked under the Convention. But as Lord Browne-Wilkinson said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Abduction: Acquiescence)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] AC 72" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] AC 72</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 1 FLR 872" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 1 FLR 872</ref>, at 87F and 882 respectively, the Hague Convention cannot be construed differently in different jurisdictions: it must have the same meaning and effect under the laws of all Contracting States.

An assertion that the removal of a child is wrongful within the meaning of Art 3 entails three propositions, viz: (i) the applicant enjoys certain rights in relation to the child; (ii) these rights are 'rights of custody' within the meaning of the Convention; so that (iii) the removal of the child is in breach of those rights and therefore wrongful.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">[49] The first proposition raises the domestic law question. In many cases this question is satisfactorily resolved on the basis of expert evidence; or in reliance on a certificate or affidavit under Art 8(f) 'emanating from a Central Authority, or other competent authority of the State of the child's habitual residence, or from a qualified person, concerning the relevant law of that State'; or by taking notice 'directly of the law of, and judicial or administrative decisions, formally recognised or not in the state of habitual residence of the child, without recourse to the specific procedures for the proof of that law or the recognition of foreign decisions which would otherwise be applicable' (see Art 14).</p>

Such a request was made in the present case. Hedley J made a consent order that the father obtain from a court of competent jurisdiction in New Zealand 'a description of any rights in relation to the said child enjoyed by the father'. The decision of a court of competent jurisdiction is, obviously, more authoritative on the domestic law question than the opinion of an expert. In some circumstances, it is preferable to obtain a court ruling. But delay is inimical to the best interests of the child. The present case demonstrates that there may be a price to pay for seeking an authoritative ruling under Art 15. It is reasonable to believe that the domestic law question could have been determined earlier in the present case if it had been resolved by the courts of this country without invoking Art 15. I hasten to say that I intend no criticism of the New Zealand courts which heard and decided the case and the appeal with commendable speed. But recourse to Art 15 will usually involve delay.</p>

These will include (i) the nature of the dispute raised by the question, (ii) whether the parties intend to adduce evidence from experts who appear to be suitably qualified to express an opinion on the issues raised by the dispute, (iii) whether the question can be satisfactorily answered on the basis of Arts 8(f) or 14, and (iv) what delay is likely to be caused by the request.

The child was habitually resident in Western Australia and was removed by his mother to the UK. The father issued an originating summons in Western Australia and the judge made an order vesting sole custody rights in the father and declared that the removal of the child was wrongful within the meaning of Art 3 of the Hague Convention. The father then issued proceedings in this country for the return of the child. It was held by the courts of this country that the removal was not wrongful. Although no order had been made pursuant to Art 15, Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR referred to that Article and said at 568D and 446 respectively:</p>

It cannot, as I see it, have been the intention that the courts of the other Contracting State should be asked to determine the issue of the applicability of Art 3 insofar as it turns on the meaning of the Convention itself, because that is something which the courts of both countries are equally able to determine. Indeed, they would be expected to arrive at similar determinations. If, unhappily, this did not occur, the court which is being asked to order the return of the child would be bound to apply its own view of the Convention, particularly where, as here, the Convention only takes effect by virtue of a domestic Act of Parliament.</p>

The judge's views on Western Australia law I, of course, accept unreservedly.

In saying this, the appellate judge is not paying deference to the decision of the judge below in the public law sense, or allowing a margin of appreciation in the sense explained in the Strasbourg jurisprudence, or according latitude to a person who is exercising a discretion. He is merely saying: 'this is an experienced judge whose views must always be taken seriously, but in my view on this occasion he is wrong'.</p>

The courts of New Zealand are no better placed than the courts of this country to decide whether the rights enjoyed by the applicant in relation to the child according to New Zealand domestic law amount to rights of custody within the autonomous meaning of Arts 3 and 5 of the Hague Convention. It is regrettable, but perhaps inevitable, that there are divergences of view as to the international meaning of concepts such as 'rights of custody' and 'rights of access'. The present case illustrates this only too vividly, and shows why there is no point in obtaining a ruling on the Convention question.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have noted, the mother contends in her first statement that she moved to the jurisdiction of England and Wales with P on 10 February 2021, relying on an e-ticket dated 4 February 2021 for travel between Dublin and Holyhead on 10 February 2021.  That ticket was booked at 1.28pm on 4 February 2021 (two days after the mother was written to by the father&#8217;s solicitors indicating he was seeking joint guardianship, custody and access to P).  The ticket indicates that one adult and one child were travelling and gives the registration number of the car that is the subject of the reservation.  To her second statement the mother exhibits the receipt for that booking, which lists the passengers as herself and P.  The mother also exhibits to her second statement a copy of the boarding pass dated 10 February 2021 for two passengers and one vehicle.  In response to the father&#8217;s assertion that an email dated 15 March 2021 from the letting agents responsible for the property that the mother was renting with the maternal grandmother stating that they keys to the property were surrendered on the weekend of 7 March 2021, the mother contends that the maternal grandmother remained in the property alone until that date.  To her second statement the mother exhibits a further e-ticket for travel between Dublin and Holyhead on 7 March 2021 for one passenger and a car with a different registration number listed on the e-ticket for 10 February 2021.  The document lists the maternal grandmother as the subject of the booking.  The email from the letting agents does not relate who returned the keys on weekend of 7 March 2021.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Assessing the available evidence in a manner commensurate with the summary nature of these proceedings, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the mother departed the Republic of Ireland with P on the afternoon of 10 February 2021 as indicated by the boarding pass. The reservation for 10 February 2021 is for one adult and one child, supporting the contention that the mother and maternal grandmother travelled on different dates.  This conclusion is reinforced in circumstances where the receipt for the ticket for 10 February 2021 lists only the mother and P as passengers.  The return of the keys on weekend of 7 March 2021 is consistent with the maternal grandmother departing Ireland separate from the mother, as indicated by the separate e-ticket for one passenger on 7 March 2021 which contains the maternal grandmother&#8217;s name.  Whilst the court has before it a statement from the father&#8217;s brother in which the father&#8217;s brother contends that he saw the mother in Ireland on 6 March 2021, I am satisfied that I can attach little weight to that statement.  The sighting alleged by the father&#8217;s brother is entirely inconsistent with the clear documentary evidence before the court and the statement was provided very late and only after the departure date of the mother became an issue in the case.</p>

As to when such rights might become attributed to the Irish court, Mr Healy relates that in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">T v O</span> the Supreme Court of Ireland suggested that such attributed rights would arise as at the return date of the application made to the court.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the expert evidence before the court, there are a number of difficulties in this case with the proposition that the lodging of the notice of application dated 9 February 2021 acted to attribute rights to District Court that the father could enforce.  First, there is no definitive Irish case law establishing that such a step is capable of attributing rights to the Irish court that are thereafter enforceable by the father, the suggestion that it <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> have that effect<span style="font-style:italic"/>deriving from an <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> comment at first instance.   Within that context, and at its highest, the expert evidence before the court is that a notice of application <span style="font-style:italic">may </span>have the effect of attributing rights to the Irish court <span style="font-style:italic">if </span>it was lodged with the court. On that latter point, and perhaps more fundamentally on the facts of this case, it is far from clear whether the notice of application was lodged with the court and, if so, whether it was lodged with the court prior to 10 February 2021.  The father has adduced no evidence to demonstrate this was the case.  In the circumstances, whilst the fact that the notice of application is addressed to the District Court Clerk might, as a matter if logic, suggest that the notice was lodged,  there is no evidence to confirm this in fact occurred and that it occurred before the mother departed the jurisdiction with P on the afternoon of 10 February 2021.  </p>

Applying the criteria articulated by the United Kingdom Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K (Abduction: Inchoate Rights) </span>I am not satisfied that the father has demonstrated that he had inchoate rights of custody immediately before 10 February 2021.</p>

She had not abandoned P nor had she delegated the primary care of P to the father.  Whilst the father had the right to apply for guardianship under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, there was at 10 February 2022 no legal or official recognition of the father&#8217;s care for P nor, in the circumstances, could there have been where the father was not undertaking the responsibilities entailed in the primary care of P.</p>
