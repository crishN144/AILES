He was the subject of a late but, as it turned out, correct diagnosis of autism and mild learning disability.  This resulted in his needs remaining unmet during his schooling.  He also has a visual impairment and he has spent time compulsorily detained under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.

He lives in a house with another resident and their day-to-day care is provided by a private agency.  PWK made it clear to me that he is happy, both with where he lives and the general quality of care that he receives.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The package of support, which includes two-to-one supervision, undoubtedly involves a deprivation of liberty.  If PWK has the requisite capacity then, of course, he can consent to that deprivation.  If, however, he does not have that capacity, then his deprivation of liberty needs to be authorised.  His present accommodation is not a care home so the statutory scheme under Schedule A1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> does not apply.  This deprivation of liberty requires the authorisation of the Court under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 16</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>.  Accordingly, questions as to his capacity arise.  A finding that PWK lacks the relevant capacity is the only gateway which allows the Court to make best interest decisions and to grant authorisations.  That is so even where, as here, there are no realistic alternatives to what is provided and the person concerned is in fact content with the arrangements. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The applicant Local Authority seeks declarations of incapacity in six areas: first, where to reside; secondly, care and support needs; thirdly, contact with others; fourthly, social media and the internet; fifthly, financial and property affairs; and lastly, use or possession of his car provided by the Motability scheme. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It is common ground that these issues should be determined, though the Official Solicitor, on behalf of PWK, queries whether the question of the car should be separately determined and also invites attention to the fact that in relation to some matters, for example where to reside, PWK, in reality, has no choice. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Apart from hearing PWK twice during the trial, each time at my invitation, I also heard evidence from the social worker, Mr Sean McDonagh.  He conveyed a warm concern for PWK and a desire to work with him.  This is generally reciprocated, though the social worker is the inevitable butt of any conflict that PWK has with the Local Authority at any particular time.  That said, I am satisfied that he understands and is committed to acting in the best interests of PWK. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I also heard from Dr Lisa Rippon, a consultant psychiatrist approved under Section 12(2) of the Mental Act 1983.  Until Dr Rippon&#8217;s involvement this year, it had always been the common view of those involved that PWK lacked capacity in each relevant area.  In her earlier reports, Dr Rippon challenged this view.  However, having had the opportunity to consider all the information in the case, in her third report dated 10 April 2019, she revised her views and found that he lacked the relevant capacities.  Inevitably, her views had to be explored with some care and, given the inherent complexity of the case, it was listed before a tier-three Judge. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The question arose as to how the legal position on capacity should be addressed in these circumstances.  Whenever the question of capacity arises, the Court should start with a consideration of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Sections 1</ref> to 3 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.  The Court should avoid glossing <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> but should stick to its wording.  It is essential to remember that under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1(2)</ref> there is a presumption of capacity which anyone seeking to challenge it, here the Local Authority, must do so by establishing incapacity on the balance of probabilities.  By <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1(4)</ref>, it may not seek to infer incapacity from the taking of unwise decisions.  By Section 2(1) it is clear that capacity is a decision-specific concept.  Moreover, it has a mental component.  It provides: </p>

There are, as it seems to me, two potential difficulties with that approach.  The first is the question of whether the statute actually permits the making of a declaration in those terms.  The second is that there is the practical problem of how those responsible for PWK&#8217;s care could in fact operate such a declaration on the ground.  It is not, of course, my place to say that this decision was wrong in the circumstances of that case, but I do believe that PWK&#8217;s case requires a rather different perspective. </p>

In so finding I acknowledge, as I have done in relation to the other matters, that there would be times when a snapshot of his condition would reveal an ability to manage his affairs.  But the general concept of managing affairs is an ongoing act and, therefore, quite unlike the specific act of making a will or making an enduring power of attorney. The management of affairs relates to a continuous state of affairs whose demands may be unpredictable and may occasionally be urgent. In the context of the evidence that I have, I am not satisfied that he has capacity to manage his affairs.&#8217;  </p>

Because of his visual impairment he cannot drive it and is dependent on others to do so.  For understandable reasons, which do not require recitation in Court, his care providers will not authorise their staff to drive it.  It is, therefore, unused and may indeed on that basis be repossessed by Motability.   Family members have varying views about the car. </p>

It is a good illustration of </p>

Ordinarily I would accede to the view that this was simply a component of the care package and ought to be treated as such.  In the unusual circumstances of this case, however, I have decided that it should receive individual consideration. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">As I have said, PWK is a man with multiple disadvantages but who can and does function remarkably well within the constraints of his care package.  Dr Rippon was clearly impressed by his abilities to think and express himself in interview, as I was by his ability to handle himself in Court.  Yet there is another side to the picture when PWK is overwhelmed by anxiety and speaks and behaves in a way he rapidly comes to regret.  That anxiety is often but not always predictable and is liable to affect every part of his life and not just the issue of the moment, whatever that may be.  It is the unpredictability of that anxiety and the seriousness and breadth of its impact which is decisive in this case in overturning the legal presumption of capacity.  Although its effect is principally in Section 3(1)(c), it does often extend to the earlier matters too.  It is, in applying a longitudinal perspective to this,that highlights the incapacity. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">For the reasons that already appear sufficiently in this judgment, I am satisfied that PWK lacks capacity to conduct these proceedings to determine his residence or care or his contact with others or his management of his own affairs.  It is not appropriate for me to give detailed directions under this head under Section 4.  It is enough to say that the detailed care package provided under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/117" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 117</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> is, as it seems to me, entirely in his best interests and that it is further both proportionate and in his best interests to deprive him of his liberty to the extent implicit in that package.  The details are matters to be worked out on the ground on the basis of decisions made in accordance with Section 4 by those responsible for his care. </p>

In my judgment, it is correct to make a separate determination in this case as well.  I am satisfied, again applying a longitudinal perspective, that PWK lacks capacity in this area.  Just as PWK is undoubtedly able to make choices as to what he wears or what he eats, so he will be able to make many choices in this area, but not all and in particular he lacks the ability to make judgments about what is actually harmful as opposed to merely unpleasant and some judgments will simply have to made for him.  Again, I think it both unwise and unnecessary to say more for all the indications are that these matters can be negotiated and resolved on the ground. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The car is a controversial matter.  However, three things are clear: first, that PWK cannot drive it himself; secondly, no one can compel an unwilling carer to drive it for him; and thirdly, no one has attempted to assert a right to drive in the face opposition from the care providers.  However, possession of the car and access to it and use of it, even whilst stationary, have proved to be controversial.  As I say, matters relating to this wholly dominated PWK&#8217;s written observations and in particular his second address to me. </p>

I am not convinced that he is always able to retain all the necessary information.  However, I am amply satisfied that, because of the acute anxiety that this subject generates in him, he is unable to use and weigh that information as part of the decision-making process. </p>

As the effect is to authorise a deprivation of liberty, this should now be the subject of at least annual review.  This case can now be returned to the experienced District Judge who earlier had the conduct of it.  It should be a matter for the parties, who have independent rights to apply to the Court, and the Judge to determine when and how it is reviewed so long as the period does not exceed 12 months. </p>
