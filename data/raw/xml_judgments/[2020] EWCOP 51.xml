She is presently living in Ireland, having moved there in September 2018. Prior to that move, she had been resident in Kent for over 55 years. If, as the Applicant contended, IM remained habitually resident in this jurisdiction, then issues as to her health and welfare were matters for the Court of Protection. If she was now habitually resident in Ireland as both Respondents contended, then such matters would fall within the jurisdiction of the High Court in Ireland. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It appears that, in June 2019, the HSE proposed the appointment of a personal welfare deputy for IM. It made its concerns about her welfare known to the OPG and to the interim property and affairs deputy appointed by the court. The HSE also filed reports with the court on 22 November 2019 stating its view that IM should return to England.  By an order dated 4 November 2019, the HSE were invited to attend a hearing on 25 November 2019 when the court noted that one of the issues to be addressed at that hearing was IM&#8217;s habitual residence. The HSE attended court on 25 November 2019 but had not been told the hearing had already been vacated. This happened on 18 November 2019, the OPG having applied to withdraw the proceedings on 12 November 2019. The court concurred with that request on the papers and vacated the hearing on 25 November 2019 without apparent reference to the HSE&#8217;s concerns or the earlier direction that IM&#8217;s habitual residence remained in issue.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Prior to September 2018 IM lived on the ground floor of a property in Kent and, despite her considerable age, was able to look after herself and go to the shops without assistance. The upper floor of the property appears to have been occupied by VS and his successive partners. According to NS, VS&#8217;s sister, he appears to have lived with IM on and off since he was about 15 years old though VS told IM&#8217;s solicitor that he had lived with IM for about 15 years. It is, however, beyond doubt that VS provided practical and other assistance to IM from time to time and it is reasonable to infer that the demands on him as her informal carer probably increased over time. IM&#8217;s GP records contained many references to IM receiving support from VS as did the records from the Enablement at Home Service in 2017.  IM also had other relatives living in Kent including NS, but her relationship with them seems to have been more at arm&#8217;s length. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There were conflicting accounts of IM&#8217;s relationship with VS. NS described a toxic and abusive relationship in which VS moved into IM&#8217;s property and of IM being &#8220;too scared&#8221; to do anything about it. She stated that VS&#8217;s then girlfriend used IM&#8217;s bank card to take money from IM and alleged that VS and his partner also agreed with a builder to overcharge IM for work done on the roof of her property. A statement apparently made in connection with non-molestation proceedings in 2010 between NS and VS stated that, after Christmas 2009, IM broke down in tears on the telephone and told NS that VS had taken &#163;6,000 from her. NS had encouraged IM to get VS to move out and believed that IM was scared of VS. From about 2013 NS had had several telephone calls with IM in which IM described VS &#8220;going berserk at her&#8221; and said that living with him was &#8220;like mental torture&#8221;. In January 2013, a safeguarding alert was raised by Kent County Council following an allegation from NS that VS had taken money and a bank card from IM but, surprisingly, no further action was taken. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is important to note that none of these allegations have been put to VS and he has filed no evidence in these proceedings. The relationship between him and NS is clearly very poor indeed. By contrast, his former partner, SFC, told the OPG that IM doted on VS though she did confirm that his behaviour could be unreliable, volatile, and erratic. She told the Official Solicitor in May 2020 that VS had been very close to IM and had helped with her medication, hospital appointments, shopping, and other matters. She confirmed that IM would not have chosen to move to Ireland herself but would have gone along with what VS wanted as she relied on him. On the contrary, IM used to talk about remaining in her home and spoke about family buried in the local cemetery. I note that another relative, FS, described VS as doting on and worrying about his grandmother. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In May 2017, IM then aged 88, was referred to her local memory clinic due to concerns about cognitive deterioration. IM&#8217;s disclosed medical records make no further reference to any action being taken as a follow-up to that referral. Coincidentally, in May 2017, Lasting Powers of Attorney [&#8220;LPAs&#8221;] for Property and Affairs and for Health and Welfare were executed in favour of IM&#8217;s grandson, VS and his then partner, SFC. The LPAs were registered in July 2017. In July 2018, presumably consequent on the breakdown of VS and SFC&#8217;s relationship, a partial deed of revocation was made, removing SFC as attorney and leaving VS as sole attorney. IM engaged a solicitor to act in those matters and there were no concerns raised as to her capacity. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In November 2017, IM was admitted to hospital after a fall. She was assessed as having the capacity to make the decision about her discharge home with a package of reablement care. On 18 February 2018, IM was the subject of an over-75s well person assessment. The assessment report expressly recorded that there were no concerns about IM&#8217;s memory. It also recorded that IM knew what her medication was for. I note that she had a diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. In May 2018, IM was once more assessed, but no concerns were recorded about her mental capacity. She was further assessed for chest pain by ambulance staff on 17 August 2018 who expressed no worries about her mental health. She was then seen in the Accident and Emergency Department of the local hospital and there was no record of IM being confused or mentally impaired at that time.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">However, in May 2018 it appears that IM was having frequent urinary tract infections and was struggling to manage her medication due to apparent confusion. In July 2018 three months of medication was requested from the pharmacy as IM was said to be going on holiday. Another prescription was requested in November 2018, but there was no-one at IM&#8217;s home when it was delivered. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In Spring/Summer 2018, IM told another relative, FS, about a move to Ireland and the plan for her to live there with VS and AM (VS&#8217;s new partner). When contacted by the Official Solicitor in May 2020, FS described IM as being quite happy with the proposed move. On 23 July 2018, IM told her GP about a proposed move to Ireland and the medical records showed that she knew and understood that her house was being sold. She once more discussed the move with her GP on 20 August 2018 and had apparently understood and retained the relevant information. The GP recorded that IM was stressed and emotional and did not want to move to Ireland. However, he raised no concerns that IM lacked the capacity to decide to move. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 17 September 2018, IM&#8217;s home was sold for &#163;290,000 by VS. Solicitors acting for him confirmed to the OPG in January 2019 that VS had managed the sale of IM&#8217;s property and that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">everything was done legally and above board</span>&#8221;.  At that time IM was staying with AM. No-one in England saw IM or VS after that, including NS, friends, and neighbours though and it subsequently transpired that IM, VS and AM moved to Ireland in September 2018. A safeguarding alert was raised by the OPG with Kent County Council in January 2019 and the police were also notified. There were concerns that IM had not been registered at a new GP and so might not have been getting the medication she needed, and that her post was being redirected to AM&#8217;s address. These concerns were initially raised by NS who had passed IM&#8217;s house and had seen a skip outside. She established that the property had been sold and became concerned for IM&#8217;s welfare. It was clear that NS had not been told about IM&#8217;s move to Ireland with VS and also did not know about the Lasting Power of Attorney. She reported IM&#8217;s disappearance to the police and wrote to the OPG which commenced an investigation into possible financial abuse of IM.  </p>

The Convention came into force on 1 January 2009 (following its ratification by three states). It has now been signed by 18 states including the United Kingdom and Ireland. Though the United Kingdom has ratified the Convention, it has declared that the ratification applies to Scotland alone and thus the Convention is not yet in force in England and Wales. Ireland has not ratified the Convention. Therefore, the Convention does not apply in this case and recourse must thus be had to the wider provisions of Schedule 3 of the MCA. </p>

To the extent that she was capable of taking the decision to move to Ireland, this was a decision taken under the pressure and influence of VS. This could be seen from the history of VS&#8217;s influence over her; his control over her finances; her failing capacity and vulnerability; and her previous clear statements that she wished to remain in Kent (contrasted with the limited evidence of a positive wish on her part to move to Ireland). Alternatively, to the extent that the decision was taken by VS acting as IM&#8217;s welfare attorney, it was not a decision taken in good faith but was taken with the collateral purpose of obtaining access to the proceeds of sale of her home as demonstrated by his subsequent actions.

Though the HSE accepted that there was an element of stability to IM&#8217;s current placement, Mr Rees QC submitted that it could not be said she had yet acquired a habitual residence in Ireland, given the reasons why she was present in Ireland and her perception of her own situation.  </p>

There is some evidence that IM&#8217;s capacity fluctuated, particularly when she was suffering from infections. Thus, she was referred to a memory clinic in May 2017 and was also reported to be confused about her medication in spring 2018, at a time when she was suffering from urinary tract infections.  </p>

When discharged from hospital in November 2017, IM was assessed as having the capacity to make the decision about her discharge home with a package of re-enablement care. The assessment carried out in February 2018 expressly recorded there were no concerns about IM&#8217;s memory. Likewise, the assessment carried out in May 2018 raised no concern about IM&#8217;s mental capacity. In </p>

Though IM told her GP about the proposed move to Ireland on 23 July 2018 and again on 20 August 2018, her GP raised no concerns that IM lacked the capacity to decide to move even though he recorded her in August 2018 as being stressed and emotional and not wishing to move. I also note that IM was deemed to have capacity by her solicitors both to execute LPAs in May 2017, and to remove SFC as an attorney in July 2018. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Evidence of sustained cognitive decline only emerged in late October 2018 when IM was suffering from a succession of urinary tract infections requiring hospitalisation. It is unsurprising that those infections had an effect upon her cognition. Since her admission to OLL in January 2019, there have been periods of confusion noted in her records, and medical assessment in February 2019 found IM to lack capacity to manage her property and affairs. It is clear that she presently lacks capacity to make fully informed decisions. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Second, I find myself unpersuaded that IM&#8217;s decision to move to Ireland was a decision taken under unreasonable pressure from VS.  The relationship between IM and VS was undoubtedly complex. He provided her with care and support as her medical records attested and she was wholly reliant upon him. I have no doubt that IM&#8217;s decision to move to Ireland was made with the knowledge that she needed VS to care for her and did not want to live in England without him. That relationship of dependency between an elderly vulnerable person and their carer is entirely common and understandable. Though it is difficult to see objectively why IM would wish to move from Kent where she was long established and had potent family connections, the need to be with VS is likely to have displaced these and other considerations when IM agreed to move. For IM, the most important consideration would have been that she would continue to live with VS, who would look after her as he had already done for many years.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">No one involved with IM at the time was sufficiently concerned before the move to assist her in seeking advice support from statutory agencies. The move to Ireland was not achieved by stealth or made in an overly hasty manner. VS made no attempt to conceal the proposed move and IM discussed it freely with her GP and with FS over time. Her misgivings about moving expressed to the GP in August 2018 were understandable but do not, of themselves, suggest that IM had not voluntarily decided to move. Though that decision might have been unwise given that IM was leaving behind all she was familiar with, it was not without emotional and practical justification as far as IM was concerned. </p>

There is little doubt that VS handled IM&#8217;s money in a manner which properly aroused suspicion with the OPG. Given that the money lawfully owing to IM has been accounted for and repaid by VS with little protest, this might suggest that his dealings with IM&#8217;s money were characterised by incompetence and a failure to understand his duties pursuant to the property and affairs LPA rather than by a desire to enrich himself permanently at IM&#8217;s expense. There may be more than a kernel of truth in the account given by his solicitor to the OPG in January 2019, which detailed confusion and incompetence in managing the proceeds of sale. Whilst a matter of concern to the OPG and to this court, such dealings are not uncommon especially when many relatives have a poor understanding of their duties pursuant to a property and affairs LPA. Furthermore, there is no suggestion that IM was placed in a care home so that VS and AM could avail themselves of her money without the bother of caring for her. The move to OLL in November 2018 was prompted by IM&#8217;s poor health and I note that, on discharge from OLL in December 2018, IM returned to live with VS and AM who engaged a carer to help with her care. Her return to OLL appears to have been prompted by her medical and care needs and not because she had been abandoned by VS. Though concerned by VS&#8217;s behaviour with respect to IM&#8217;s property, I am not persuaded that the desire to enrich himself at IM&#8217;s expense was the sole justification for the move to Ireland. </p>

Though I have not heard from the OPG, it is regrettable that the OPG applied to withdraw the proceedings on 12 November 2019 when it knew that the issue of IM&#8217;s habitual residence was a matter unresolved by the court and did so without drawing that issue to the court&#8217;s attention. It is equally unfortunate that the court acceded to that application on paper without apparently recognising the unresolved issue of habitual residence though I note it did not then have available to it the reports submitted by the HSE on 22 November 2019 (although it did have available to it the HSE&#8217;s earlier report from June 2019).  </p>

However, it seems self-evident to me that care should be taken in concluding proceedings on paper where there are unresolved issues which might potentially have implications for the court&#8217;s jurisdiction and, most importantly, the welfare of a vulnerable and incapacitous person. Further, it seems to me that parties to proceedings should properly draw the court&#8217;s attention to those unresolved issues when making applications which might bring the proceedings to a conclusion. Had the OPG done so, the hearing on 25 November 2019 might well have gone ahead.  </p>
