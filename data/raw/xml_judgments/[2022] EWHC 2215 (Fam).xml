Following that hearing, I am advised that the father submitted the relevant documentation to the Reunite Mediation Service.  Earlier this month, Reunite Mediation Service informed the father&#8217;s solicitors they had not been able to make contact with the mother.  Mediation has therefore not happened.  This is more than disappointing: it is a wasted opportunity for the parties to take some collective responsibility for the future arrangements for their child.</p>

DNA evidence confirms the father&#8217;s paternity.  During 2020, the father made a number of visits to the UK from America (where he then then lived) to visit M. </p>

There is some dispute on the face of the papers as to the precise amount of time which the father spent with M, but it is reasonably clear &#8211; and I so find &#8211; that his contact with her was regular, extensive, and mutually enjoyable.  I find (indeed this is not really in dispute) that in the period immediately after his relocation to this country, he saw her approximately three times per week during the week, and he often stayed with the mother on a Saturday night so that he could spend Sunday with the mother and M.  The mother agrees that Sundays would be a &#8217;family&#8217; day involving all three of them.  Over a period of two weeks, I find that he looked after M for eight consecutive half-days on his own (when M was ill) while the mother worked<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		  <p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"> See the Post-Script to this judgment.  After the judgment, I heard some limited evidence about the time the father has spent with M; both parents gave brief evidence about this period.  I preferred the evidence of the father.</p>

As to &#167;67(ii), the father was living in the USA when M was born, but he did travel here on about three occasions to see her.  As to &#167;67(iii), I find that the father has shown a high level of commitment to M.  As I say, he travelled from the USA to see her on up to three occasions in her first year, before he relocated permanently from the USA to the UK in March 2021 to be nearer to her.  This, in my assessment, shows very significant commitment in itself.  Since then, I find that he has shown a high level of commitment to contact (including visiting Poland in recent months), and it appears that the attachment of the father and daughter is growing.  There is no real dispute that he has made proper financial provision for her. I am satisfied that he (supported by his wider family) wishes to play a full part in M&#8217;s life, a view which &#8211; significantly &#8211; is shared by the mother.  </p>
