At that time, there was only one child of the parties, George, born in 2018.  Since then, and during the pendency of the current proceedings, there have been three further children born to the parties, Hilary in 2020, Jude in 2021 and Kim in 2022.  The scope of the application has been widened to include all four children in the application for a child arrangements order.</p>

For reasons which I gave on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2023, the first day of the hearing of this matter, I decided that it was neither in the children&#8217;s interest nor proportionate to adjudicate on that application for enforcement and consider a punitive outcome for the mother as expressly sought by the father.  </p>

		  <num>&#8220;105.</num>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In respect of [the father], it is clear that he is intelligent, articulate, and committed to playing a significant role in the lives of his three children.  He has rightly expressed exasperation at the slow pace of these proceeding, it is iniquitous that it has taken two years to finally have a fact-finding hearing, to test [the mother&#8217;s] allegations of controlling and coercive behaviour.  The Family Law system in the UK, is under severe stress.  His contact with his children has been severely restricted. </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also correct to assert, as [counsel for the mother] did that [the father] is a misogynist, not in the narrow sense that he despises women, but in the broader sense that he thinks most women are inferior to most men.  This is clear from his evidence, that most women are driven by emotion and most men are driven by logic.  He is disparaging about the principle of equality of men and women and asserts that the role of men in general is being undermined, in particular in the Family Court, where women are too readily believed when they assert domestic abuse, to the detriment of men who want to spend time and/or play a significant role in the lives of their children.  His views in general are abhorrent, a Family Court is perfectly capable of discerning whose evidence is credible, irrespective of gender, there is no built-in bias in respect of women.  He will not accept this position.  Indeed, [the father] has sent me a lot of material, after my decision, to assert that he does not regard women as inferior, but that they function in a different way.  I am not prepared to revisit my findings they are based on what [the father] said in evidence at the hearing, he may wish to reflect upon the way he presents his views in the future. </p>

Thus, he speaks bluntly, and calls out untruths as he perceives them.  Behind his challenging presentation, is a rigid believe system that he is right and truthful, and those who do not agree with him are wrong and liars.  In this case, he is telling the truth, [the mother] has taken messages out of context, twisted their meaning, grossly exaggerated the impact upon her, and is a liar. </p>

He is challenging to deal with to such a degree, that at one point I considered abandoning the hearing, his interventions, his contempt for the court, for &#8216;liar lawyers&#8217;, and in particular the District Judge that had dealt with his earlier case in 2010 was to such an extent, that I wondered why he made this application at all. </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">He describes an attribute of his autism as naivety in respect of women, too ready to believe that they are sincere when they are really manipulative and asserts that he was taken in by [the mother].  Therefore, he now concludes that he was in his words, just a sperm donor, to enable her to have children, to be financially supported, and then to be removed from the lives of the children. That admission of vulnerability and manipulation, albeit that it carries underlying aspects of misogyny, I do, after considering the evidence, accept carries some weight in this case.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These finding were made at a fact-finding hearing, but the issues for determination at the hearing were a number of concrete issues, which did not include reaching a view of the father&#8217;s personality.  It is thus probably the case that the Judge&#8217;s comments on the father&#8217;s personality are not binding on the parties and this Court.  Nonetheless, from my own observations of the father, I can with only some minor differences of emphasis independently agree with District Judge Jabbitt&#8217;s observations above and his conclusions which I set out below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father represented himself before me.  He was clearly an intelligent man.  He works as a professional.  Before me, he did not emphasise (as he appears to have done before District Judge Jabbitt) any abhorrent views of women and instead made a more modest submission that men and women had different strengths and weaknesses.  On occasions, he showed that he was capable of some charm.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, these positive aspects of his presentation were wholly outweighed by his other behaviour.  The mother gave her evidence behind a screen.  In consequence of her allegations of abuse on his part, the father was prohibited from cross-examining her.  Due to the age of the case, the Court could not appoint a Qualified Legal Representative to cross-examine the mother.  Instead, the father provided a long list of questions which he wished should be put to the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When the mother came to give her evidence in chief whilst sitting behind the screen, the father repeatedly interrupted her, yelling abuse at her from the other side of the courtroom and alleging that she was a liar.  He refused to obey my directions that he should be silent and ignored my warning that, if he did not behave, he would be removed from the courtroom.  Only after I had security summoned and security arrived, did his behaviour moderate.  Mr Shaw says that even after security had arrived the father continued to threaten to fight him as counsel and the security guard, but this was not something I witnessed and formal evidence of this has not been put in evidence.  In fairness to the father, I should record that in his submissions to me on the final day of the hearing he did apologise to the Court.</p>

It appeared to be behaviour she had seen before.  No one would like this behaviour, but she appeared able to ignore it.  This is particularly surprising, because the mother is a vulnerable woman.  She was severely injured in a motor car accident in early adulthood and sustained brain injuries which resulted in epilepsy.  The epilepsy is fortunately now under control.  She presented as a slightly shy and nervous woman.</p>

This is an inference that I draw from the evidence of [the mother].  I can, of course understand why she would find his behaviour upsetting and challenging.  In her evidence she mainly said that she found his behaviour upsetting nothing more, but she was aware of the characteristics of his autism.  Overall neither her written or oral evidence persuaded me that she was subject to coercive and controlling behaviour, by [the father].  They have never lived together, she is not dependent upon him, she mainly set the occasions when they would meet, and have sex, and controlled his limited time with George, and subsequently with Hilary. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Phillips, who gave evidence to me as a social worker, reached a different conclusion.  The mother had filled out a questionnaire prepared by the local authority to help identify cases of domestic abuse.  On the basis of her responses to the questionnaire, he considered that there was domestic abuse and that the mother had been coerced into sexual relations with the father.  The questionnaire was not put in evidence, so I have not been able to assess it.  I can readily see how a bald account by the mother of, say, the abusive text messages sent by the father and his general behaviour might lead to a conclusion that this was a coercive relationship.  Mr Phillips did interview the mother.  However, he had little opportunity to see the father and the mother interacting: his focus was on two sessions of contact between the father and his children.  I can thus put less weight on his view of the relationship between the father and the mother.</p>

I asked the father how it came about that after George&#8217;s birth and the commencement of the current proceedings, he had a further three children with the mother (including one born after the hearing before the district judge).  He explained that what would happen was that the mother &#8220;got affectionate&#8221; with him and that things had gone on from there.  That had the ring of truth and was not substantially challenged on the mother&#8217;s behalf.  Like the district judge, I find that the sexual relations which resulted in the births of the four children were consensual.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father claims to have particular insights into George&#8217; behaviour, because he says that he himself is autistic.  As District Judge Jabbitt noted at para 107 of his judgment, no evidence of this beyond the father&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">ipse dixit</span> has been adduced.  Moreover, there is evidence before me, which was not available to Judge Jabbitt, which casts doubt on the diagnosis.  The father was brought up and still speaks bilingually, which tells against his suffering speech impairment.  His mother told Mr Phillips that &#8220;her son&#8230; had not had any difficulties with social communication as a child and had been fluent in both [languages] at his nursery before attending mainstream school.  She described having been shocked to learn about his recent Autism diagnosis.&#8221;  Given the weight which the father seeks to put on what he describes as his special insights into his son&#8217;s autism, it is (at least with the benefit of hindsight) unfortunate that the father has not adduced any evidence from the professionals who diagnosed him with the condition, or any evidence about how the particular autism from which he suffers manifests itself.  However, (as was the case before the district judge) there was no requirement for him to do.  Like the district judge, therefore, I feel obliged to accept that the father does suffer from autism.</p>

I do not accept that it gives him any special ability to determine what the best developmental programme for George might be.  The fact that the father thrived in a competitive environment does not mean that his son, whose autism is much more severe, will also thrive in such an environment.  As I shall discuss below, the father&#8217;s rigid belief system means that he does not accept that George is exposed to risks which are potentially dangerous.  In my judgment, minimising these dangers is a key factor when considering the welfare checklist.</p>

This amended provision strikes me as properly recognising the very significant toll protracted litigation can take on children and individuals who may already have become vulnerable, for a variety of reasons.  It also dovetails with our enhanced understanding of the nature of controlling and coercive behaviour.  When all other avenues are lost, too often the Court process becomes the only weapon available.  Lawyers and Judges must be assiduous to identify when this occurs, in order to ensure that the Court is not manipulated into becoming a source of harm but a guarantee of protection.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the current case, there are strong indications that the father may bring further proceedings unless steps are taken to control him.  I have already mentioned the application for enforcement steps to be taken against the mother.  I deal below with complaints which the father has made.  He has reported Mr Phillips to Social Work England with a view to that regulator taking disciplinary proceedings against him.  He has complained to the chambers of Mr Shaw, the mother&#8217;s counsel, about counsel&#8217;s alleged behaviour.  He has said, both orally and at item 4 of his response to the mother&#8217;s submissions for 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2023, that he intends to appeal.  This was even before I delivered any judgment or made any decision.  It is of course his right to seek permission to appeal and I do not hold that against him, but wanting to appeal even before a decision has been reached indicates a state of mind in which he will not let the dust settle on what on any view has been gruelling litigation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father is in my judgment perfectly capable, even before he has exhausted his appeal routes, of issuing fresh proceedings, seeking a variation of the contact and care arrangements.  This is because he strongly believes that the mother is giving the children poor care and will not accept the Court&#8217;s determination that he is in error on this.  He will continue to believe that he can provide the children with better care than she can and will continue to litigate to try and impose his view on the mother and children.  My conclusion on this is reinforced by the father&#8217;s suggested amendments to this judgment when I had it circulated in draft.  He wanted an alternation to this paragraph reflecting his view that it &#8220;is unbelievable that the Court thinks that the mother can provide adequate care for her&#8230; children&#8221; due to the size of her flat.</p>

The mother originally proposed a five-year order, but in the concluding submissions on her behalf it was submitted that seven years was more appropriate, given the children&#8217;s ages.  In my judgment, the five-year order is more appropriate.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 91(14)</ref> orders are not punitive.  It would in my judgment require stronger evidence than here to show that a period of longer than five years was needed.  If meritless applications are made after the expiry of the order, the Court can always make a fresh order.  Accordingly, I will make an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> against the father for a period of five years.</p>

Firstly, the parties can agree between themselves to increase contact.  Secondly, the father can apply to the Court for permission to bring fresh proceedings for a variation of the contact arrangements.  I strongly discourage the father from doing this until the current arrangements have bedded in or there is a major change in circumstances, but the order merely provides a filter for the making of such an application; it does not debar the father from seeking a variation.</p>

However, I consider that it will be rare that an order is made where there are not special circumstances.  The involvement of the State in the private lives of parents is inevitably intrusive.  As a result, in public law proceedings there is a significant hurdle for a local authority to jump before it can interfere with the parents&#8217; family life.  Absent the crossing of the hurdle, it is not generally in the best interests of the children that an emanation of the State continue to interfere in the private lives of a family.</p>

The father asserts that &#8220;the children will suffer greatly as a result of a lack of contact with their father as a result of no consequences on mother breaching contact orders even though she has been warned a number of times before.&#8221;  With respect this does not in my judgment establish an arguable ground of appeal.  Although there may be other ways of arguing an appeal on this issue, the most likely would be for the father to show that I had failed to take a relevant consideration into account or reached a conclusion which no reasonable judge would have reached.  He makes neither assertion and in my judgment neither assertion would be upheld on appeal.  Accordingly, this ground of appeal has no reasonable prospect of success.

The Court cannot see this as it presided over an unfair trial where applicant father was not given sufficient opportunity to expose the weaknesses in the social worker report prepared by David Phillips that the Court heavily relied upon.  A re-trial is required.&#8221;  The duty to give primacy to the interests of the children under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> is in full compliance with the duties of equality and respect for human rights.

A man is not permitted to fight hard for his kids in the UK feminist family courts without victimisation.  Applicant father will put a strong appeal to evidence that it is unfair and unreasonable that costs have been awarded against him.  Father has asked for additional information on the costs and Judge has stated that this is not proportional.  Judge is showing how biased he is as these costs are material to the father and what father is seeking is very proportional to him as information would not take long to provide.  This is yet another example of how this Judge operates to benefit mother!  An appeal is necessary.&#8221; </p>

It is submitted that I should have allowed the father to ask direct questions of the mother on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2023.  In the light of his behaviour that day, I regret to say I find this submission frivolous.  It is said that I did not ask the mother all the questions he had put in writing.  This is true, but I gave reasons at the time why I did not put certain questions to the mother.  The father does not identify the questions where I am said to have erred in not putting them to the mother.  Nor does he engage with my reasons for not putting particular questions to the mother.  The father submits that I should have engaged more vigorously in asking follow-up questions of the mother.  He does not particularise this submission, so it is not on its face a valid ground of appeal.  Moreover, as a general proposition, it would be wrong for a judge to engage in a classic cross-examination of a witness whom a party is debarred from examining.</p>
