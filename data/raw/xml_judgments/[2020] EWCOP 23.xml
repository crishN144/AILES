	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This is an application in the Court of Protection by VE for an order that it is in her mother, AO&#8217;s best interests to be allowed to leave the care home, &#8220;TO&#8221;, in which she is currently living and move to live with her daughter and her family. I first heard the application on Thursday 16 April but adjourned for further evidence. I then held the final hearing on Monday 20 April 2020. Given the extreme urgency of the situation in terms of AO&#8217;s terminal cancer and the risk of AO contracting Covid 19 I made my order at the end of the hearing but reserved my reasons, which I now set out in this judgment.  </p>

However, as the matter progressed it became increasingly clear that it was really a case about AO&#8217;s best interests under the MCA and the proportionality of the interference in her family life under article 8 ECHR.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">AO is an elderly Nigerian lady whose age is thought to be either 78 or 87, her birth not having been registered. She has a history of having suffered from mental illness. The full diagnosis is not clear in the papers before me but it certainly involved paranoid schizophrenia. She came to the UK about 20 years ago to live with her daughter, VE, and her family. On 22 September 2010 an order was made by DJ Ralton that it was in AO&#8217;s best interests to live at a care home, TO, and to have staying contact with VE. It is not clear whether there has been a standard authorisation under the MCA, but no reviews of any such authorisation appear to have taken place. The staying contact with VE was alternate weekends from Friday to Monday and four separate weeks each year. This contact has been taking place since 2010.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">When AO was staying with VE over Christmas 2019 VE became concerned about her mother&#8217;s health and her swollen abdomen. She took AO to the GP who referred her to King&#8217;s College Hospital for a scan. She was diagnosed with advanced terminal ovarian cancer which had spread to her other vital organs. AO had stayed with VE for some six weeks over Christmas. She was admitted to King&#8217;s College Hospital (KCH) in mid-January 2020. Unsurprisingly perhaps, VE was very concerned about the care of her mother at TO and applied for the 2010 order to be discharged and for AO to be allowed to move to live with her. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 6 March 2020 VE issued an application for personal welfare orders in respect of her mother seeking AO&#8217;s discharge from hospital into her care. Within those proceedings VE issued a further application on 9 April 2020 and the proceedings have now been reconstituted as a s.21A Mental Capacity Act challenge to AO&#8217;s deprivation of liberty. Various directions were made for the Official Solicitor to be invited to represent AO and for evidence to be produced. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">AO&#8217;s capacity had been assessed by a doctor at KCH on 28 February and AO had been found to lack capacity in respect of a decision as to where she lives. The form states that AO could not understand the concept of going somewhere else; was unable to summarise the information given to her; and could not retain that information or weigh it up. She was able to communicate but then could not remember what she had said. The conclusion was that she lacked capacity in respect of the decision in issue. AO was subsequently assessed by consultant psychiatrist Dr Cairns, pursuant to a direction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/49" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 49</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>, who, in her report dated 18 March 2020, concluded that AO lacks capacity to make decisions about her residence, care and support.&#8221; I note that all parties accept that AO does not have capacity in relation to decisions about where she lives. There is nothing in the later documentation which would lead me to doubt that AO does not have capacity either to litigate or to decide where she lives and I proceed on that agreed basis.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">AO was discharged from KCH on 23 March 2020 back to TO. Since that date she has not had any face to face contact with her family. TO, for very understandable reasons in the light of the current pandemic, is not allowing any visits from family members to residents. Some contact has been maintained by telephone calls and, on one occasion, a video call using a carer&#8217;s mobile phone but, given AO&#8217;s condition, this is not an effective way of maintaining contact with the family. There was some suggestion at the first hearing of AO using an iPad or similar device to maintain contact but, again, given her mental state, this was not a practical or effective solution in the longer term. Therefore, adequate contact could not be maintained at the present time between AO and her family, and this was accepted by all parties by the hearing of 20 April 2020. </p>

She has a large number of children, but only VE lives in the UK. AO came to the UK about 20 years ago to be with VE and VE&#8217;s children. VE herself has nine adult children and many grandchildren (AO&#8217;s great grandchildren) and the evidence suggests that it is a large and close family. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">According to VE, and I have no reason not to accept this, AO has been happy at VE&#8217;s home and has much enjoyed being with her and the children and grandchildren. VE speaks about AO enjoying dancing and Nigerian music and having African food. Food is something of an issue because at TO she can generally only have English food and she is currently not eating very much.  She enjoyed telling stories and jokes about Nigeria. AO was also in an environment where she could speak her native languages Hausa/Yoruba. From VE and BA&#8217;s evidence I have no doubt that AO is happy and content with VE and her family and it is highly likely that if she was in a position to express a choice she would want to live with them.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">VE&#8217;s evidence also covered the care that could be provided by her and the family at home. VE lives in a moderately large house, with four bedrooms. There are four other family members living in the house during the lockdown, including her son C who is 28 and well able to lift and turn his grandmother when needed. There is a room downstairs where AO sleeps when she comes on visits and a toilet and shower on the same level. VE has an appropriate bed for AO which prevents her falling out of bed and has a pressure mattress to alleviate the risk of bedsores. VE explained that AO can be fully cared for in terms of basic care needs by the family, including there being people who can help her get out of bed, go to the toilet and turn her in bed when necessary. VE proposes to sleep in the room with AO so that if she needs to get up in the night assistance will be immediately available.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There have been issues between VE and BA and the staff at TO. It is neither necessary nor appropriate for me to seek to delve too far into these. VE says that she has at times raised issues about the quality of care that AO has received and both she and BA say that they stopped regularly visiting AO in the Home because of the poor atmosphere. They both felt it was better for AO to see them when she came every second weekend for visits. VE was naturally very concerned that staff at TO had not picked up the signs of AO&#8217;s developing cancer.  BA said that she regularly saw AO (every second weekend) at VE&#8217;s house. The evidence suggests that AO&#8217;s family have shown a strong level of commitment to her and are extremely keen to have her home for her last days.  </p>

In terms of AO&#8217;s condition, it seems that she is significantly more dependant than when she was admitted to Hospital. It was not clear the degree to which her condition had changed since she had returned to TO in March. There were slightly conflicting views as to how ill AO currently is. However, it appears that she is not yet entirely bed bound and she can communicate. There was also a somewhat unclear situation at the time of the hearing on 20 April 2020, by which Ms Hobey-Hamsher had been told that AO had a cough and was being isolated within the home.  </p>

However, this is in the context where none of the existing residents were being tested.

Bio-security measures are being taken including handwashing, and separation/isolation of residents within the Home. It has to be said however that it is inevitably going to be extremely difficult to prevent spreading the disease within a home such as TO. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Ms Clegg gave oral evidence at the second hearing. She is an Associate Director of Integrated Commissioning within the South East London Clinical Commissioning Group (the CCG), previously the Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group. The CCG had not assessed AO&#8217;s needs so necessarily what she said about care that could and would be provided to AO was in general rather than specific terms. She said that staff, such as district nurses, were still visiting people in their own home and that staff had access to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) where appropriate. The service to those being looked after at home has not changed with the current pandemic, and in fact the CCG has commissioned additional capacity. In terms of the care that a district nurse would provide to AO, Ms Clegg said that there would be support for the family, ensuring that AO had the right equipment and any basic nursing care that AO needed at home. It was clear from Ms Clegg&#8217;s answers that there was no reason to believe that AO would not get appropriate support from the CCG if she went home. At the moment the only pain relief that AO is receiving is paracetamol and obviously that can be provided at home. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The other important area covered by Ms Clegg was the end of life care that AO would receive. Ms Clegg said that the CCG were very familiar with providing that type of care for people at home, including people lacking capacity. End of life care would be provided through St Christopher&#8217;s Hospice, and a community based palliative care service.  Pain relief can be provided, as appropriate, through pain relief patches and subcutaneous infusion and the district nurses can set this up. The district nurse service is familiar with, and sensitive to, issues around the patient&#8217;s dignity towards the end of life including respecting cultural beliefs and privacy. Mr Paget asked Ms Clegg about the levels of support that could be provided, and Ms Clegg said that it was difficult to answer such questions without a full assessment. She initially said that an assessment would take 4-6 weeks, but it was quite clear from her evidence that if there was a need an assessment could be carried out more quickly. She said that she could not rule out the need for AO to be in a 24 hour residential setting at the end of her life, but said that could be left open as an option and the CCG would endeavour to do its best for her to remain at home.  </p>

The real question for the court was, however, whether or not it was in AO&#8217;s best interests to continue to reside at TO or to move to live with VE and her family. Any decision as to deprivation of liberty would inevitably follow the best interests assessment as to where she lived.  All parties agreed that AO does not have capacity to litigate or to decide where she lives. </p>

The position was that the care home had, in accordance with appropriate guidelines produced to deal with the pandemic, stopped all family visits to residents. It was argued that there was a breach of articles 5 and 8 by the refusal to allow BP to leave the home and the refusal to allow him visits from his family.  The factual position was materially different from that of AO, in particular because BP was not terminally ill. In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">BP</span> the main argument was as to whether the care home could be required to reinstate family visits. Hayden J found at [36] that the plans for BP to return to live at home, cared for by family members, was not in truth a realistic option, and therefore the consideration of the court focused on the issue of contact with the family. </p>

This case concerns, as <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">BP</span> did not, questions as to whether it is in AO&#8217;s best interests to be allowed to live with her family in the last period of her life. The ability to die with one&#8217;s family and loved ones seems to me to be one of the most fundamental parts of any right to private or family life. That how a person dies can fall within the ambit of article 8 is now well established, see as but one example <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Pretty v UK</span> [2346/02] at [65]. I have not been able to find any case law on the degree to which an inability to die with one&#8217;s family engages article 8, but it would seem to me self-evident that such a decision by the state that prevents someone with a terminal disease from living with their family, must require a particularly high degree of justification under article 8(2). Wider public health considerations, such as the protection of the community by restricting visits to a care home were considered </p>

The focus of the case was very much on treatment and where she should be. But, of course, the introduction of the possibility of Nigeria adds a new dimension. It is an integral part of the concept of best interests when dealing with a person of this age that the court recognises the imminent possibility of death and the importance of making arrangements so as to secure that the experience of death may be in a context which is the most congenial and peaceful that can be devised. Also implicit in the concept of best interests is the importance of the country and culture of origin and the whereabouts of the family. They will often take precedence over, for example, the question of risk avoidance or the exact quality of care that may be available. It is not possible to travel without some incidence of risk, but that is a risk that may be easily outweighed by the benefits of successful travel. It may be the case, insofar as it is remotely the business of the court to investigate it, that the quality of care at the point of destination may not be the same as the quality of care at the point of departure. Those are matters also which may easily be overcome by the benefits of relocation, and it is in consideration of those matters that the question in principle of this lady&#8217;s transfer back to Nigeria is no longer controversial. It is clearly in her interests, having regard to her condition, her background and the whereabouts of her family, that she should if possible be transferred to Nigeria, and the evidence suggests that that is probably practicable. </span></p>

She argued that AO had had a very close and loving relationship with her family and that if she had been in a position to express her wishes and feelings it would have been to live with her family at this time. It was clear that the family were in a position to provide care for her despite the problems of the present lockdown. She also argued that there was no need to wait for further assessments in the light of the evidence of Ms Clegg. To the degree further assessments were needed, particularly in respect of end of life care, these could be undertaken once AO was living at VE&#8217;s house.  </p>

His position at the first hearing and the start of the second hearing was that it was premature to make such an order and it remained in AO&#8217;s best interests to stay at TO. He pointed out that she had lived there for 10 years and had not expressed a desire to leave and that no assessment had been carried out in relation to provision of care at VE&#8217;s home. The concerns he raised related to whether sufficient care could be given by the CCG, whether there was sufficient family support and whether appropriate equipment was available. By the end of the second hearing his position had somewhat softened, but he still said I should not make an immediate order for AO to leave TO, but rather should order a quick further assessment in the hope that AO might be able to move to VE&#8217;s home within 4-5 days.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I made the decision at the end of the second hearing that it was in AO&#8217;s best interests to leave TO and go to live with VE immediately. The order took immediate effect and AO moved on the evening of 20 April 2020. I must stress at the outset that the arguments before me turned on the fact that AO had terminal cancer and was going to die within a relatively short time. Nobody argued before me that I should not allow AO to leave TO because of the risk of Covid 19, or that any possible public interest in not allowing her to move outweighed her best interests, or her article 8 rights. At the time I made my decision it was not clear whether or not any of the other residents at TO had Covid 19, and it was not being said that AO had Covid 19, but this is a possibility given some accounts of her current symptoms. This is important because this judgment is solely about what is in AO&#8217;s best interests in circumstances where she had terminal cancer and her family wanted her to die at home with them.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I start with the basic proposition that most people would strongly wish to die with their family around them. I entirely agree with what Hedley J said in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">DU</span> that the court should seek to ensure circumstances of P&#8217;s imminent death that are as peaceful and dignified as possible. Given the Covid 19 pandemic, the need to minimise the spread of the virus and the current Government guidance if AO were to stay at TO, then the most contact that she would be likely to have would be one short visit from one family member at or around the time of her death. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Further, there is strong evidence that AO has enjoyed a close and loving relationship with VE and her family, over the 10 years AO has been living at TO. She has been very regularly spending weekends and holidays with VE and it seems clear that AO has much enjoyed the company of her daughter, grandchildren and great grandchildren. She has also plainly enjoyed the contact with her African heritage that spending time at home with VE has allowed in terms of food, language and things such as dancing and films. None of this is possible at TO, particularly at the present time.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The next issue is whether AO can be properly cared for if she moves to live with VE. In terms of day to day care, such as feeding, washing and taking AO to the toilet, I have no doubt that this can all be managed appropriately by VE and her family who are living with her during the lockdown. AO has been regularly staying with them, and indeed was staying there for about six weeks before she was admitted to King&#8217;s College Hospital in January. Family members will be able to assist AO with her basic needs and turn her in bed if that needs doing. The equipment that is needed in terms of an appropriate bed and mattress are already at VE&#8217;s house. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I was much more concerned about end of life palliative care, and in particular pain relief. However, Ms Clegg made clear that the CCG could commission such care, and this would include visits by district nurses who could ensure appropriate palliative care was provided. I am very grateful to Ms Clegg for the very straightforward and realistic evidence she gave, and the efforts the CCG is going to in these most difficult of times, to continue to provide end of life care to people at home. In those circumstances I have no hesitation in finding that AO can be fully and properly cared for at home, and I am no longer concerned that she will suffer unnecessary pain at the end of her life. </p>

The order I was being asked to make, unlike that in the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">BP</span> case, did not involve any increased risk to either residents or staff at TO. At the time of the hearing it was wholly unclear whether anyone at TO had contracted Covid 19. The manager, when speaking to Ms Hobey-Hamsher, said that she simply did not know because no residents were being tested. In terms of the risks of AO contracting Covid 19, that was necessarily a matter that I and everyone else in the case was conscious of, but it was not possible to quantify. Nor was it possible to know whether there was any risk of AO contracting Covid 19 and spreading it to her family if she moved to live with VE. This risk was not raised as a factor for me to take into account at the hearing.  </p>
