AB was then aged 3&#190;. The application has been ongoing continuously since that time. At an early stage in these proceedings the court directed that there should be a finding of fact hearing. That hearing still has not taken place. AB is now aged 7. The delay in this case has been inordinate and unacceptable.</p>

In the event, during the intervening period there were developments that required me to hear further submissions on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August in the light of which amendments were required to the draft judgment circulated on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August.

She informed her lawyer that when a child living in Poland she had been groomed by the father and that this had led to an intimate sexual relationship. Her lawyer contacted the police. I am told that the police investigation in Poland is ongoing. There is no evidence before the court of the stage that investigation has reached or of the likely timescale for making a decision about whether to charge the father with a criminal offence. The father informs the court that he has not been interviewed by the Polish police or asked to attend for interview.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The guardian is now on maternity leave. A new guardian has been allocated. The new guardian observed contact on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July. She has prepared a short written report following that contact. Her conclusions are as positive as those of her predecessor. Her concerns are not about father or paternal grandmother but about mother and step-father. She expresses concern about the absence of communication between step-father and father during handovers, noting that the step-father would not even make eye contact. She also expresses concern that AB &#8216;is very aware of his mother&#8217;s negative feelings towards his father&#8217;.</p>

Notwithstanding the positive assessment of the grandmother, the mother continues to insist that there should at all times be a professional supervisor present during each contact session. The contact on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July should have lasted for three hours. The guardian had to leave after two hours. Contact could have continued under the grandmother&#8217;s supervision. The mother insisted that contact should then end. Miss Vickers submits that it is clear that the mother&#8217;s hostility towards contact is implacable and is unlikely to abate no matter what findings are made by the court.</p>

She submits that the adjournment of the most recent attempt to conduct a finding of fact hearing was caused by &#8216;extenuating circumstances&#8217; beyond the mother&#8217;s control and that it would be disproportionate, at this late stage, to discharge the order for a finding of fact hearing. To do so would be a breach of the mother&#8217;s Article 6 right to a fair trial. Until the court has considered the mother&#8217;s allegations and determined whether she has discharged the burden of proof, the court will be unable to make a fully considered determination of the appropriate welfare outcome for AB.</p>

It is accepted on her behalf that because of the inevitable uncertainty about the precise date upon which the baby will be born and about the condition of mother and baby immediately following the birth, it would be unwise to relist the proposed finding of fact hearing before January 2017, some 3&#190; years after the father first issued his application. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">It is questionable whether it is still possible to have a fair trial of the issues. The issues raised by the mother relate to the father&#8217;s conduct towards her between 2002 and 2008. There was no police investigation. There are no contemporaneous statements or notes. There was no medical examination of the mother. Her witnesses are herself and her father. Her father did not observe the alleged grooming or sexual abuse. On this issue the maternal grandfather&#8217;s evidence primarily rests upon &#8216;disclosures&#8217; made to him by the mother. Logically, one might have thought that maternal grandmother, who was living with the father and her two children throughout all of the relevant time, would have more relevant evidence to give. I note that if this finding of fact hearing proceeded is allowed to continue, the maternal grandmother has agreed to give evidence on behalf of the father. The maternal grandmother&#8217;s evidence is challenged by the mother. Her position has led to an estrangement between mother and daughter.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In her schedule of findings the mother includes an allegation that the father has in the past physically chastised AB. There is corroborative evidence from her father though, as I noted earlier, his evidence on this issue appears to be somewhat limited. There is no evidence that the mother has ever reported abuse to statutory agencies or to her Health Visitor or GP. There is evidence that the prior to November 2012 the mother had allowed the father to have unsupervised contact with AB, including overnight contact. The mother does not allege that AB was physically abused during those periods.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Leaving the issue of physical abuse to one side, the evidence does raise a concern that AB may have suffered and that he is at risk of suffering emotional harm. The emotional harm from which AB may already have suffered arises from the sudden cessation of his contact with his father and the long period of time during which there was no contact with his father. The risk of future emotional harm arises from the risk of enforced curtailment of his recently renewed and developing relationship with his father.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">There is no reason to doubt the mother&#8217;s ability to meet AB&#8217;s physical needs. Her apparent implacable hostility to the recommencement and development of a meaningful relationship between AB and his father raises doubts about her ability to meet all of AB&#8217;s emotional needs. As for the father, the evidence from the two guardians suggests that he may have the ability to meet both AB&#8217;s physical and emotional needs. However, as that evidence has only been gleaned from observing a handful of contact sessions, I accept that that evaluation of the father&#8217;s capacity to meet AB&#8217;s needs must be treated with a degree of caution. It is, at best, only a provisional assessment. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The quality of the medical evidence before the court concerning the recent health problems of both the mother and AB is very brief and, in my judgment, inadequate. There has been no opportunity to test that evidence in court. So far as concerns the evidence that AB is suffering from shingles and as a result &#8216;prohibited from travelling for two weeks&#8217; it is necessary to view that evidence in its chronological context. On Wednesday 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August I ordered that AB should be returned to England by 4.00pm on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August. The mother was made aware of my order that same day. On Thursday, 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August, AB is said to have presented with a rash and a temperature. On Friday, 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August, AB was taken to see a doctor who made the diagnosis of shingles. On Saturday 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> or Sunday 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August (it is not clear which) step-father set off from Poland on his return journey to England.</p>

He does not have the capacity to look after AB on his own because of his work commitments. There are no other family members in England who could care for him.</p>

By 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August it was clear that she has no access to Skype. She also proposes that her husband bring AB back to England on one occasion. She suggests that the father could have contact with AB in Poland if he wishes. Although she says that she is &#8216;content&#8217; for that to happen, the concerns raised by the guardians make it difficult to evaluate the mother&#8217;s sincerity without hearing her evidence on oath.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I have significant reservations about the extent to which the mother can be relied upon to return AB to England after the birth of her baby. By then she will be settled in Poland. She will have been there for four months. Poland is where she wants to be. That is why she has now issued an application for leave to remove AB permanently from the jurisdiction. The evidence strongly suggests that the mother is hostile towards the father having contact with AB. There is in my judgment a real possibility that when the time comes to return to England with AB and her new baby the mother will consider it a  reasonable gamble to remain in Poland in breach of any order to return him to England, taking a chance that the she can successfully defend a Hague application. It is arguable that her behaviour so far suggests that she may already have decided to take that gamble.</p>

There is a risk &#8211; and in my judgment it is a real risk and not a fanciful risk &#8211; that the green shoots of growth in the father&#8217;s relationship with AB may wither and perhaps die. If that were to happen it is likely that that would be seen by the father as the final injustice at the end of a process which, because of inordinate delay, has itself been unjust.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">To that rhetorical question there is a very simple answer. The order I made required the mother to ensure that AB was returned to England by 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August. It was not an order that she herself should return to England. It was an order made in the belief that her husband was returning to England on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August. As I noted earlier, although the mother says that because of his work commitments her husband would not have the capacity to care for AB, from 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> to 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016 the mother travelled to Poland leaving her three children &#8211; AB and his two younger half-siblings &#8211; in the care of her husband.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August I made the point that if the mother&#8217;s husband is genuinely unable to care for AB in her absence then that leaves two possibilities. The first is that AB should go and live with his paternal grandmother. That possibility is problematic given that I have heard no evidence from the guardian on the appropriateness of such an arrangement. As the father lives quite some distance away from the mother&#8217;s home in England, such placement would of necessity mean that AB would have to move to a new school.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The second, more realistic alternative as a short term option until the mother returns to England later in the year is that AB is accommodated in local authority foster care. That would enable him to remain at his present school, to have regular contact with both his step-father and his birth father. He could have regular contact with his mother by telephone. It was with that in mind that I invited the relevant local authority to be represented by one of its solicitors at the adjourned hearing on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August. In the event, for the reasons set out earlier in this judgment, this case in fact came back before me on Monday 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August. The local authority was represented by a solicitor. A social worker was also present. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August Miss Popley, for the mother, sought to persuade me to allow AB to remain in Poland with his mother until after the birth of her baby.

At the hearing on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August Miss Popley sought to persuade me to amend the return order by extending the date for AB&#8217;s return to England to 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> September, that being 14 days after he was diagnosed as suffering from shingles. I am in no doubt that in asking her counsel to make that proposal on her behalf, the mother was being disingenuous. Nothing I have read or heard during the various hearings that have taken place this month gives me the slightest confidence that the mother is prepared to arrange for AB to return to England prior to the birth of her baby. I am scarcely more confident in her willingness to bring AB back to England after the birth of her baby.</p>
