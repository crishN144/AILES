He has developed alcohol related brain damage and is assessed as meeting the criteria for a &#8216;dissocial personality disorder&#8217;.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The MCA provides a specific statutory definition of mental capacity which is termed to be &#8220;decision specific&#8221;, predicated on a &#8220;functional approach&#8221;, evaluated in the framework of a &#8220;diagnostic threshold&#8221;. Thus, at the core of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> is a central distinction between the inability to make a decision and the making of a decision which, objectively, would be regarded by others as unwise. Fundamentally, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> emphasises the right of the individual, in exercising his or her personal autonomy, to make bad decisions even extending to those with potentially catastrophic consequences (see: <span style="font-weight:bold">Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust v MSP <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2020/26" uk:canonical="[2020] EWCOP 26" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWCOP 26</ref></span>).  </p>

The presumption of capacity, Section 1(2), is the bench mark for decision makers in this sphere. To my mind it is every bit as important as the presumption of innocence in a criminal trial. </p>

The scope of these unambiguous provisions requires fully to be recognised and vigilantly guarded. The philosophy informing the legal framework illuminates the point that this case highlights, namely <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision&#8217;</span>. This statutory imperative reflected extensive common law jurisprudence, prior to the Mental Capacity Act, recognising that the law does not insist that a person behaves <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;in such a manner as to deserve approbation from the prudent, the wise or the good&#8221;</span>: <span style="font-weight:bold">Bird v Luckie (1850) 8 Hare 301.</span> It is the ability to take the decision, not the outcome of it which is in focus: <span style="font-weight:bold">CC v KK and STCC <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2012/2136" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCOP 2136" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWHC 2136 (COP)</ref>; Kings College Hospital NHS Trust v C &amp; V <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2015/80" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCOP 80" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCOP 80</ref>. </span></p>

What is required is that the person is able to employ the relevant information in the decision-making process and determine what weight to give it relative to other information required to make the decision. Where a court is satisfied that a person is able to use and weigh the relevant information, the weight to be attached to that information in the decision-making process is a matter for the decision maker. Thus, where a person is able to use and weigh the relevant information but chooses to give that information no weight when reaching the decision in question, the element of the functional test comprised by s 3(1)(c) will not be satisfied. Within this context, a person cannot be considered to be unable to use and weigh information simply on the basis that he or she has applied his or her own values or outlook to that information in making the decision in question and chosen to attach no weight to that information in the decision making process.&#8221; </span></p>

PB remained in hospital for three weeks following this, until an application was lodged, in early June 2019, seeking court authorisation for a planned discharge to a specialist supported living placement with a package of care intending to restrict PB&#8217;s access to alcohol.

The primary purpose, perhaps even the only purpose, of the requirement of an escort is to prevent PB from drinking. These restrictions have been authorised by a variety of orders between September 2019 and the present. It is important to record that to test PB&#8217;s resolve and respect his assertion of a wish to moderate his drinking, a trial period was negotiated in which it was planned that PB should be permitted to leave the unit unescorted for 2-hour periods. Though PB denies it, I have no difficulty in concluding, on the evidence, that, on a number of occasions in December 2019, he returned far later than arranged, gave the appearance of being drunk and was abusive to members of the staff. On the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019 he urinated and vomited in his bed overnight.

Happily, there has been no repetition of the behaviour on the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019. The Official Solicitor noted that the applicant was unclear as to whether the current arrangements amount to a Deprivation of Liberty, given that PB is content to live where he is, on the proviso that he is permitted to drink. At the moment, he has achieved his wish by default rather than design. I consider that the arrangements amount to deprivation of liberty because they curtail PB&#8217;s choices and require him to exercise guile and deception to achieve his own wishes.

PB appeared to have forgotten a number of his previous hospital admissions, he acknowledged experiencing symptoms of alcohol dependency and was able to reason why, in future, he would be able to moderate his drinking. His thoughts are coherent on this, he identifies the importance of his present stable home base and the fact that he is no longer &#8220;around alcoholics&#8221; as factors which can moderate his behaviour. Dr Costafreda considered, in this first report, that PB <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;seriously overestimates his ability to keep his alcohol dependence under control&#8221;</span> but, concluded that he had the capacity to make decisions about residence and care on three principle grounds:</p>

The application of Dr Costafreda&#8217;s test would have the alarming effect of rendering most addicts incapacitous if they are unable to agree with the precepts of the test whilst, to my mind, making a deprivation of liberty almost inevitable to those who are able to agree <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;beyond doubt&#8221;</span> that they are <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;certain&#8221;</span> to drink to excess.

Instead of the true fact of his lack of control over alcohol, his thinking is informed by the belief that he will be able to contain his drinking within relatively safe limits. I think this is due to a combination of his alcohol dependence, with lack of insight in his inability to control his drinking, as well as executive dysfunction caused by alcohol-related brain damage, which causes impairment in the planning and monitoring of his own behaviour, so he is unable to learn from the repeated failures to control his drinking.

On the contrary, PB&#8217;s analyses his dependency on alcohol in a way which is both articulate and rational. He is also clear as to the dire consequences of his drinking to excess. He makes the association between the consequences of drinking to excess and the impact on his care arrangement. He reconciles the two in his own mind by his conclusion that he should stay where he is but moderate his drinking to reasonable limits. There is within his plan an inherent recognition that drinking to excess and the sustainability of the placement are irreconcilable.  There is much evidence from PB&#8217;s history that he is unlikely to be able to achieve this, but the potential gulf between his aspiration to moderation and the likely reality, does not negate the thought processes underpinning his reasoning. In any event I do not consider that there is evidence here which is sufficiently choate to rebut the presumption of capacity. The plan that PB identifies may not be sustainable long term but that does not permit an inference that he is unable to foresee the consequences of drinking to excess on the sustainability of the placement. </p>

There may be many women who are seen to be in relationships with men regarded by professionals as predatory sexual offenders. The Court of Protection does not have jurisdiction to act to 'protect' these women if they do not lack the mental capacity to decide whether or not to be, or continue to be, in such a relationship. The individual's decision may be said to be 'against the better judgment' of the woman concerned, but the point is that, unless they lack mental capacity to make that judgment, it is against </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">their</span><span style="font-style:italic"> better judgment.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It has to be remembered that Dr Costafreda&#8217;s conclusions in respect of PB&#8217;s capacity changed during the course of his assessments. There is no doubt, in my mind, that PB&#8217;s failure to achieve sobriety in the trial period led Dr Costafreda to re-evaluate his approach to the question of capacity. Whilst I accept, in principle, that the relevant issues identified as illuminating capacity may require to be revisited in the context of a particular case, I can see no clear or logical reason for revising them here. The fact that PB consumed excessive alcohol, having expressed his goal as being moderation, does not strike me as requiring the criteria to be recalibrated. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that Dr Costafreda, having plainly identified a regime of abstinence and sobriety as being in PB&#8217;s best interest, considered that his resistance to it and the stark consequences that might flow from it, must indicate an incapacity in his reasoning. The far more obvious conclusion, on the evidence, is that Dr Costafreda recoiled from PB&#8217;s bad decision. The decision may hasten PB&#8217;s death but PB, like any of us and for the reasons foreshadowed above, is entitled to make bad decisions if he chooses to do so. This is the respect for individual autonomy which courses through the MCA.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It seems to me that the position here is not dissimilar to that found by the Court in <span style="font-weight:bold">PC &amp; Anor v City of York Council </span>(supra), where <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;understandable professional concern&#8221;</span> for a vulnerable woman led to the construction of a test for capacity which was too high and motivated by a desire to protect her. Here, an appreciation of and sympathy towards PB&#8217;s vulnerability and the entirely accurate recognition of his parlous situation, strikes me as having cast a shadow over the forensic rigour required in an assessment. Dr Costafreda&#8217;s various reports identify this as a difficult and delicate assessment. As I have stated but consider it appropriate to repeat, we are concerned here with that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;space&#8221;</span> identified by MacFarlane LJ between an &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">unwise decision</span>&#8221; and one which <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;an individual does not have the mental capacity to take.&#8221;</span> The imperative, in these circumstances, is not paternalistically to protect PB&#8217;s health and welfare but to respect his autonomy. PB&#8217;s desire to live where he is presently based, but on his own terms, strikes me as consistent with his recognition of his limited options.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Having determined that the flaw in PB&#8217;s decision making was his inability to understand that he would never be able to drink alcohol other than to excess, Dr Costafreda set a test which was too high and did not integrate those facets of PB&#8217;s reasoning which had caused him, in his earlier assessment, to conclude that PB had the capacity to decide on issues relating to his residence and care. In to this also requires to be factored, as I have stressed, that PB is perfectly happy to remain where he lives but with greater freedom surrounding his use of alcohol. I am not being asked to consider whether PB has the capacity to decide to take alcohol or not but whether </p>

Having concluded that the test for capacity settled upon by Dr Costafreda was too high, it is not necessary for me to scrutinise his explanation of the likely cause of that deficiency. However, I have noted at paragraph 39<span style="font-weight:bold"/>above that I was not persuaded that the evidence established the necessary nexus between the disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain and inability to make a decision. </p>

He did not give sworn evidence but he addressed me from the floor of the court where he appeared to feel more comfortable. I have addressed his statements and what he has told me in the course of this judgment. In their closing submissions counsel did not address me on the question of litigation capacity. I agree there was no need to do so. I am satisfied that PB&#8217;s views were clear, accurately reflected in the submissions of the Official Solicitor and that his voice was heard appropriately.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As is plain from my analysis above, I do not consider that it is possible to give guidance in the prescriptive manner which may have been contemplated by DJ Eldergill. I am also conscious that I have not addressed separately and directly the second issue in his order (see paragraph 3 above). I understand the concerns underlying this second issue and I hope I have analysed them in my reasoning above. However, I am uncomfortable with the terminology used in the order. The order enquired <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;whether or in what circumstances the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (MCA) should be used coercively to prevent people who are alcohol dependent from gaining access to alcohol.&#8221; </span>Coercion has pejorative implications, it implies persuasion by use of force or threats. As such it has no place in the Court of Protection and jars entirely with the applicable principles of the MCA. Moreover, the question only arises when the issue of capacity has been determined. If P has capacity then manifestly <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> does not apply. If P lacks capacity, facilitating compliance with a regime to which he is opposed will always involve the lightest possible touch, the minimal level of restraint or restriction and for the shortest period of time. In other words, the level of intervention must be proportionate. I am entirely confident that this balance is what DJ Eldergill was contemplating.  </p>
