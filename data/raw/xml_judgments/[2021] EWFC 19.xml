His father is of Kurdish heritage but has Norwegian citizenship.   The father is resident in Norway and has been living there for 20 years. He works as a catering manager in the offshore oil industry. His job requires him to spend every other month at sea. EM &#8217; mother is the Respondent LB , who was born in , Morocco but has lived in the UK since 2010. She has an older daughter, Z aged 9 years, from another relationship and a second son born in the UK in  [a date in] 2020, now aged 2 months. Although he is the father&#8217;s child, he is not the subject of this application, given the country of his birth. </p>

His habitual residence is therefore acknowledged to have been Norway at the time of his removal to this country. The mother was pregnant, expecting the parties&#8217; second child, when she came to the UK. The mother alleges serious domestic abuse of her and the children by the father, and says that as a consequence of that she left Norway with EM and Z to return to the UK. She accepts that she initially told the father that she was visiting Oslo on 24 July, together with the children, but then recounts an incident at a bus stop as she was leaving when she says that she told him she would be going to the UK. The father does not accept that this happened. The following day, on 25 July, the father called her mobile phone and he reached an English language voicemail. He says that he has not been able to contact the mother or the children directly since.   </p>

He says that this order was obtained at a time when he was not aware of the mother&#8217;s address and so she could not be sent notice of the hearing. The order is expressed to lapse if no action is brought by 11 February 2021, so it may no longer still be in force. He also made this application pursuant to the 1980 Hague Convention which was issued on 17 September 2020, and which was heard by Mr Alex Verdan QC on 18 September without notice to the mother; location and disclosure orders were then made.  </p>

Further, she states that if a return order is made, she would not return with him, such is her state of fear for her own life if she is left at risk of assault from the father.

There is a particular risk that an expansive application of article 13b, which focuses on the situation of the child, could lead to this result. Nevertheless, there must be circumstances in which a summary return would be so inimical to the interests of the particular child that it would also be contrary to the object of the Convention to require it.

Next, on 8 January 2021, the matter came before a Deputy  High  Court judge , when further directions were given including a refusal of the mother&#8217;s application for the appointment of an expert psychologist under FPR 2010 Part 25, to report on whether EM would be likely to have suffered psychological harm from the behaviour shown by the father in a video taken on her phone, and on which she continues to rely.

It is for them to produce evidence to substantiate one of the exceptions. There is nothing to indicate that the standard of proof is other than the ordinary balance of probabilities. But in evaluating the evidence the court will of course be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of the Hague Convention process. It will rarely be appropriate to hear oral evidence of the allegations made under article 13b and so neither those allegations nor their rebuttal are usually tested in cross-examination.&#8221; </p>

She has set those out in a number of statements, and I have watched the video evidence and listened to the recorded conversations which she says bolster her case. Her allegations are in large part denied by the father, although he does admit in the recorded conversations to what appears at least to have been a measure of inappropriate restraint.

This is in part because of the summary nature of this process, and in part because even if the allegations made by the mother are true, as they may be, the question of whether a return order should be made will be critically affected by the determination of whether sufficient protective measures can be put in place in the event of a return, to avoid for EM the intolerable situation contemplated by the Article. </p>

More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home&#8230; if the risk is serious enough to fall within article 13(b) the court is not only concerned with the child's immediate future, because the need for effective protection may persist. </p>

[Counsel] submits that there is a sensible and pragmatic solution. Where allegations of domestic abuse are made, the court should first ask whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. If so, the court must then ask how the child can be protected against the risk. The appropriate protective measures and their efficacy will obviously vary from case to case and from country to country... Without such protective measures, the court may have no option but to do the best it can to resolve the disputed issues </p>

It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be "real". It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as "grave". Although "grave" characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two. Thus a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as "grave" while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm. </p>

Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress. It is part of growing up. But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself. Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent. [Counsel] accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: e g, where a mother's subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child." </p>

That is not to say that it has not, nor indeed that all of the violent incidents that the mother alleges towards herself have not happened; but these recordings, shorn as they are of proper context and some very short in length, are not conclusive evidence that they have.

I asked Mr Powell for the best evidence of this, given that an incident filmed in a video now relied on did not appear at all in the mother&#8217;s non-molestation statement, and only became part of her case after she introduced the videos. In that statement, the mother had said that the father told her that he would kill her before the police could reach her and that before that he would &#8216;kill her children in front of her&#8217;.  He confirmed that the only evidence of a direct threat to the child relied on is contained in the video, which she says shows the father &#8216;being aggressive to EM both verbally and physically&#8217;. The video itself starts by showing EM sitting on the floor next to the father, and it then pans in on the child for the rest of its duration. The father can no longer be seen. He is speaking off camera in Kurdish. EM is only around 8 months old and looks somewhat bemused. There is no physical contact between the 2 for the duration of the video. The mother describes the father &#8216;talking sharply and loudly to him&#8217; and &#8216;the sound of a slap&#8217;. There is no contact made with EM during the short excerpt, nor any overt physical threat. What is surprising, and of course concerning, is the translation of the Kurdish words spoken which apparently include &#8216;I will kill you, kill you&#8217;. But they do not appear spoken in anger or with intent, and there is no proper context provided for the situation.  </p>

The case dealt with the question of whether, in the context of the effect on a parent's mental health for the purpose of Article 13(b), there needed to be an objectively reasonable or realistic risk or whether the parent's subjective perception of the risk could be sufficient.

No doubt a court will look very critically at an assertion of intense anxieties not based upon objective risk; and will, among other things, ask itself whether they can be dispelled. But in <span style="font-style:italic">In re E</span> it was this court's clear view that such anxieties could in principle found the defence. Thus, at para 34, it recorded, with approval, a concession by [Counsel], that, if there was a grave risk that the child would be placed in an intolerable situation, "the source of it is irrelevant: eg, where a mother's subjective perception of events lead to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child". Furthermore, when, at para 49, the court turned its attention to the facts of that case, it said that it found </p>

If the court concludes that, on return, the mother will suffer such anxieties that their effect on her mental health will create a situation that is intolerable for the child, then the child should not be returned. It matters not whether the mother's anxieties will be reasonable or unreasonable. The extent to which there will, objectively, be good cause for the mother to be anxious on return will nevertheless be relevant to the court's assessment of the mother's mental state if the child is returned." <span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">&#8230; </span></p>

As Lord Wilson said, the "critical question is what will happen if, with the mother, the child is returned". Although the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the "mother's anxieties" and/or the fact that they are not based on an objective risk may lead "a court [to] look very critically" at the case advanced by the mother, neither of these elements prevent the court from determining that "the mother will suffer such anxieties that their effect on her mental health will create a situation that is intolerable for the child". It is clear that "subjective perception" can be sufficient. </p>

Applying this approach, I do not consider that, the fact that "by the time of this hearing the mother's mental health was stable", supports the judge's conclusion&#8230;, that "her case as to a fundamental change of circumstances is [not] made out". The question was, not whether the mother was stable at that time, but what would happen if she went with B to Bosnia. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.44in;margin-right:0.06in">So, I must first determine whether there is an objective risk to the mother in the event of a return being ordered. In the absence of any protective measures, then there may be such a risk as I have outlined above. However, with proper protective measures in place, then clearly that risk objectively recedes. If I determine that those measures would objectively be sufficient to provide suitable protection, then I must &#8216;look very critically&#8217; at her &#8216;assertion of intense anxieties not based upon objective risk&#8217; (per Lord Wilson in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span> at [27] [above]), and ask whether they can be dispelled. I quite accept that those anxieties, if they were to present in the mother upon her return to Norway, are capable of founding a defence under the article, whether or not objectively justified. </p>

The tone and inflection of her voice in her conversations with him which she has recorded give no intimation at all that she is in any way intimidated by him or in fear for her life. If anything she treats him with mild contempt. </p>

Indeed the fact that the alleged threat to EM is based solely upon the short video taken by her of the child sitting on the floor, and was not even remembered by her as an incident of threat until she later looked at the recording is telling. The fact that she did not mention the allegation in her initial statement, nor seek any protective orders in relation to EM in September, makes her vehement later reliance upon it far less persuasive. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.44in;margin-right:0.06in">Having found as I do that, with robust protective measures in place, any objective risk of harm to EM will be appropriately mitigated, my critical appraisal of the mother&#8217;s case as it stands does not satisfy me that, if she were in fact to return to Norway with the children, her ability to care for them would be in any way compromised. Indeed, I am quite satisfied from what I have seen and heard in the evidence, and read in the statements, that if she were to return she would cope well, particularly given the protective measures which would by then be in place. Consequently it would not be appropriate for me to decline to make a return order on that ground.  </p>

I hope that the mother does choose to return with him, and her other children, whilst the longer term future of the children is resolved by the Norwegian courts. However, in the event that she elects not to, I have not seen any evidence which persuades me that the father has made a realistic threat to harm EM. The only specific evidence on which the mother relies for this is the video clip, and I do not accept that that provides credible evidence of a real threat. This is only confirmed by the fact that as I have indicated, the mother evidently did not consider it to be so at the time, as she sat filming; such a threat evidently formed no part of her reasons for leaving Norway. I have no evidence before me which leads me to believe that the father is not perfectly capable of caring for EM, if the mother does not return with him. </p>

Consequently, I cannot find that there is an established risk that this father&#8217;s drinking poses a threat if the mother chooses not to return with EM and he is returned into the care of his father. In this regard I am fortified by the protective measures which Miss Renton has offered, especially that at [h] below, which to ensure appropriate protection given the untried allegations must be offered in addition to the terms of the September injunction.  </p>

Z was spoken to and appropriate background checks into her ongoing welfare made, within weeks of the incident. The discontinuation of that involvement happened only after assurances from the mother that no further investigation was merited, and a follow up interview offered was not taken up. I am therefore satisfied that the Norwegian authorities will if needed offer entirely appropriate support and protection for this family upon any return. </p>

In this regard I also have in mind that Norway is like the United Kingdom a signatory to the 1996 Hague Convention, and as such protective measures may be directed here as a matter of urgency (Art.5 (1)), which will be recognised by the Norwegian Court (Art.23), but lapse once Norway has &#8216;taken the measures required by the situation&#8217; (Art.5 (2)).
