	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H was one of two senior partners in a private equity business (X Co).  It ran in a typical way: X Co would find institutional investors who would commit to investing capital when X Co needed their funds to make portfolio investments or for running costs.  Once the capital had been raised X Co would find suitable investments and buy stakes in them with growth prospects.  X Co managed the investment and would take a role on the board of the company in which the investment was made.</p>

When capital was called to make the investment, a small part of that capital was owned by various individuals at X Co.  It was this investment, known as X Co Co-Invest share, which W was to share in to the extent of 78.19% of H&#8217;s receipts.</p>

This would be a percentage of profits above the hurdle rate.  W was to share to the extent of 48.53% of H&#8217;s receipts. If the hurdle was not reached, then no carry was paid.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the time that the matter was before Mostyn J there were two X Co funds, Fund I and Fund II.  To reduce the amount of communication between the parties and intermingling of their finances, Mostyn J determined that W&#8217;s award would be payable only out of H&#8217;s receipts from Fund I and, doing very precise mathematical calculations, W&#8217;s potential interest in Fund II was rolled over into the award that she was to receive on Fund I. This explains the size of the percentages.</p>

They had various exit dates in the future, none of which were fixed at the time of the trial, in the sense that they remained capable of extension.  Two of the investments were subsequently sold in their entirety, as was 80% of the third.  W received in cash the sums that she was due under the terms of the order in respect of them.</p>

These were sold to a new private equity fund, managed by the same X Co team but with a different set of investors, some of whom were new and some of whom had invested in Fund I.  The new fund was a continuation fund, which I shall abbreviate to CF. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The use of a CF in the industry is widespread.  It is commonly found where a fund is ending but it has some assets left which for one reason or another cannot be sold or which it would be inadvisable to sell at the time in question.  Unless they are transferred to a CF, those investors who wished to cash out of their investment would be unable to do so.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In order to establish a CF, it is crucial to obtain a fair market valuation of the assets to be transferred so that justice is done to those investors who were leaving and those investors who were participating in the CF.  There has been no suggestion to me that the valuation exercise was done anything other than in a fair and proper manner, as one would expect from the well-known advisors who were used for this purpose.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The team members from X Co who had capital invested in Fund I or who held carried interests did not have the same flexibility as the third-party investors to decide whether or not to make an investment in the CF.  One of the conditions of the commercial deal between X Co and the third-party investors in CF was that the X Co team had to reinvest their after-tax proceeds into the CF.  The extent of their investment was the subject of negotiation and was eventually determined as being at least &#8364;10m from the net distributions received by them from their co-investments and carried interests.  In H&#8217;s case, his required initial investment was some &#8364;4.08m, with about another &#8364;500k subject to call.</p>

There are further arguments, however, between them about the precise sums that are repayable and how interest and an accounting for H&#8217;s carry receipts from the CF received by him impact upon the calculation.
