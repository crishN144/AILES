	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment concerns an application for costs made by the Official Solicitor (OS) acting as litigation friend for P following judgment on 10 November and an oral hearing on 6 November 2023. The two judgments should be read together.   The application before the court concerned a variation to a statutory will made in 2008 on behalf of P.  It was made by P&#8217;s deputy who is also his brother.  There was no dispute as to the substantive changes to the statutory will by the time of the hearing.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the judgment sets out the only issue for the court was a procedural one.  The deputy disputed the need for notification of beneficiaries under paragraph 9 of Practice Direction (PD) 9E.  The application to the court to resolve that dispute was made by the OS.  The notification dispute arose in relation to two categories of proposed beneficiary under the old and new statutory wills: carers and unidentified charities (&#8216;charity&#8217;).  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The dispute at the hearing centred on the residuary bequest made to unidentified charities (&#8216;charity&#8217;) as set out in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the earlier judgment.  The deputy also argued against the OS that paragraph 9 of PD9E did not apply to the carers as beneficiaries.   The OS accepted by the time of the hearing that there were grounds for dispensing with notification to the carers that would require an order of the court.  </p>

I dispensed with notification to the carers for reasons that were agreed to be compelling.  My reasons are set out in full in my earlier judgment. At paragraph 49 I noted that the deputy had &#8216;fundamentally misunderstood&#8217; the purpose of the service rules. </p>

My earlier judgment reflects that the deputy&#8217;s arguments on the interpretation of PD9E and its application to the carers and charity stretched credulity in some respects.  See paragraphs 42 and 43 of that judgment.  Furthermore, they did not reveal an appreciation that the service requirements are mandatory for the important purposes of procedural fairness and the interests of justice.  They wrongly referred to the &#8216;best interests&#8217; of P as noted in paragraph 20 of my earlier judgment, a point which it appears is still not appreciated by the deputy&#8217;s written submissions (see paragraph 24).  I accepted that there was a compelling reason to dispense with notification of the carers as identified by the OS, and agree in the alternative by the deputy.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, an agreed position could have been adopted on dispensing of notification to the carers prior to the hearing.  An agreed order could have been filed at court setting out the rationale for the orders sought and basis for the agreement, thus avoiding a hearing altogether, subject only to the agreement of the court.  Any hearing called for would have been limited and uncontested.  Indeed, I did question why a hearing was taking place at the outset.  I consider it more likely that the matter would have been dealt with on the papers.  </p>

The deputy for his part alleges that the OS was aggressive and critical and asserts that he has been cordial and cooperative.  The submissions focus on the responsibility and failure to obtain a copy of the statutory will from the relevant bank, and whether or not and when the OS took a &#8216;firm view&#8217; in relation to PD9E requirements.  The OS raises complaints with the bundle provided for the hearing, the lack of compliance with service requirements, and the deputy&#8217;s delays and failure to bring the matter to the court promptly.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">These submissions underline to me the point I have concluded above which is that the deputy has vigorously contested the PD9E notification issue without reasonable regard to PD9E, and existing case law, leading to protracted and perhaps tense correspondence on both sides.   It is not possible for me to determine the level of aggression and criticism between the parties.  There clearly have been frustrated exchanges on both sides for reasons I cannot clearly determine on the papers and which it is neither proportionate nor necessary for present purposes to hold a hearing to determine.  The matters complained of by the OS are illustrative of an approach to the overall conduct of these proceedings by the deputy that have led to there being what I have determined to be an unnecessary contested hearing on what should have been a relatively straightforward issue.  I say nothing about whether the deputy has been aggressive in these proceedings and as noted he disputes any aggression on his part.  </p>

By that stage also a paper determination was not possible as the matter had become highly contentious.</p>
