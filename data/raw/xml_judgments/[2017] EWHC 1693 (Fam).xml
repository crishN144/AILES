This deluge has been caused by the husband's extreme litigation misconduct. In parallel proceedings concerning a bogus loan asserted by his sister he made threats to kill against the wife and her counsel for which he was committed to prison for contempt. In these ancillary relief proceedings he has been removed from the courtroom on at a least one occasion by security staff. He has been repeatedly warned by judges about his unpleasant menacing conduct in court. On one occasion he assaulted the wife's counsel and the wife in court for which he was later convicted of assault in the magistrates' court. He skipped his sentencing hearing and fled abroad from where he has bombarded the court with abusive emails claiming that he has a fatal illness and demanding that the proceedings be adjourned indefinitely. In the course of the proceedings he has entered into a number of transactions designed to defeat the wife's claims.&#8221;</span></p>

Decree nisi amounts to a declaration as to status.  It amounts to a declaration that the parties are the people who are pleaded in the divorce petition and that they were married on the date mentioned in the divorce petition. The husband having petitioned on this basis obviously cannot later be heard to say that he was not the person mentioned in the divorce petition or that he was not the person who was married to the other party mentioned in the divorce petition.  Those are clear declarations as to status which cannot later be impugned.</span></p>

Although it was for him to listen while the claim was opened and argued with him then having the opportunity to respond, he immediately interrupted the proceedings and engaged in a tirade which lasted for some minutes before he &#8216;hung up&#8217; (to speak idiomatically).  In that tirade, which was quite hard to understand but which as will be seen from the transcript of these proceedings I asked counsel and anybody else in Court to give me the sense of what was said, he again engaged in a high degree of abuse and invective and issued the threats of a similar nature to that which I have already mentioned.  The understanding of those who were in Court will be apparent from the transcript of the proceedings, which will be verbatim.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:-0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">So that is the background to the application.  In circumstances where there was an extended civil restraint order in force, this should have been placed on the register of such orders so that when Mr&#160;Veluppillai issued his application in the County Court at Cheltenham and Gloucester and his later applications in the County Court at Central London, that there was an alert automatically sounded and the proceedings should have been automatically dismissed under either Family Procedure Rules Practice Direction 4B 3.3 or Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 3C 3.3 (which is in identical terms).  It is a matter of some concern to me that the resources of the parties and of this Court have been wasted in hearing a fully argued application for a strike out when this should have happened automatically under the terms of the two Practice Directions which I have mentioned.  Attention needs to be given, in my respectful opinion, to putting in place effective machinery whereby there is an up-to-date fully accessible register of all civil restraint orders together with an automatic flagging system when an application is made in breach of that order which brings about automatic dismissal as the terms of the Practice Directions provide.  I will discuss with counsel how these remarks by me might be given more currency, once I have concluded this judgment.</span></p>

They are to be treated as nullities having been made in breach of the permission required.  However, I will go on to consider whether additionally they should be struck out as being abusive.</span></p>

First, they are legally impossible because they are a direct attack on the order made by me which was based on the valid marriage of Mr&#160;Veluppillai to Mrs&#160;Veluppillai.  For the reasons I have given earlier in this judgment, that is a claim which it is impossible for Mr&#160;Veluppillai to make.  He is estopped from making that claim.  Therefore, the basis of the claim is legally impossible.</span></p>

The effect of a general civil restraint order is that unless prior permission is obtained, the party against whom the order is made is restrained from making a claim or any application in any court, whether the High Court or the County Court or the Family Court, because although paragraph 4.2 of Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 3C does not mention the Family Court, by virtue of Family Procedure Rules Practice Direction 4B paragraph 4.2 the power plainly extends to the Family Court in addition.</span></p>

The reason for this is that if it were just in the Civil proceedings issued against the Bank of Scotland and the Chief Land Registrar, then it might be argued that by virtue of Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 3C paragraph 4.2(1) that the order would not extend to the Family Court, whereas there is no such restriction under the corresponding Practice Direction made under the Family Procedure Rules.  It is therefore my opinion that the order, which should be a separate free-standing order to the striking out order which I have made, should be entitled in all three sets of proceedings.</span></p>

However, an indefinite order can be made pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref>, but such an order can only be made on application made by the Attorney General.
