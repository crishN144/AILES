Although the proceedings were begun in the Family Division, prior to the Mental Capacity Act 2005, and have since quite properly continued there, they are of a type that would now be commenced in the Court of Protection. I have, of course, been exercising the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in respect of incapacitated adults.</p>

In relation to each of these judgments there are four things to be noted; first, that the heading in each case included the words &#8220;In Private&#8221;; second, that each judgment was handed down in private (in chambers); third, that I deliberately omitted the rubric on the front sheet which, with minor variations, is conventionally attached to Family Division judgments authorised to be released for publication or report;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

It is not drafted in the way in which injunctions are usually drafted. There is no penal notice. And the procedures required by section 12(3) of the Human Rights Act 1998 and <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Direction 12I: Applications for Reporting Restriction Orders </span>will not have been complied with. But this does not mean that it is unenforceable and of no effect. On the contrary, it is, in my judgment, binding on anyone who seeks to make use of a judgment to which it is attached. And anyone who disobeys it is, in principle, guilty of a contempt of court. This accords with, though it goes a little further than, what is said in paragraph 82 of <span style="font-style:italic">The Family Courts: Media Access &amp; Reporting</span>, published in July 2011.</p>

To publish or report such a judgment without judicial approval is therefore a contempt of court irrespective of whether or not it is in a form which also breaches section 97(2) of the Children Act 1989. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The rubric is in two parts and serves two distinct functions. The first part (&#8220;The judge hereby gives leave for it to be reported&#8221;) has the effect, as it were, of disapplying section 12 <span style="font-style:italic">pro tanto</span>, and thereby immunising the publisher or reporter from proceedings for contempt. But the second part (&#8220;The judgment is being distributed on the strict understanding that &#8230;&#8221;) makes that permission conditional. A person publishing or reporting the judgment cannot take advantage of the judicial permission contained in the first part of the rubric, and will not be immunised from the penal consequences of section 12, unless he has complied with the requirements of the second part of the rubric. This is merely an application of a familiar principle which one comes across in many legal contexts and which finds expression in such aphorisms as that you cannot take the benefit without accepting the burden, that you cannot approbate and reprobate and that if a thing comes with conditions attached you take it subject to those conditions.</p>

Nor is there anything to prevent Mrs B or J or W making whatever use they wish of my judgment <span style="font-style:italic">in the anonymous form in which I gave leave for it to be reported</span>. But what, on this view of the rubric, they cannot do &#8211; and what of course they want to do &#8211; is to link themselves with the judgment; to say that the Mrs B referred to in my judgment is in fact Mrs Brown and that the J and W referred to in the judgment are in fact James and Wilfred Brown (I use pseudonyms to illustrate the point, these are not in fact their true names).&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It will now, I hope, be clear why I deliberately did not include the rubric in any of these judgments. Since section 12 did not apply, there was no need for me to include the first part of the rubric; and absent the first part there was neither need nor justification for the second part.</p>

I am concerned here with proceedings in the Family Division of the High Court. The Court of Protection is governed by its own, materially different, statutory regime: see, for example, in addition to section 12(1)(b) of the 1960 Act, rules 91 and 93 of the Court of Protection Rules 2007, SI, 2007/1744. And the proceedings I am concerned with here are proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction in respect of adults. In ancillary relief and similar types of proceeding there may be other restrictions on publishing or reporting a judgment given in private: see <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allan </span>[2002] EWCA Civ 45, [2002] Fam 261.</p>
