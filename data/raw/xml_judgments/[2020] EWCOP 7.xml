It concerned an application relating to QJ, who is 87 years of age. He is represented by his litigation friend, James Manning, who attended at court on that occasion and, if I may say so, has plainly given the application in this case detailed and anxious consideration.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">QJ has a diagnosis of vascular dementia. Quite what stage that dementia has reached has been the subject of enquiry. CT scans show him to have experienced a number of strokes. He is extremely frail and, as I observed in my earlier judgment, unable to mobilise without assistance. He has lived in care homes since 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2019 and was moved into his present care home on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2019.

Dr A concluded that QJ was able to retain, weigh and communicate that information. He noted that QJ found it difficult to articulate himself and that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he tends to shrug, nod, or shake his head in response to questions as his voice has become dry and croaky due to reduced food and fluid intake.

Dr B provided a detailed and extensive report which covered a range of issues. He noted that QJ has symptoms of vascular dementia which have endured since 2017. He indicates the survival rate for this manifestation of dementia is between five to seven years on average. However, Dr B notes that QJ&#8217;s advanced age and cardiovascular comorbidities, combined with high dependency and poor nutrition, will, in his view, considerably reduce that life expectancy. He expressed the view that the dementia evaluated at &#8220;moderate&#8221; in 2018 is at an &#8220;advanced stage now&#8221;. Dr B expressed that view in clear and unambiguous terms.  </p>

Accordingly, the lawyers required of Dr B a supplementary statement. I express my gratitude to him for his willingness to assist the court and to prepare challenging documentation at short notice.  </p>

It recognises that QJ had previously been assessed as capacitous to take the decisions that the court was being required to consider. As mentioned in my earlier judgment, QJ&#8217;s general practitioner, Dr E, had independently come to the same view as Dr A. Dr B was shown a copy of the report prepared by Dr A setting out the reasoning underpinning his conclusions. It has to be said that when Dr A assessed QJ he was at the care home where he had been residing for some months and, accordingly, in surroundings that are familiar to him. That, coupled with Dr A&#8217;s obvious expertise in supporting QJ&#8217;s decision-taking, created propitious circumstances for promoting QJ&#8217;s capacity.  </p>

He is the clinical lead for dementia at this NHS Trust. He has held his held his current post at the Trust for 20 years and he is consultant in charge of QJ&#8217;s treatment whilst on the ward. He has been involved with the management and care of complex patients with a similar history to that of QJ throughout his entire career as a consultant and prior to that too.

Dr B was, as he records, highly alert to the fact that QJ has a significant cognitive impairment. QJ has, for example, a mental test score of 4/10, which is low, and of course there is the long-standing diagnosis of vascular dementia. He had been admitted with a chest infection, which Dr B observed can itself sometimes affect a patient&#8217;s cognitive state, although he records that the impact of the infection was not obvious when he saw QJ. QJ identified the correct hospital when Dr B asked him where he was. He thought that he had admitted from his home rather than a care home. QJ was asked if he knew why he was in hospital, to which he shook his head and looked at Dr B with what he describes as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a blank expression</span>&#8221;. QJ was prompted by being reminded that he had not been eating or drinking for some time and concerns had been raised about him. He said nothing. When asked if he was hungry, he shook his head. This is a pattern that runs throughout the papers and has been observed by a variety of care home staff and clinicians, as well QJ&#8217;s litigation friend and his solicitor.  </p>

Dr B tested him a little further and asked what would happen to him if he continued to refuse food. Previously, and quite recently, QJ had been able to answer that question, but on this occasion he looked blank, starred back and shrugged his shoulders. Dr B pursued it further and explained to QJ that he was likely to die if he did not eat. Dr B observed that QJ appeared entirely unconcerned, but he also noted that QJ seemed to be fully alert and, although he did not reply, he was looking at his interlocutor.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">One of the options that has been considered is the insertion of a nasogastric (&#8216;NG&#8217;) tube, so it was suggested by Dr B to QJ that this would involve the insertion of a fine tube down his nose that would pass into his stomach to feed him. It was explained that this might improve his condition with regard to food. Dr B explained to QJ that he </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">might experience considerable discomfort in that process and that there would have to be blood tests, to monitor how he reacted to the tube itself and to the feeding. To this QJ showed no reaction. But, when Dr B gestured to indicate a tube going down his nose, QJ shrugged and shook his head. Dr B records that, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">My impression was that he could understand what I was explaining to him</span>.&#8221;  </p>

He gave Dr B the impression that he could not remember any part of what the doctor had said. Dr B reported that QJ gave Dr B no impression that he was able to weigh up the information that he had been given. He would occasionally shake his head, but not verbalise any detail. This led Dr B to come to this conclusion in his supplementary statement:  </p>

It may be that he simply did not want to talk to me but my judgment was that he did not really understand the consequences of his action and could not communicate any view other than by occasionally shaking his head. I did not feel that he had any real depth of understanding of his situation.

It is undoubtedly a difficult situation when an individual suffering from dementia chooses not to respond to certain questions. However, we do know that QJ has chosen not to eat for many weeks. We know that prior to that there had been a significant decline in his food consumption and we know that presently, at hospital, he is taking miniscule amounts of food and Fortisips as well as water.  </p>

Firstly, QJ is, as I have mentioned, accepting the Fortisip. Nobody suggests that this could sustain him long term.

Moreover, the fitting of the tube is highly distressing, extremely invasive and uncomfortable.

Only a percutaneous feeding (&#8216;PEG&#8217;) tube could be fitted. That carries significant risk of morbidity and would provide only a minimal level of nutrition and hydration which would, in effect, achieve nothing in terms of sustaining life for a longer period than the present arrangements. In any event, as Dr B points out, the NICE guidelines for patients living with advanced dementia is that tube feeding should not normally be deployed.  </p>
