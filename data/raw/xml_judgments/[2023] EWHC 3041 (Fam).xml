The respondent to this application is Ms B (&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">the Mother</span>&#8221;).  This judgment is primarily concerned with the question as to whether, given, the highly unusual facts of this case, the Father should be able to return to Ireland with C on an interim basis pending the final hearing of his application for a return order.  I have decided to make an interim return order but would stress that this order is only made because of the very particular and highly unusual facts of this present case.  Even though I have decided to make a return order in this matter, I would stress that this judgment is not intended to give the green light for other parties to make applications for interim return orders in other cases.  An interim return order will be a highly unusual remedy and I have been prepared to make the order here because of the highly unusual facts of this particular case.</p>

C had been living with the Mother and the Father at an address in Ireland and it is common ground that he is and remains habitually resident in Ireland.  The application was supported by a witness statement from Ms Lauren Hall of Osbornes Law who acts in this matter on behalf of the Father.  Ms Hall explained that the Father is a national of a Baltic country who has been habitually resident in Ireland since 2012.  She explains that the Mother is British but was, until recent events, habitually resident in Ireland.  The Mother and the Father married on 10 October 2010 and C was born in Belfast where the couple were living at the time of his birth.  He holds UK citizenship.   They subsequently moved to the Republic of Ireland.  The Mother and the Father separated in about February 2023 but, for a while, they continued to live in the same residence.   </p>

The Applicant Father supported her through this time including arranging for her to see the GP and accessing private therapy, through his work insurance policy. I am instructed that the Mother&#8217;s moods and behaviour gradually became more concerning, and in October/November 2022, the Mother was told by the GP that there was a real possibility she could have psychosis. The Mother was prescribed with anti-psychotics and referred to the Irish Mental Health Services &#8230; . I am instructed that the Father was doing all of the day-to-day caring for C whilst the Mother was dealing with her mental health&#8221;.</span></p>

The Mother was due to have travelled to Dublin with C for a flight on 8 July 2023, but they appear to have missed the flight and travelled to Bristol the following day.  Communication between the Mother and the Father started well but, after a few weeks, the Father became concerned about the arrangements to return C to Ireland to start the new school year, which was due to start on 30 August 2023.  The Father then started to receive some text messages with bizarre wording and became concerned that the Mother&#8217;s mental health was getting worse.  Some of those messages were exhibited to Ms Hall&#8217;s witness statement and they are strongly indicative that the Mother was undergoing a serious mental health crisis.</p>

The Irish social worker got in touch with the child protection department at Bristol City Council (&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">the Local Authority</span>&#8221;) and a welfare check was done over the telephone on 4th September 2023. Although the email reporting back to the Irish social worker, and then passed to the Father, came from a social worker at the Local Authority, it is now clear that she was reporting a conversation that had taken place between a social worker employed by the Local Authority, Mr Gavin Strong, and the Mother.  The Mother explained to Mr Strong that she had moved to Bristol because she believed that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">C was being put in the corner at school and did not have the right teachers</span>&#8221;.  The Mother explained that she was trying to find a school place for C but knew that he would require a psychological and physical assessment.  She explained that she and C were staying in the same room at her mother&#8217;s house but were &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">technically homeless</span>&#8221; and asked for help with finding accommodation.  </p>

My involvement was triggered by a referral raising concerns that B had been verbally abusive to C. The referral described an incident where B had locked C outside and calling him a &#8216;fucking retard&#8217;. I completed a home visit to B and discussed the current situation for B. B explained that she had moved back to England after separating from A. B had not explained that there were any court proceedings ongoing at this point. I completed a mapping with B to ascertain what family members she had to support her and began completing a S.17 assessment to understand C&#8217;s needs and explore support as I felt C was very isolated and vulnerable. Alongside this B had raised concerns about C being sexually abused&#8230;  at his short break, where she had explained that there was an incident where he had stripped. B was able to explain that this had been investigated and no further action was taken. During this visit I was concerned about B&#8217;s mental health, B presented as distrustful and anxious. I had suggested that B goes to the GP around her mental health during this visit.</span></p>

The initial referral from 23.10.23 had mentioned that a member of the household was an archived Registered Sex Offender, but gave no details of his convictions. Disabled children&#8217;s social work team requested more information from the police on 23.10.23 and received a response on 1.11.23. This additional information triggered a strategy discussion on 3.11.23. The outcome of the strategy discussion was to complete Section 47 enquiries to ascertain if C is at risk of, or is likely to experience significant harm whilst in the care of his mother. Currently, a S.47 enquiries and a S.17 assessment are open in relation to C living with his mother at &#8230;</span></p>

I asked B if she was aware of the individual&#8217;s convictions, and she said she was. On the phone, I explained to B that she is not to leave the individual alone with C over the weekend due to the risk. I continued to say that I would visit the family home on 6.11.23 to create a robust safety plan with the family whilst I complete S.47 enquires. B agreed to this and said she understood. However, B cancelled the visit on 6.11.23 with a text reading &#8216;have to. Cancelled 4pm meeting&#8217;. I called B to explained that she has had to take her mum to hospital as she is unwell. B sounded stressed and cut off the line before I could request to complete a visit on 7.11.23. At this point, I understood that this was a stressful situation for B and she had assured me that C was with her in hospital over the phone. Therefore, I responded with a text saying &#8216;Hi B, the purpose of my visit is to safety plan around [name redacted] and assess the level of risk. As well as exploring what other support we can offer. I understand you have to take your mum to hospital, but I need to complete a visit tomorrow. I will come round at 11:00.

I do not need to set those messages out in full in this judgment, but I fully accept that Mr Strong, who is an experienced children&#8217;s disabilities social worker, was fully justified in being very concerned about the content of the messages.

The Mother was served on 25 October 2023 and the matter was first listed before Ms Justice Henke on 3 November 2023 when the Judge made directions.  Those directions were made prior to the events which led to C returning to the care of the Father.   As part of those directions, the Mother agreed to lodge her passports and C&#8217;s passports with her solicitors.  In a normal international custody case, the effect of lodging passports would be that it would not be possible for anyone to remove the child from the United Kingdom.  However, Ireland is part of the UK/Ireland &#8220;Common Travel Area&#8221;.  The Father has retained his passport and thus, in practical terms, I was told that there is nothing preventing the Father from travelling back to Ireland with C as he does not need C&#8217;s passport in order to be able to travel back to Ireland with the child.  I appreciate that the purpose of the passport undertaking, which was given as part of the order of Ms Justice Henke, was to prevent the Mother from taking C to a third country.  It is not clear to me whether it was appreciated at the time that C would not need his passport to travel back to Ireland.</p>

The position of the Father was that he wanted to return home to Ireland with his son for multiple reasons.  He was absent from work whilst in England and was living with his son in a hotel room in a modest hotel.  His son has special educational and psychological support needs which he could not fulfil in England because C was not able to access specialist services whilst living in Bristol.  However, whilst acknowledging the strong opinions of her client, his counsel was initially reluctant for me to make an interim return order as she appeared to be concerned that seeking such an order would breach her duties to the court because such an order was wrong in principle, especially given the difficulties in the Mother&#8217;s participation and absence of any evidence from the Mother.  Whilst, in the end, I disagreed with counsel for the Father, I acknowledge that she was acting entirely properly in drawing the court her reservations about the order she was instructed to seek on behalf of her client.</p>

I heard some evidence from the social worker, Mr Strong, and then adjourned for about 2 hours to give Mr Barwell O&#8217;Connor an opportunity to take instructions from his client before cross examining Mr Strong.  Unfortunately, the effect of the social work evidence was to upset the Mother so much that she was unable to give Mr Barwell O&#8217;Connor any instructions.  He could not therefore proceed with cross examination and could only request a further adjournment and invited me not to make any order relating to an interim return until he was able to cross examine Mr Strong.  Unfortunately, it became clear that this would necessitate an adjournment of some weeks and possibly into January 2024 when the intermediary would be available.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">The position of the Local Authority was firmly that the present arrangements were unsustainable even in the short term and that C should return to Ireland.  Mr Strong gave clear and compelling evidence about the shortfalls of the present situation.  He was clearly very concerned about the Mother&#8217;s mental health but was also concerned that he had reached an agreement with her that she would not leave C alone with her brother, on the grounds that he was a registered sex offender, and yet had found C alone with the brother when he made an unannounced visit only a few days later.  Mr Strong explained to me that, prior to these events, he had information about C and his parents but he rapidly realised that this was a mother who, as a result of her mental health difficulties, was struggling to meet the needs of her child.  He said he was concerned that, on 10 November, the bizarre and sexually charged text messages from the Mother meant that, at that point, there were risks to C in being in his Mother&#8217;s care.  He said that, since C had been placed with the Father, he had supervised a contact session with the Mother on 21 November 2023 and she had appeared to be significantly better than she had been when he saw her on 10 November 2023 but, given her fluctuating mental health condition, he would still be concerned about any proposal to return C to his Mother&#8217;s care.  </p>

This is not, I stress, either a matter of reaching adverse judgments about the Mother or blaming her.  I am acutely conscious that she appears to be having a serious mental health breakdown and is in need of professional mental health support.  I also express no views at all about the extent to which she is a competent and caring parent at times when she is not suffering from a mental health crisis, but the evidence shows that, at this time, there are sufficient concerns about the Mother&#8217;s ability to parent C that it would not be appropriate to return C to her care.</p>

He said that the Father had shown that he understood C&#8217;s needs and was honest about how difficult it was for C living in a hotel.  Mr Strong explained that the past few months had been really difficult for C because, as a child with autism, he needed structure and routine in order to feel safe and that all this had been taken away from him.  Mr Strong said he was concerned that C was isolated in Bristol because he was away from his peers and everything that was usual for him.  His firm conclusion was that the Father was doing his best in very difficult circumstances, but it would be far better for C to be allowed to return to the structure and routine he had in Ireland before he was abducted.</p>

The head explained the school&#8217;s approach to support C, as a largely non-verbal child with significant autism.  He explained the speech and language therapy and occupational therapy support that was available to C as well as activities to promote his learning and development.  Mr Strong expressed the view that these appeared to him, as a social worker specialising in disabled children, to be an entirely appropriate package of measures.  The school head also explained that C has access to day care support which he enjoys.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Mr Strong said that the school head explained that places at specialist schools in Ireland were in huge demand and that the system in Ireland was that places were held open for 28 days if a child was not attending but, after 28 days, the place could be reallocated to another child on a permanent basis.  He was told that C&#8217;s place had technically lapsed because he had been absent for more than 28 days and there were other children who could be allocated the place.  However, to date, no allocation had been made and so C would be able to return to the school if he were to return shortly.  However, his school place could be re-allocated to another child at any time and the overall impression I got from his evidence is that it would, in all probability, be lost if C failed to return shortly.  Mr Strong was asked what steps could be taken in England to replicate the type of support that C was getting in Ireland.  He said that the route to accessing special educational support in England was through the Education, Health and Care Plan (&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">EHCP</span>&#8221;) process and that securing the necessary assessments to produce an EHCP plan would involve a number of different professionals and, due to pressures on the system, would take a period of months.  Then, once an EHCP plan had been produced, it would be necessary to identify a placement that was able to provide the proper level of support for C and to allocate the resources necessary to support that placement.  That is sadly a long process that takes many months.</p>

I consider that, as far as possible, the Local Authority should allocate its limited stock of residential property in accordance with the needs of those who are seeking its assistance and not by reference to who has or has not secured court orders.  In my judgment, it would not be right to require the Local Authority to allocate accommodation to the Father and C in preference to other families with greater needs because that would, in effect, involve queue jumping.  </p>

The Mother's evidence could not be prepared until an intermediary was involved and thus, in practice, the Mother would not be in a position to serve her evidence in reply until early 2024.  She has also asked for a psychiatrist to be appointed to provide a report on the Mother&#8217;s mental health.  I agreed to that appointment and it was indicated that a report could be obtained relatively quickly, in approximately two weeks.</p>

However, Lady Hale confirmed that the courts of the place of the child&#8217;s presence were able to use the powers under articles 7(3) and 11 of the 1996 Convention to make orders where these were necessary for the child&#8217;s welfare and that they could be classified as urgently needed orders.  Lady Hale confirmed that any welfare orders made in respect of a child by this Court, acting as a court of a secondary jurisdiction, will be enforceable in the home state under part IV of the 1996 Convention.  However, orders made by this Court, as a court with secondary jurisdiction, will lapse once orders are made by the Courts in the home state:  see article 11(3).

Article 3 of the 1980 Convention defines the meaning of a &#8220;wrongful&#8221; retention as a retention which is in breach of the rights of custody of the left-behind parent under the laws of the state of habitual residence of the child.  Rights of custody are widely defined in article 5 to include &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the child&#8217;s place of residence</span>&#8221;.   There is nothing in the 1980 or the 1996 Conventions to suggest that the rights of custody of the left-behind parent are suspended by the wrongful act of the abducting parent or by the act of the left behind parent in commencing proceedings seeking a return order and, on the contrary, the whole purpose of the Conventions was to uphold parental rights.  It thus appears to me that the Father&#8217;s parental rights under Irish law (and for domestic purposes his parental rights and responsibilities under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>) remain in force even though he has brought these proceedings.</p>

However, this is a highly unusual case because the child protection authorities in the state to which the abducting parent has travelled have intervened on welfare grounds to take the child away from the abducting parent and have only refrained from taking child protection proceedings because the left behind parent, namely the Father, was prepared to travel from Ireland to Bristol and to resume caring for C.

The Father would not be &#8220;abducting&#8221; C within the meaning of the 1980 Convention because he would taking the child back to his place of habitual residence.  He would therefore not be breaching the Mother&#8217;s rights of custody under Irish law.  Further, by commencing these proceedings, in my judgment the Father cannot be taken to have given any form of implied undertaking that he would not return to Ireland with the child absent either a court order or the Mother&#8217;s consent.  If, after he had commenced proceedings, instead of the Local Authority becoming involved, members of the Mother&#8217;s family had realised that the Mother was unable to care for C and that the child needed specialist support, and they had contacted the Father and asked him to collect C, the Father would not have been acting unlawfully in coming to Bristol to collect his son and taken him home to Ireland.  He would simply have been exercising his parental rights in a responsible way notwithstanding the fact that no return order had been made in the proceedings.</p>

That is possible because of the Common Travel Area.

Instead, he has stayed in Bristol with C and taken a full part in the legal process.

In the highly unusual circumstances of this case, in my judgment the first issue to consider is whether to continue to require the Father to give an undertaking that he will not return to Ireland with C.  Given that, absent his undertaking, he is lawfully able to return with C, it seems to me that the question of an interim order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref> is, in fact, wholly unnecessary.  The Father has said that, if he is allowed to return to live with C in Ireland whilst these proceedings are being considered, he is prepared to give undertakings (a) to return C to the UK if his application for a return order is refused and (b) that, pending the resolution of the proceedings in this court, he will not make any application to the Courts in Ireland in relation to C.  </p>

However, the defence under article 13(b) is not that a return would be intolerable for the Mother but that it would be intolerable for the child.  Thus, assuming that the Mother sticks to her stated intention not to return to Ireland, the high point of the Mother&#8217;s case is:</p>

I cannot resolve that issue and so will assume that the Mother would be able to show that she has been C&#8217;s primary carer, save for periods when she has been unable to do so because of her own mental health.  However, in assessing intolerability, I must ask whether it would be intolerable for C to return to Ireland during the period of time prior to the child&#8217;s welfare being the subject of a decision of the Court in Ireland.  These are summary proceedings and, of course, it is very difficult to judge the Mother&#8217;s case in advance of the Mother&#8217;s evidence but, on this aspect of the case, the key evidence is not about how the Mother feels but about how things would be for C if he were to return with the Father and the Mother were to stay in England.  There is no indication at all from Mr Strong that C is reacting adversely to being cared for almost exclusively by his Father, even in the wholly artificial environment of a hotel, and only with limited supervised contact with his mother.  The evidence of this highly experienced social worker who specialises in supporting disabled children is that returning C to Ireland where he would be able to resume his place at the specialist school is very much in his best interests.  That evidence must mean that his assessment is that a return would be very far from being intolerable for C.  In the context of the particular facts of this case, that is strong evidence to rebut any intolerability case.</p>

He is not getting that in England and further, it seems that whatever the Mother might say, C will not get that support in the medium term if he stays in England.  In contrast, he would have stability and specialist support in Ireland.  Further, if he does not return at this time, his place at the specialist school is in jeopardy and thus, even if the Father wins this case, he may return in February to find that C has lost his place at the specialist school and has to start the difficult process of trying to find a new specialist place, no doubt in competition with other parents who are looking for support for their own children.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">In the circumstances of the case, I have to ask what evidence the Mother could possibly advance, along the lines set out in her Answer, which could surmount the high hurdle of showing that it would be intolerable for C to return to Ireland.  C would, of course, lose regular face to face contact with his mother although electronic contact arrangements could no doubt be put in place and some form of irregular face to face contact may be possible.  However, taking account of all the evidence set out above, in my judgment, given the shape of the case that the Mother has set out in her Answer, I cannot envisage any evidence that the Mother could possibly advance that would show that there was a seriously arguable case that the high threshold of intolerability will be met.  No evidence from the Mother can overcome the problem that C needs specialist educational and psychological support and, in the period between now and the conclusion of a welfare court case in Ireland, that support is only available to C in Ireland.   It is plainly in C&#8217;s best interests to be able to access the specialist support that he needs and this support is only available in Ireland.  He would, of course, gain benefit from contact with both of his parents, but in my judgment it is far more important for him to have that specialist support, with the support of one parent in person and one parent electronically, as opposed to the possibility and perhaps even the probability of losing that specialist support at The specialist school and having to start again trying to find specialist support in either England or Ireland.  I thus reject the idea that the Mother has any realistic prospect of being able to show that a return would be intolerable for C.</p>

However, the response states &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the child may object to a return</span>&#8221;.  Hence, at this stage, the Mother is not able to advance a case that C is actively voicing objections, only that he may do so.  C is nearly 11 and so may well be of an age where, with other children, any objections would be carefully considered.  Mr Strong&#8217;s evidence is that C&#8217;s disabilities mean that he is largely non-verbal but he is missing the day care support that he accessed in Ireland and has communicated that he cannot understand why he is unable to access it.  That goes against any suggestion of child objections.  However, even if it were possible to interpret C&#8217;s limited communications as amounting to a level which meant they amounted to objections to returning to Ireland, it seems to me inevitable that only limited weight could be given to them given C&#8217;s disabilities and given the countervailing consideration that the specialist support he needs is only available in Ireland.</p>

Mr Barwell O&#8217;Connor argues that there is a real risk that the Father will breach his undertakings not to commence proceedings in Ireland and that, once the Irish courts are seized of the matter, they may make orders which will prevent the Father returning C to England.   I have analysed the law below but, for the purposes of an interim injunction, I accept that this is a theoretical risk.  However, in my judgment, the risk that the Father will breach his undertakings must be relatively small and, even if he were to do so, it must be relatively unlikely that the Irish court will override a carefully set balancing position which allowed C to return on an interim basis against solemn promises by the Father that he would be returned if the English courts ruled against his application for a return order.  Nonetheless, I accept that this has to be a factor in the balance of convenience.  </p>

In my judgment, those factors far outweigh the risk that the Father will breach his undertakings.  Accordingly, if I were to be wrong in reaching the decision that the Mother will be unable to raise a seriously arguable case, given the undertakings offered by the Father, I would have refused to grant an injunction to prevent the Father exercising his parental rights by returning to Ireland prior to any final hearing of this matter.  It follows that, I accept the undertakings that the Father has offered and release the Father from his undertaking not to return to Ireland with C pending the final hearing.

His case was that, even if such an order was supported by an undertaking by the Father to return the child pending a further hearing, it was wrong in principle because, once the child was returned to Ireland, the child was effectively beyond the jurisdiction of this court and hence making an interim return order would take effect as a final order albeit one that was purportedly made on an interim basis.  He submits that, if an interim return order were to be made, no undertaking by the Father to return the child to the UK in the event that this court rules in favour of the Mother would be enforceable in Ireland because, once the child was physically returned, the Irish courts could, upon an application by the father, resume exclusive jurisdiction over the child arrangements and could make a welfare order to prevent the child returning back to the UK.  He also submits that, even if no such order is made, any undertaking offered by the Father would only be enforceable in the courts in England and Wales and, if the Father were to stay in Ireland, he would be immune from any action to enforce the undertaking.</p>

Counsel for the Father said her client was desperate to return to Ireland, but she was concerned that any interim order could not properly be made at this stage for the reasons that the Mother&#8217;s counsel has advanced and that, to do so, before the Mother had filed any evidence would be a clear breach of the Mother's rights under article 6 ECHR.  She was thus concerned that any interim order made at this stage would be overturned by the Court of Appeal and that the delay caused by an appeal would ultimately mean that it would be even longer before her client was able to secure a return for C to Ireland.  She was therefore, on instructions, initially inclined to agree directions which would have the effect of requiring the Father to remain in hotel accommodation in Bristol until the final hearing, which she hoped would be able to be moved to January from the present proposed dates in February.  However, after obtaining further instructions, she sought an interim return order given her client&#8217;s clear concerns for C&#8217;s welfare.</p>

On the contrary, I accept that the undertakings given by the Father (a) to return C to the UK if his application for a return order is refused and (b) that, pending the resolution of the proceedings in this court, he will not make any applications to the Courts in Ireland in relation to C are protective measures which can be enforced by the courts in Ireland under the terms of the 1996 Convention unless and until the Irish courts take it upon themselves to make welfare orders relating to C.  </p>

There would, accordingly, be a strong case that any such application would be an abuse of process.  Further, if that were to happen, the Father could be punished by this court for breach of his undertaking.  Nonetheless, I accept that, if this were to happen and the Irish court agreed that it should assume jurisdiction and make welfare orders relating to C, this court would effectively be prevented from further considering whether to make a return order.  That is a factor which, in my judgment, would prevent an interim return order in many cases.

That form of wording suggests that if there is any conflict between the provisions in Part 1 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref> and the 1980 Convention, the terms of Part 1 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref> have precedence.  Thus, in my judgment, the wide words in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> allowing the court to make orders in the welfare interests of a child where it considers it is appropriate to do so should not be curtailed by reference to the provisions of the 1980 Convention;</p>

Thus, the only way I can give interim directions to achieve the statutory objective is to make an interim return order and, if I refuse to make that order, I will be acting directly contrary to C&#8217;s welfare.  I do not consider that it would be right to interpret the powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> in a way that runs directly contrary to the child&#8217;s welfare.  If there were to be any concern that this construction could conflict with the scheme of the Convention, the width of the powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> cannot be cut down for the reason set out at paragraph (a) above;</p>

Thus, far from conflicting with the aims of the 1980 Convention, on these particular facts the making of an interim return order supports the purposes of the 1980 Convention;</p>

Article 18 provides &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">The provisions of this Chapter do not limit the power of a judicial or administrative authority to order the return of the child at any time</span>&#8221;.

In my judgment, an interim return to Ireland is in the interests of the child because that is the only place that will give C the stability and support that, as a disabled child, he so badly needs and that delaying a return is likely to inimical to his best interests for the reasons set out above.</p>

However, this is a highly unusual case on its facts and is one where I am satisfied that an interim return order is both appropriate and necessary to protect C&#8217;s welfare.  It follows that, I consider that it is open to me to accept the Father&#8217;s undertakings and to make an interim return order and, if it were to be necessary, I would have been prepared to do so.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Given the difficulties in this case, if this matter has to proceed to a final trial, I cannot see this case being finally resolved until February 2024 at the earliest.  Further, on the basis of the Mother&#8217;s present Answer, it seems to me almost inevitable that her case will fail.  I have however further reflected on whether it would be a breach of the Mother&#8217;s right to a fair trial to reach a final decision against her when (a) she has failed to put in any evidence and (b) the reason that she has failed to do so is a direct result of her mental health disabilities.  Whilst I consider that her case is almost certainly bound to fail on the basis of her Answer, on further reflection I am concerned that she may well not have been well enough to give full instructions to her solicitors and thus, assuming she is able to recover over the next month and receives help from an intermediary, it is just possible that her case will look somewhat different once she is able to formulate it with a good deal of help.  She has also heard the evidence of Mr Strong which clearly upset her but, once she has had the chance to consider it, may reflect on whether she wishes to press ahead with her resistance to this application or is prepared to negotiate a voluntary return for C to Ireland until the Irish courts can make a decision on his eventual welfare.</p>

Although these issues could be considered to raise a number of novel points which could, on a case with the right facts, merit permission to appeal, I refuse permission to appeal because, on the facts of this case I consider that (a) the welfare arguments in favour of an interim return are overwhelming (either by releasing the Father from his undertaking or by way of a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> order) and (b) that it would undermine the policy of the 1980 and 1996 Conventions to impose such limitations on the Court so that it could not make orders when these were so plainly needed on the facts of this individual case.</p>

Nonetheless, I have indicated that I will delay releasing the Father from the terms of his non-return undertaking until midnight on Friday 2 December 2023 to allow a short period of time for the Mother&#8217;s legal team to reflect on their position and, if so advised, to apply for permission to appeal. During that period, as directed at the hearing, the Father and C shall be accommodated by the Local Authority either voluntarily or by an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 5</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref>. I understand that arrangements have been made at the Court of Appeal for urgent consideration of applications in Hague return cases and so I hope that it will not be necessary for any application to be made to extend that timetable.  Any such application can be made to me or to the Court of Appeal although I would be cautious about any further extension because any further delay may result in the loss of the  specialist school place, which it seems to me to be hugely important to retain if at all possible.</p>
