Her Nepalese adoption was recognised under the common law by McDonald J on 10 October 2016. On that day he made orders providing for O to live with her father in Dubai and for her to have contact with her mother. The wardship for three days in January 2019 arose when the mother retained O after a period of contact.  </p>

However, an agreement was reached between the parties that the court did have jurisdiction not only under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2(1)</ref>(b)(i) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> in circumstances where there were recently concluded divorce proceedings here, but also under article 12(3) of Council Regulation No. 2201/200 (&#8220;Brussels 2&#8221;). The latter basis of jurisdiction was established by virtue of the mother being habitually resident here; O being a British citizen; the parties expressly accepting the jurisdiction of the court; and it being in O&#8217;s best interests for the court here to exercise jurisdiction over her. </p>

At some point in 2016 the wardship was discharged; the date is unclear to me. On 10 October 2016 Macdonald J gave an extensive judgment in which he navigated formidable legal obstacles on the way to his conclusion that the adoption could be validly recognised at common law. He further made a declaration under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/57" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 57</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> that O was the adopted child of the mother and father.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">That order remains in force, although its status is somewhat uncertain. As I will explain, there is no jurisdiction in this case for this court to entertain any child arrangements dispute of any nature, and that want of jurisdiction extends, for sure, to any application to discharge or vary the residence or contact terms in the order of 10 October 2016. Further, on 4 December 2020 this court issued a certificate under article 41(1) and (2) recording the contact terms in the order of 10 October 2016, notwithstanding that the father was not heard on that occasion, and O was not given an opportunity to be heard. According to article 41, once the certificate has been issued, the rights of access shall be recognised and enforceable in another member state, in this case Ireland, without any possibility of the father opposing recognition. A mysterious aspect of this procedure is that there is no reference within it to the ability of the court in the other member state to vary the contact terms if the welfare of the child requires this. In this case, therefore, a literal interpretation of the regulation leads to the conclusion that the contact terms seem to be written in stone and are incapable of being varied either in England or in Ireland no matter how clamant a need for change might be. </p>

The reason that there have been so many case management hearings is because of difficulties in serving the father. He says that he did not receive any of the documents sent to him by email and the first that he knew about the proceedings was when he received some documents in the post on 9 December 2020. The mother says that this is entirely untrue; he was well aware of the proceedings but chose to ignore them. It is not necessary for me to decide this dispute. </p>

A simple example is that provided by Article 12 of BIIa, namely where the parents agree to the courts of England and Wales exercising parental responsibility jurisdiction when this is "connected" with the divorce proceedings. I certainly have experience of cases in which parents wanted proceedings concerning their child or children to be determined in England rather than the country in which they lived. There might be a number of reasons for this and, in my view, it would be regrettable if there was not scope to accommodate at least this type of case. This would, of course, be subject to the provisions of BIIa or the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention ("the 1996 Convention"), but the fact that habitual residence is, for good reason, the core basis of jurisdiction does not, in my view, mean there is not a legitimate place for the jurisdiction provided by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 2(1)</ref>(b)(i).&#8221; </p>

In the light of the Explanatory Note to the Rules introducing the amendments consequent on Brussels II Revised, a purposive construction of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 2(1)</ref>(b)(i) would support an interpretation of the provisions bringing it into line with the provisions of Brussels II Revised, and away from the UK based "continuing proceedings" jurisdiction. The time frame of the revoked FPR 2.40 is similar to the time frame for continuing jurisdiction based on divorce in Brussels II and Article 12 of Brussels II Revised. In my judgment to fall within the residual jurisdiction there must be proximity between the divorce proceedings and the court being asked to determine a question of making an order in relation to children. In any case it may be that essentially the same application or issue has been before the court, unresolved, for some time, but once an order has been made, then in my view the connection with the matrimonial proceedings would terminate.&#8221;  </p>

The mother cannot honestly assert that she made the application in relation to O because 6&#189; years earlier she was divorced from the father. The marriage and its dissolution have absolutely nothing to do with the present dispute. </p>

However, there were five case management orders made after the application was issued and each of these orders  stated on its face that it was made in the High Court. None of the first four orders provided for a transfer of the application to the High Court. Three of them were made by deputies who did not have the power to transfer a case to the High Court (see r.29.17 (3) and (4)). Each of these orders therefore contained an error as to which court the case was proceeding in. Each of those orders should have been headed &#8220;In the Family Court&#8221; and should have recorded that the application was proceeding in the Family Court at High Court judge level.  </p>
