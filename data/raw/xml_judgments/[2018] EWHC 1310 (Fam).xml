	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> On 1 May 2018, sitting at Nottingham, I allowed an appeal against a suspended committal order made by a recorder sitting in the family court following the appellant&#8217;s failure to comply with an earlier order which required her to make her daughter available for contact with the respondent to this appeal. This judgment sets out the reasons for my decision.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The proceedings concern a little girl, hereafter referred to as E, now aged rising 5. Throughout her life, E has lived with her mother, the appellant in this case. E&#8217;s father died in 2014. Both of E&#8217;s paternal grandparents &#8211; her grandmother, C, and grandfather, G &#8211; are still alive, but are no longer in a relationship. Indeed, it is clear from court documents I have seen, and their conduct during the hearing before me, that relations between them are extremely poor. It seems that, for a while after her father&#8217;s death, E was having contact with her paternal grandmother C, and her current partner, P.  That broke down in circumstances that are disputed between the parties. The mother alleges that C abused her own children, including E&#8217;s father, when they were young, and in making these allegations has been supported by the grandfather, G. C denies these allegations, and instead asserts that the mother only stopped contact after C and P reported concerns to social services about the mother&#8217;s partner. I am not in a position to decide where the truth lies in these cross-allegations, and it is unnecessary for me to resolve them for the purposes of this appeal.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Towards the end of 2016, C and P applied for permission to apply for a child arrangements order so that they could resume contact with E. The application was opposed by the mother but permission was granted, and the application for a child arrangements order was listed for a contested hearing before justices sitting in the family court on 21 July 2017. At the conclusion of the hearing, the justices made an order for contact. In the reasons for their decision, they concluded that &#8220;it was appropriate for the paternal grandparents to have time with their granddaughter&#8221;. The mother and G have objected strongly to the use of the phrase &#8220;paternal grandparents&#8221; to mean C and P, when P is, in fact, not her grandparent. The order drafted immediately after the hearing provided that C should have contact every Sunday, in a two-weekly cycle, week one from 12 noon to 2pm and week two from 12 noon to 5pm. The sealed version of the order, however, provided that both C and P should have contact at those times. This difference has also been the cause of grievance between the parties and was the subject of an application some months later to amend the order as described below which led to a third version of the order. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother appealed against the order and also filed a further application for another child arrangements order, effectively to supersede the first order. Shortly before the hearing of the appeal, G applied for permission to intervene in the proceedings to support the mother. The appeal was listed before HH Judge Lea on 14 September 2017. At the start of the hearing, the judge refused G&#8217;s application, whereupon both G and C left the court. The judge proceeded to consider C&#8217;s application for permission to appeal against the order of 21 July. He dismissed the application and ordered C to pay the respondents&#8217; costs on the sum of &#163;1,320. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 26 October 2017, C filed an application for an enforcement order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.11</ref>J of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. The application was listed for a hearing before a deputy district judge. Shortly before the hearing, the mother filed an application to set aside Judge Lea&#8217;s order dismissing her application for permission to appeal. At the hearing on 14 December 2017, the deputy district judge dismissed that application, recording on the face of his order that the mother had admitted that she had failed to comply with the order of 21 July but wished to advance reasons for her non-compliance which needed to be determined by the court as to whether they amounted to a reasonable excuse within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.11</ref>J(3) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. He therefore listed the application for an enforcement order on 20 February 2018, the purpose of the hearing being described in the order as &#8220;to determine whether the mother had a reasonable excuse for failing to comply with the order of 21 July 2017&#8221;.</p>

Her grounds of appeal and skeleton argument raised a number of complaints, including that C had abused her own child and was a risk to E; that the order of 21 July 2017 had been defective because it had referred to P as a paternal grandparent; that evidence was withheld from the court in July 2017 by the Cafcass officer. The mother also said that she was a litigant in person who did not understand court workings, that she had been refused legal aid, was &#8220;the equivalent of a 10-year-old&#8221;, and dependent on the support of G to assist her in the case. The mother, assisted by G, also filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal. After discussions between the two appeal offices and judges in both courts, it was confirmed that the appeal lay to the High Court rather than the Court of Appeal. Directions were therefore given for a hearing of the appeal in Nottingham. </p>

Although the statement filed on 3 January had stated that only a robust order would succeed in making the mother comply with the order and had invited the court to make a suspended committal order, I accept the appellant&#8217;s submission that she did not have proper notice of the committal application. It was for that reason that her pro bono barrister did not attend the hearing. The only application filed and served on the appellant was an application for an enforcement order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.11</ref>I.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, and following on from the first error, neither of the requirements of rule 37.10(3) was satisfied. The appellant did not receive an application identifying, &#8220;separately and numerically, each alleged act of contempt including, if known, the date of each of the alleged acts&#8221;, nor did the respondent file an affidavit in support. Furthermore, there was a failure to comply with several of the provisions of Practice Direction 37A. The application served on the appellant did not contain a warning as required by paragraph 10.2(4) and the Annex thereto. As no notice of application to commit was served on the appellant, it follows that she accordingly had no time to prepare a defence or respond in any other way, as required by paragraph 12.5(1). There is nothing to indicate that she was made aware of the possible availability of criminal legal aid, or how to contact the Legal Aid Agency, or given any other opportunity to obtain legal advice, as required by paragraph 12.5(2) and (3).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, although the recorder caused an order to be drawn in form N79 setting out the contempts which she purported to find proved, her judgment &#8211; if indeed it can be properly so described &#8211; did not adequately set out the breaches she found proved, nor her rationale for making a committal order as opposed to alternative orders for enforcement of the child arrangements order. Although she alluded to &#8220;community service&#8221;, she plainly did not give sufficient consideration to the making of an enforcement order which was, in fact, the order for which the respondent had applied. It is well-recognised that a committal order should be regarded as a remedy of last resort in these sensitive cases, and the recorder should have given far greater consideration to the alternatives. But in truth, she should not have got as far as even considering committal, because no such application was before the court. </p>

There is nothing in the papers that I have read to suggest that the recorder addressed this issue. Even if she had done so, I am confident that she could not reasonably have concluded that no injustice had been caused to the appellant by the manifold defects in the commencement and conduct of the committal application.</p>

In saying that, I am not endorsing the appellant&#8217;s actions. It seems plain that she has failed to comply with the order of 21 July 2017. But the fact that a party has failed to comply with an order does not empower the court to make a committal order without complying with the procedural requirements. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is another matter which I raised with the parties in the course of the hearing, namely whether the order of 21 July 2017 was one which was capable of being enforced by committal at all. As set out above, an order can only be enforced by committal if endorsed with a penal notice that complies with FPR rule 37.9(1) and paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 of Practice Direction 37A. The notice contained in the various iterations of the order of 21 July 2017 did not comply with those provisions. The notice on the front of the order handed down after the hearing did not state, in terms, that disobedience of the order would be a contempt of court which could be punishable by imprisonment. Instead, it stated (in bold typeface) that &#8220;if you do not do what the child arrangements order says you may be sent to prison and/or fined, made to do unpaid work or pay financial compensation&#8221;. The sealed version of the order subsequently served also included those words on the front of the order on the front of the order but in ordinary font as opposed to bold typeface. The sealed order did contain a notice that.stated &#8220;if you do not comply with the provisions of this order you may be held in contempt of court and be committed to prison or fined&#8221;, but that notice was on the second page of the order, not on the front.</p>

But in doing so I invited Mr Michael Rimer, the senior lawyer at the agency who has been of considerable assistance in a number of other cases before this court in which issues concerning public funding have arisen, to join the hearing by telephone for a preliminary discussion before I considered the substantive issue.

He pointed out that the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bunning</span> was of no assistance to committal applications in the county or family courts, and that the agency had therefore devised processes for granting representation in committal proceedings in those courts administered by its office in Nottingham. Where the agency came across instances where the High Court had made a grant of criminal legal aid after <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bunning</span>, its practice has been to substitute that grant with its own grant of representation and treat the High Court's order as a clear indication that legal aid should be granted in that particular case.  Mr Rimer added that, since May 2015, the team in Nottingham had received and granted criminal legal aid in 130 High Court committal matters out of a total of 1,804 applications for legal aid arising out of contempt matters. He drew attention to guidance available at <a class="Hyperlink" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/620018/civil-contempt-guidance.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/620018/civil-contempt-guidance.pdf</a>. </p>

If the Legal Aid Agency wishes to challenge that line of authority, I respectfully suggest that it must identify a suitable case in which to do so. I merely record that the agency now has a department in Nottingham which specialises in considering applications for legal aid in committal cases. Mr Rimer told me that the unit was accustomed to processing such applications promptly, given the urgency which often arises in committal cases. It may be, therefore, that in future a litigant who finds himself or herself in a similar position as the appellant in this case would be better advised in the first instance to apply to the agency for public funding. In the event that the application is unsuccessful or delayed, the matter should be raised with the court.</p>
