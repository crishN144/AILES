In the light of this failure to co-operate with the preparation of the earlier report District Judge Dowding again ordered X City Council to prepare a report; the mother was ordered to attend appointments and to make J available for the necessary inquiries. The matter was listed for further directions on 8 June 2012, the mother was ordered to attend, and once again the orders were reinforced by the making of penal notices.</p>

A port alert was made, J was made a ward of court as was an order granting the father parental responsibility.  The Guardian was appointed shortly thereafter to represent J.</p>

The grandfather asked for the outcome of the DNA test and it was explained to him that it was not possible to tell him as this was information private to the mother.  The grandfather told MC that on the day of the DNA test, they had heard that the grandmother had died and that the mother had returned to the Congo for the funeral.  He went on to say that the mother had not yet returned because they had been involved in a road accident and that J had been in hospital before dying of her injuries.  When asked by MC for written confirmation that this was the case the grandfather said he would provide e-mail evidence of the grandmother's death.</p>

They were involved in a road traffic accident which resulted in J being thrown either through the windscreen or out of the car, she sustained fatal head injuries.  J was taken, initially, to one hospital and then onwards to a second hospital where she died.  The mother says she was separated from J as she herself had been injured and was subsequently informed of her death and saw her body.  (It should be noted that elsewhere in the papers, in a statement made by the mother only a few months after J&#8217;s alleged death, the mother says that in fact she was sitting in the back seat and not the front seat of the car.)</p>

By consent, an order was made on 13 November 2012 granting leave for the passport to be released, on the basis that the passport would be returned to the guardian within three days of the mother&#8217;s return to England.  </p>
