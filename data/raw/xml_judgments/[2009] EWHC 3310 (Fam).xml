I am inclined to think that normally it would be appropriate for there to be an oral hearing at the first annual review but that if the position at that stage seems to have stabilised and the circumstances are such that change is unlikely within the next year the next and subsequent reviews can probably take place without an oral hearing. This must always, of course, be subject to the right of any party, or, indeed, of the judge (who has an important role to play in this respect), to require that there should in fact be an oral hearing if it appears, for example, that the evidence requires further investigation or scrutiny (whether by cross-examination or by directing further investigations or assessments) or that there are matters on which the court would be assisted by argument.&#8221;</p>

Mr Crabtree suggests that quarterly reviews may suffice. Particularly in the early months and years I would incline to agree with Mr O&#8217;Brien, but I would also agree with Mr Crabtree that one cannot be too prescriptive. As he rightly says, the review structure must always be specifically tailored to the needs of the individual to whom it applies.&#8221;</p>

On the basis of written submissions I made an order on 4 July 2008 continuing the previous interim regime pending a further review fixed for 25 July 2008. Following a hearing on the latter date &#8211; the final hearing in the sense in which I had used that phrase in the judgment &#8211; I made a further order, continuing the previous regime and providing for a further review in May 2009. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the event the May 2009 review had to be postponed. I was kept informed of developments. Moreover, as Ms Waldman on behalf of the local authority points out, the local authority was throughout continuing to hold regular internal reviews and the restrictions on BJ in relation to deprivation of liberty, residence and contact were considered at each review. If it had been considered necessary, either the local authority or the Official Solicitor could have applied to the court for an urgent hearing, but neither considered it necessary, both being satisfied (and, in my judgment, correctly satisfied) that the existing regime at MH continued to meet BJ&#8217;s best interests. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I emphasise the point, because in this case, as I have said, it is conceded that the regime which I have approved for BJ involves a deprivation of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5. And where in a case such as this there is a deprivation of liberty, regular reviews by the court are not merely desirable, not merely a matter of good practice; they go, as both the Strasbourg jurisprudence and the domestic case-law make clear, to the very <span style="font-style:italic">legality</span> of what is being done.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since the hearing in July 2008 the local authority as I have said have held regular reviews. Initially they took place generally on a bi-monthly cycle (meetings on 23 September 2008, 11 September 2008, 13 January 2009, 10 March 2009, 5 April 2009 and 5 May 2009) but at the meeting on 11 August 2009 it was agreed between the local authority and the Official Solicitor that quarterly meetings would suffice in future. The most recent meeting took place on 13 November 2009.</p>

In the circumstances, and as I made clear in my earlier judgment it must depend upon the circumstances, I entirely agreed that an oral hearing was unnecessary. The review has accordingly been conducted on paper, with the assistance of written submissions from Mr O&#8217;Brien on behalf of the Official Solicitor dated 4 December 2009 and from Ms Waldman of the local authority dated 7 December 2009. I am grateful for their assistance.</p>

They also agree that the placement at MH continues to meet BJ&#8217;s best interests. Dr C says that BJ has made &#8220;remarkable progress&#8221; there. Importantly, and Mr O&#8217;Brien on behalf of the Official Solicitor understandably stresses the points, Dr H notes that the restraints on BJ&#8217;s liberty are &#8220;minimal&#8221; and &#8220;wholly directed to enhancing his opportunities and skills&#8221; and concludes that the arrangements for BJ at MH which I have previously approved &#8220;remain appropriate, proportionate and constitute a minimum restriction upon BJ&#8217;s liberty <span style="font-style:italic">and allow access to opportunities which he would otherwise not have</span>&#8221; (emphasis added). Dr H further notes that there have been no episodes of physical restraint or of emergency medication this year and that BJ&#8217;s challenging behaviour has very much improved. He confirms that the Care Plan has been appropriately updated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr O&#8217;Brien submits that, even though these provisions do not actually apply to BJ, it may nonetheless be helpful to consider the regime under Schedule A1 to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> which would have applied if BJ had been accommodated in a place falling within Schedule A1, paragraph 1(2). As he points out, the procedure of review under Schedule A1 is what Parliament has determined to be sufficient, and presumably Article 5(4) compliant, to protect the rights of individuals such as BJ deprived of their liberty under those provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>. So even where, because of the nature of the accommodation, the safeguarding regime laid down by Schedule A1 does not apply, it nevertheless provides, he says, importance guidance as to the nature, intensity and frequency of review. I agree. I need not rehearse the provisions of Schedule A1, save to record that Mr O&#8217;Brien helpfully draws attention in this context to paragraph 42(2), which importantly requires reconsideration at the latest after one year, paragraph 102, paragraphs 103-107 and paragraph 108.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr O&#8217;Brien also helpfully draws attention to certain practical considerations. First, as he tells me, the Official Solicitor is concerned about the burden on the court should a large number of cases result in long term reviews by way of oral hearings listed before judges of the Family Division, whether sitting in the High Court or in the Court of Protection. There is, as he points out, and as is notorious, very considerable pressure on the lists in the Family Division, and requiring <span style="font-style:italic">oral</span> hearings by way of review in all cases of this kind would, he suggests, disproportionately intensify that pressure. The Official Solicitor therefore proposes that where the facts of the case indicate that it is appropriate, then a court review may be on the papers, but with the safeguard that the parties would be entitled to request and the judge to require an oral hearing where appropriate. That accords with what I said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re GJ, NJ and BJ (Incapacitated Adults) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2008/1097" uk:canonical="[2008] EWHC 1097 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWHC 1097 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 2 FLR 1295" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 2 FLR 1295</ref>, at para [40]. Mr O&#8217;Brien adds that the Official Solicitor has no objection to a direction that the review be undertaken by a local nominated judge of the Court of Protection, including a nominated circuit judge or nominated district judge, whilst supporting the approach which provides for the maximum judicial continuity. Again, that is an approach with which I entirely agree.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other matter relates to the public funding of BJ and others in like situation. As is well known, the solicitors whom the Official Solicitor retains on behalf of BJ are publicly funded by the Legal Services Commission (LSC) in a good number of such cases. I am told that, following discussion with those solicitors, the LSC has accepted that prior to each review a yearly public funding certificate may be sought to enable the protected party&#8217;s solicitors to act on the Official Solicitor&#8217;s instructions, covering the work related to annual deprivation of liberty reviews, including attendance at reviews and making representations to the court. Accordingly, the Official Solicitor remains as BJ&#8217;s litigation friend and thus ensures that BJ&#8217;s participation complies with Article 5. I understand that the position as to funding clients generally where repeated reviews are necessary is under consideration by the LSC.</p>

If <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> had been in force at the time the proceedings were issued, the matter would have been within the jurisdiction of the Court of Protection. And there are, moreover, the practical considerations which I have already referred to in paragraph [24] above.</p>
