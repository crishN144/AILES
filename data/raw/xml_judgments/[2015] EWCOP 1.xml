He had lived there for around 50 years. He purchased the property for his parents and lived there with them and his sister until their deaths.  He had lived alone with his cat Fluffy since the death of his sister in 1998. He is described as being a very generous man ready to help others financially if he believed they needed it, as well as making donations to various charities.</p>

The circumstances of P&#8217;s removal are disputed but from reading the papers the following details emerge. P was wearing his dressing gown and was without trousers or pyjama bottoms. It is alleged that SW1 told P that he was to go with her to an hotel. When P declined it is alleged SW1 told him that she would call the police. P was persuaded to go with SW1 by his friend who was present. P was taken from his home and placed in CH a residential home for those living with dementia. P was &#8216;very reluctant&#8217; to leave his home and was very distressed.</p>

An urgent authorisation was not put in place until 27/6/13 and a standard authorisation not until 4/7/13 some two months after P&#8217;s removal from his home. It is by no means clear that P lacked capacity at the time. The authorisation included restrictions on P&#8217;s attendance at Church and contact with friends.

Indeed, the independent best interests assessor comments in his report dated 7/7/14 &#8216;the least restrictive options were never tested&#8217; and further &#8216;He (P) was never given the opportunity and support to remain in his own home this being the least restrictive option&#8217;.</p>

If that is correct I fail to understand why P&#8217;s removal from his home of 50 years was considered to be a reasonable and proportionate solution to the problem or why his removal and detention was thought to be in his best interests. Action against the perpetrator(s) would have been preferable to the removal of the victim. The problem could have been addressed by the less restrictive and simple option of appointing a deputy to manage his property and affairs. However ECC would say that other factors influenced their decision to remove P from his home.</p>

A defenceless 91 year old gentleman in the final years of his life was removed from his home of 50 years and detained in a locked dementia unit against his wishes. Had it not been for the alarm raised by his friend RF he may have been condemned to remain there for the remainder of his days.</p>

They appeared unprepared to countenance any view contrary to their own. They maintained their resolute opposition to P returning to his home until the last possible moment. In my judgment the conduct of ECC has been reprehensible. The very sad and disturbing consequences for P cannot be ignored.</p>
