	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">This case is about a young man I will call RN. He is 22 and lives in the North West of England. Due to the nature of certain conditions he has, he is said to lack capacity to make decisions about whether or not to receive the vaccine against the virus that causes COVID-19. His GP has reached the conclusion that RN ought to receive the vaccine because of the risk posed to him in the event that he catches the virus. This is rejected by his mother, TN. She believes that the risks posed to her son by the virus are limited, particularly since he has already been infected on one occasion, whereas the risks posed by the vaccine are unclear and maybe significant. There is an impasse. Consequently, the ICB (A CCG) brings this application to this Court in support of the GP. </span></p>

Importantly, I read a report and replies to answers posed by TN from Dr A, Consultant Cardiologist dated 2 and 7 September 2022 respectively. I read and heard evidence from Dr B, the GP- who has stepped in to deal with this case in the absence of Dr C, RN&#8217;s usual GP.</span></p>

The last condition is particularly concerning to TN because she fears that the vaccine is more likely to cause her son very serious harm because of his heart condition. The Partial Trisomy 13 is a chromosomal irregularity that has had a significant effect on RN&#8217;s cognitive development.</span></p>

His parents are separated, although he does have contact with his father. I make it plain at the outset that I did not hear from RN&#8217;s father, and he contributed nothing directly to the Court. It was mentioned in the Court papers that he was in favour RN receiving the vaccine. However, I made it clear to TN, who became agitated when she mentioned RN&#8217;s father and his views, that I could not be sure what his views were, and my decision would not be influenced by any speculation there may be on my part as to what they might be.</span></p>

In 2021 there were discussions with her as to whether some agreement could be reached on RN having the vaccine. This was not possible. Given TN&#8217;s concerns about RN&#8217;s heart condition and the effect that may have on the safety of the vaccine, Dr A was asked to give his opinion. In late September 2021, he confirmed that it was his opinion that it was in RN&#8217;s best interests to have the vaccine.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">This application was made to this Court in March 2022. The progress has been slow. That was partly because the matter was adjourned by the consent of the parties in order to await what happened in another case concerning whether previous infection was a factor that ought to be taken into account when deciding on best interests- mainly because of the effect such an infection has on natural immunity. The issue was not resolved by the time of this hearing, sadly due to the death of the person concerned. </span></p>

I have seen the mental capacity assessment of Dr C dated 19 April 2022. This was not challenged. It confirms that, due to his learning disability, RN is unable to make any decision about whether he should receive the vaccine. He also lacks the capacity to litigate the issue. The statutory presumption of capacity is rebutted, and the Court has the jurisdiction to make the decision on his behalf. That decision has to be made in RN&#8217;s best interests. Before I deal with the relevant law, I shall consider the factual arguments that have been put before me- pro and contra.</span></p>

That evidence is clear and simple. As a learning-disabled person, RN is at higher risk than other members of the general popular of an adverse outcome should he become infected with COVID-19. That advice is based on the JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) as contained in Chapter 14a of the Green Book, published by the UK Health Security Agency. Since RN suffers from a chronic neurological disease- namely &#8220;severe or profound and multiple learning disabilities&#8221; he is in an at-risk group.</span></p>

Dr B was clear that his role as a GP is to follow Government guidance on who needed the vaccine and how to factor that advice into the particular circumstances of each individual patient when giving them advice. That is why, given RN&#8217;s cardiac condition, the GP surgery sought the advice of Dr A. </span></p>

It is important that Dr A&#8217;s clinic was already involved with RN. He had attended in May 2021 before the issue of the vaccine was raised with Dr A. Tests were carried out on RN. In his first report, Dr A considers in some detail the extent to which RN is vulnerable or at risk because of the cardiac conditions from which he suffers namely: &#8220;Partial Trisomy 13; Cardiac Manifestation: Tetralogy of Fallot (repaired 2001). Currently sinus rhythm, preserved pulmonary valve function, preserved biventricular function&#8221;. </span></p>

Repairs to the tetralogy of Fallot are also, therefore, reasonably common. However, partial Trisomy 13 (also known as Patau&#8217;s syndrome) is less common (1:160000). Also, since many of those suffering from the condition die in their first year, and most before they become adults, the presentation of those with repaired tetralogy of Fallot and Partial Trisomy 13 is very low.</span></p>

Much of what was put to him was what is described as being &#8220;public domain&#8221; information, most of it dealing with statistics and hypotheses about the effects and efficacy of the vaccine. I will come back to this as a source of evidence later. Although Dr A largely reiterates the fact that he is a cardiologist and nothing else, he does engage sometimes with the information asserted in the questions. His two most important answers are these. First, his opinions are based on national guidance recommending vaccination for priority groups such as the one into which RN falls. Secondly, he has not seen any change in clinical practice around the vaccine stimulated by the public domain information to which he has been referred.</span></p>

No one was called to support these hypotheses. I was left with nothing that undermined the advice given by JCVI/Green Book. The evidence, as distilled through Dr B seems to be that whether any individual person infected with the virus benefits with immunity, by how much and for how long is so uncertain, that vaccination (with a booster) is still advised in all vulnerable groups.</span></p>

For reasons I will explain below, this is simply not the Court&#8217;s role. Of course, materials calling the vaccine into doubt, whether that be its safety, or its efficacy are matters any informed person would factor into his own decision-making process when consenting to the administration of the vaccine, or not. However, that is a decision that the Court deals with when applying s. 4 MCA, as I will do below.</span></p>

When it comes to the safety of the vaccine itself, I must be guided by JCVI and the regulators. When it comes to the safety of the vaccine for RN I must be guided by evidence, including that provided by clinicians concerned with RN&#8217;s interests. Although there is nothing to counter the evidence of Dr A- in his written report and answers- I am invited to determine that there is a risk that ought to be factored into the best interests decision making process. </span></p>

Taking all those matters into account, it is submitted that RN would probably not consent to receiving the vaccine.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">COVID-19 is still a dangerous and potentially fatal virus. At the time of the hearing 188,000 people had died of COVID-19, 384 within the previous 7 days. The experience of the past two years is that the effect of the virus and its spread is likely to increase in Winter. That means the increase in the risk to RN of infection, illness and death. That explains why the regulatory framework in which the vaccine rollout took place was speedier than would normally be the case. It was, and is, an emergency and the regulations reflect that.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Furthermore, the overall context of the pandemic, and the UK Government and the other Governments of the UK in their approach to tackling the virus has been to seek to protect the healthcare infrastructure from the impact on it of large numbers of very ill infected people requiring Hospital care at any one time. The vaccine strategy reduces the number of very ill people requiring that level of care. Consequently, there is a very clear argument that those who are vaccinated are not only reducing their own risk of serious illness, but also ensuring that those that are very ill (with COVID-19, or otherwise) will not be prevented from receiving a good level of care. This is the altruistic argument. This is a powerful factor that is likely to be a strong argument for the vaccine for people in a risk group such as RN.</span></p>

She is sceptical about the vaccine and very concerned that it will harm her child. I believe that a capacitous RN would listen to his mother. He would be affected by what she said. Whether her views would persuade him, I am less sure. However, the views of TN cannot be determinative whatever effect they may have on RN.</span></p>

I cannot escape the simple reality that the vaccine is likely to reduce RN&#8217;s risk of developing a serious infection and dying of it. In the absence of any evidence that he is placed more at risk from having the vaccine than not having it- and there is none- I consider it clearly in his best interests to receive it.</span></p>
