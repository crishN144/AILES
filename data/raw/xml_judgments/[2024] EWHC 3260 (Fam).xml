Given the position that this court is in now it is easy to have sympathy with her.  Having children taken away is awful.  She is right to point out that as a victim of human trafficking she was damaged and likely to need help.  She is right to point to the fact that she asked the local authority for help.  She is right to point out that P was taken from her shortly after birth and I do not doubt her when she says she was still haemorrhaging.  I must bear in mind however that the court that made these orders had to deal with her as she was then, and did so on contemporaneous evidence, and most importantly had to protect the children then.  The provision of assistance to Ms A then and whether that provided an alternative to adoption for the children was considered at that time.  I do bear in mind that Jackson LJ in his comments on refusing permission to appeal said Judge Woodward was right to raise the issue of Ms A litigation capacity but having carefully reviewed the matter in all aspects she was entitled to find that the presumption of capacity was not displaced.</span></p>

Mr im Thurn tells me that the appropriate first step would be an approach to social services, and this has not happened.  Ms A disputes that.  He and Ms Crowell both point me to section 51A of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 as setting out the statutory framework for contact after adoption.  Ms A would require leave to make an application.  The factors I need to consider for granting leave are set out in s. 51A (5).  My attention is drawn in particular to s. 51A (5) (a), namely, the risk there might be of the proposed application disrupting the child&#8217;s life to such an extent that he or she would be harmed by it (within the meaning of the 1989 Act).</span></p>

That they say will cause them harm.  I agree with that submission.  The risk outweighs any advantage which might otherwise arise from satisfying the natural curiosity of the children as to their biological heritage.</span></p>

I note that the applications have proceeded to a hearing, albeit only on submissions.   I do consider, however, that the two applications for leave to bring a contact application in circumstances where (1) Ms A is applying to set aside the adoption orders and (2) considers it appropriate to say to the children that adopters kill children, are so ill founded as to be totally without merit.  On drawing the order I will certify the dismissal of those two applications to that effect.</span></p>
