The application is brought by the London Borough of Barking &amp; Dagenham, which local authority seeks a final care order and the continuation of a declaration that the deprivation of liberty resulting from N&#8217;s current therapeutic residential placement is lawful for the purposes of Art 5 of the ECHR.  The mother opposes the applications and seeks the return of N to her care.  The application of the local authority is supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian. </p>

I have heard oral evidence from Ms Nicola Clark, the home manager at N&#8217;s placement, from Dr Kennedy, consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, from Ms Richards, allocated social worker, from the mother and from the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  I heard oral closing submissions from Ms Munroe on behalf of the local authority, from Mr Squire on behalf of the mother and Ms Wilson on behalf of N on the instruction of the Children&#8217;s Guardian. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Ahead of this hearing there was the prospect of the court being invited to make a declaration that N&#8217;s human rights have been breached by reason of an incident of physical restraint of N, which incident also involved paramedics and the police.  However, at the outset of the hearing, it was unclear against which public authority such relief was sought.  In the circumstances, I was satisfied that it would be disproportionate to delay this final hearing whilst those issues were clarified and that any application for a declaration should be considered in separate proceedings once any such claim had been properly formulated and pleaded against the relevant public authority.  In the circumstances, the only issues before the court are those concerning N&#8217;s best interests within the context of proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court.  That, of course, does not preclude this court commenting where appropriate on the incident of restraint in question within that welfare context on the basis of the unchallenged evidence before the court. </p>

In the circumstances, there has been no substantive dispute before the court in respect of historical matters.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The background to this matter can be stated relatively shortly.  Prior to 27 February 2019, on which date an interim care order was granted, N lived with his mother.  N has an older brother, E, who was born in November 1998.  In 2009 E and N were made the subject of child protection plans due to what was said to be the volatile relationship between the mother and E and the use of physical chastisement against E by the mother, which physical chastisement was witnessed by N.  E was considered to </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On the unchallenged evidence before the court it is plain that, historically, the mother struggled also to meet N&#8217;s needs.  From 2014 onwards it was clear that the mother was finding it increasingly difficult to manage N&#8217;s behaviour.  Concerns regarding N&#8217;s behaviour and the mother&#8217;s capacity to manage the same continued through 2016.  In June 2016 he had to change schools as his old school was no longer able to manage his behaviour.  From early 2017 he became physically aggressive to others and made verbal threats to kill himself.  N at times became extremely verbally abusive, on one occasion threatening to spray everyone with acid.  N also directed abuse to his mother, who continued to struggle to deal with his behaviour.  In early 2018 the mother informed a Core Group Meeting that N was controlling and consistently threatening.  N was noted to deliberately challenge the mother.  The mother was not able to put in place and enforce boundaries for N, resulting at times on her exhibiting aggressive behaviour towards him.  He frequently stayed up all night playing video games online.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within this context, during the pre-proceedings stage of this case the local authority commissioned reports from Dr Castle, an adult psychiatrist and Dr Parsons, an adult psychologist, in respect of the mother, from Dr Kennedy, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, in respect of N, and from Kay-Marie Taylor-Duke, independent social worker, in respect of the parenting by the mother of N. </p>

He considered that the mother labours under a cognitive disability and a generalised anxiety disorder and recurrent depression.  He considered that were the mother to comply with treatment designed to address these issues there would be a significant improvement in her conditions.  Dr Castle made clear that a detailed assessment of the mother was properly within the remit of a psychologist.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within this context, Dr Parsons, reported on the mother&#8217;s psychological presentation on 18 June 2018. I pause to note at this point that Dr Parsons considered that the mother had capacity to conduct proceedings but that she would need assistance when in court to understand the proceedings.  Within this context Dr Parson made a number of recommendations in the body of his report and this court has the benefit of a report from Communicourt recommending that the mother have the services of an intermediary during this hearing, which she has done.  Accordingly, all parties and the court were aware of the proper approach in this case to ensure that the mother understood the proceedings as they unfolded at this hearing.  Regular breaks were taken as requested by the mother.  At all times the court has sought to give effect to FPR 2010 r 1.1(2)(c) (the requirement to ensure that all parties are on an equal footing) and, as I have noted above, FPR 2010 Part 3A (Vulnerable Persons: Participation in Proceedings and Giving Evidence).   </p>

He concurred with Dr Castle that the mother presented with depressive symptoms.  Dr Parsons recommended solution focused therapy and considered that effective change could be seen within two years if the mother engaged effectively with treatment.  Dr Parsons further identified that the mother demonstrates features of a Schizoid Personality Disorder, avoids social interactions and is, in consequence, socially isolated.  Dr Parsons did not concur with Dr Castles view that it is possible that the mother suffers from ADHD.   </p>

Such an assessment needs to be undertaken by an individual who is skilled in working with people with mild learning disabilities and should use a structured assessment framework, such as the PAMS assessment framework.  I note that an independent social worker assessment is in fact underway but, in my view, it is important that the recommendations I have made above, both in terms of the PAMS assessment and the methods of working with [the mother] are followed.&#8221; </p>

The assessment confirms that Ms Taylor-Duke undertook the PAMS &#8216;Parent Questionnaire&#8217; with the mother and applied the other recommendations made by Dr Parsons.  Ms Taylor-Duke confirmed that the mother&#8217;s parenting difficulties are related to her cognitive deficits.  Ms Taylor-Duke considered that the mother is able to meet N&#8217;s basic care needs but her ability to meet N&#8217;s emotional and development needs is affected by her learning difficulties, depression and high levels of anxiety. She considered that the mother required support for her own mental health needs in order to enable to support and parent N consistently well.  Ms Taylor-Duke recommended that residential placement be identified for N.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In November 2018 N met with Dr Kennedy. As Dr Kennedy articulated during the course of his brief oral evidence, N is a child with very complex needs.  Dr Kennedy first reported in this case on 19 November 2018.  He identified that, in his opinion, N is suffering from a longstanding reactive attachment disorder consequent on inconsistent parenting over a number of years from his mother.  Dr Kennedy further considered that N is suffering from oppositional defiance disorder, which is again linked to the quality of the parenting he has received from his mother.  Dr Kennedy further identified that N demonstrates severe ADHD.  Dr Kennedy considered that the result of these conditions is that N has difficulty in regulating his emotions, difficulty in sustaining trusting relationships and displays contradictory social responses.  As Dr Kennedy noted in oral evidence, N has also suffered two significant bereavements and has been removed from the care of his mother.  He has also been diagnosed as suffering from epilepsy.  Within this context, Dr Kennedy considered that N requires </p>

Dr Kennedy recommended that N be provided with a safe, containing environment and that a foster placement would not meet his needs.  It should be noted that in oral evidence, Dr Kennedy considered that <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> parent, no matter how competent, would struggle effectively to parent N given the extent and complexity of his needs. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The local authority issued care proceedings on 31 January 2019. Within the context of the recommendations made by Ms Taylor-Duke and Dr Kennedy, a specialist therapeutic residential placement was identified at a facility called LCR.  N was placed at LCR following the hearing on 27 February 2019.  Whilst the placement is independent of the local authority, the local authority provided additional in house staff to assist with management at this placement.  With respect to the progress of the placement I heard oral evidence from Ms Clark, the home manager at LCR and who has regular contact with N in this context.  She has filed a statement with the court dated 29 April 2019. </p>

N&#8217;s behaviour, which included the use of weapons, threats or attempts to injure staff, verbal abuse including racial abuse towards staff and self-harm through headbanging and biting, required the use of physical intervention by LCR in the form of holds on 1, 4, 6, 12, 14 and 28 April 2019.  One incident of physical intervention, albeit taking place outside the placement, has in particular caused the professionals in this case very real concern. </p>

As a result, his behaviour meant that he had be the subject of holds within the placement on the morning of 8 March 2019. Four holds were applied, of 5 minutes duration, 4 minutes duration, 7 minutes duration and 20 minutes duration (the maximum permitted).  A decision was taken to proceed with the school visit.  However, once at the school site N&#8217;s behaviour escalated considerably and further holds were applied.  Whilst in a hold N suffered a tonic clonic seizure and paramedics were called.  The paramedics arrived at a time when N was is a an extremely heightened state of emotion and shouting, swearing and making negative personal comments towards staff.  N repeatedly tried to damage property and kicked and punched the staff who tried to prevent him from leaving the area, he having kicked open locked doors, and spat in the faces of staff. As a result the paramedics called for support from the police and from additional paramedics.   </p>

In the circumstances, whilst N was placed in a hold the Police also applied handcuffs and leg restraints to N (the police contending that this was necessary to prevent injury to themselves and staff in circumstances where N was physically lashing and kicking out) and carried him to an ambulance, in which he also had to be held at times on the way to hospital.  From the content of the statements they have provided or these proceedings, the police offices plainly found the incident a trying and frustrating one </p>

Within this context, one of the officers concedes that on one occasion he swore when addressing N about the need for him to calm down. Once at hospital N agreed to walk into the building and the leg restraints were removed but the handcuffs remained on. At hospital N calmed to the point where the remaining restraints were removed and he returned to the placement. </p>

The latter caused N particular distress in circumstances where, for reasons yet to be determined, he has an acute aversion to people touching his legs in any way. Whilst for the reasons I have set out above I make clear that I make no findings of fact in relation to this incident, it will nonetheless be plain that this incidents is a matter of significant concern.  I will address this further below. </p>

He began to demonstrate an ability to reflect on his behaviour.  Less interventions in the form of holds or restraint were required.  He engaged with staff more effectively and managed face to face contacts with his mother.  In circumstances where there were signs that, notwithstanding the difficulties in managing N, he was, in relative terms, making progress and becoming more settled, at a hearing on 17 April 2019 it was agreed between the local authority and LCR that N could remain in the placement until 14 June 2019, subject to the local authority continuing to provide additional staff.  The strong impression I was left with is that this reassuring turn of events was down to Ms Clark, the home manager, and Ms Richards, the allocated social worker (who Ms Clark confirmed attended the placement on a regular basis), standing by N, continuing to work with him and advocating on his behalf when other considerations were, perhaps understandably prior to that point, becoming persuasive for more senior managers at LCR. </p>

The local authority and the placement will continue to work together to ensure the next stage of therapeutic input is made available to N to assist him in making further progress within the context of his particular needs.  Ms Clark was clear, when asked by Mr Squire whether N expresses a wish to return home to the care of his mother, that whilst he did so at times at the outset of the placement, and sometimes expresses a wish to return home to collect certain electronic items, he now speaks in a manner that suggests he contemplates his future at LCR. </p>

As I have noted above, whilst N did at times at the outset of the placement express the wish to return to the care of his mother, and sometimes expresses a wish to return home to collect electronic items, he now speaks in a manner that suggests he contemplates his future at LCR.  With respect to his physical, emotional and educational needs, by common acclaim these are accepted to be highly complex in nature.  The court has before it clear expert evidence of N&#8217;s particularly complex emotional needs, and clear evidence of the additional factors that complicate the same, including his ADHD and epilepsy.  In circumstances where N has been placed at LCR for a number of months, and in particular in circumstances where he is making progress (and has &#8216;turned a corner&#8217; to use Dr Kennedy&#8217;s formulation), the evidence before the court clearly demonstrates that the effect on N of changing his current circumstances would be a significantly adverse one.   </p>

These characteristics make managing his behaviour extremely challenging and will continue to do so, meaning that N will continue to find it difficult to regulate his emotions, trust others and sustain relationships.  Within this context, N is at risk of significant harm if his complex needs are not met by compensatory parenting in an environment that is safe, stable and secure.   In addition, N is a boy who is apt to say offensive and racially charged things that are likely to bring him to the attention of others.  Within this context, given the location of the family home, I am satisfied that his behaviour coupled with his vulnerability would expose him to a significant risk of exploitation by criminal gangs or other undesirable elements within his community. </p>

However, beyond this important observation, the mother is also an intrinsic element of N&#8217;s life and of his identity.  As N grows up, and as the Children&#8217;s Guardian made clear in her evidence, his relationship with his mother will continue to be very important to him.  Within this context, a placement with his mother would allow those advantages to pertain most directly for N.  Against this however, there are, I regret, manifest disadvantages to N returning to the care of his mother.  The evidence before the court is clear that the mother would not be able to meet N&#8217;s complex needs on a day to day basis.  As was pointed out by Dr Kennedy, this is demonstrated most starkly by the fact that contact between N and his mother has been reduced from 2 hours to 1 hour each session at the mother&#8217;s instigation.  Whilst Mr Squire is right to give credit to the mother for suggesting this reduction in N&#8217;s best interests, it demonstrates the gulf between the mother&#8217;s desire to care for N and her ability to do so.   </p>

The unchallenged evidence before the court demonstrates that the mother was increasingly unable to keep N safe even with support and that her own wellbeing suffered from her inability to control him.  Having regard to the expert evidence before the court, there is no evidence that the mother has sufficiently ameliorated these difficulties.  In addition, and as I have noted, whilst it is the case that there is no evidence before the court that N (or his sibling) have had contact with or involvement with gangs or other organised criminal groups, it would in my judgment be foolhardy to ignore this risk.  N is a vulnerable 11 year old boy who is apt to say offensive and racially charged things that are likely to bring him to the attention of others in the community in which his family home is located.  Satisfied as I am that his behaviour coupled with his vulnerability would expose him to a significant risk of exploitation by criminal gangs or other undesirable elements within his community,  I am equally satisfied that, sadly, his mother is not equipped at present to effectively protect him from this risk.   </p>

LCR, and in particular Ms Clark, is admirably equipped to meet those complex needs.  The undoubted and unchallenged progress made by N in this placement speaks to this.  Looking forward, Dr Kennedy is clear that the next and vital step in addressing N&#8217;s complex needs is the commencement of therapeutic input as an element of the compensatory parenting that N is now receiving.  This too can be provided at LCR.  The local authority is clear that N can remain at this therapeutic placement for as long as is necessary.  Within the foregoing context, and in particular having regard to the evidence of Ms Clark and Ms Richards, I am satisfied that by far the most efficacious option for meeting N&#8217;s current, complex welfare needs is the specialist therapeutic residential placement at LCR. </p>

Having regard to the features of that regime I am satisfied that, bearing in mind Cobb J&#8217;s view that the terms 'complete' or 'constant' define 'supervision' and 'control' as indicating something like 'total', 'unremitting', 'thorough', and/or 'unqualified' (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re RD (Deprivation or Restriction of Liberty)</span> at [31]), the regime of supervision to which N is subject can be characterised as &#8216;unremitting&#8217; and plainly falls within the concept of continuous supervision or control or, to put it in the terms of the <span style="font-style:italic">Storck </span>criteria, amounts to confinement to a certain limited place for a not negligible period of time. I am satisfied that comparing the situation in which N finds himself with the ordinary life of a 11 year old young person living at home with his family there are significant features that would not apply to a child of the same age, station, familial background and relative maturity who is free from disability.  Within this context, the living and </p>

With respect to that incident of restraint, as I made clear at the outset and I make clear again, I make no findings on the balance of probabilities in respect of the incident in circumstances where there may be further civil proceedings in respect of the same.  However, given the nature of the incident, as described above on the basis of the unchallenged evidence before the court, it is appropriate for the court to make the following observations. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">First, the situation that arose on 8 March 2019 must give cause for concern given the nature and extent of the restraint used, in particular the fact that there came a point when N, a slight and highly disturbed 11 year old child, was handcuffed and placed in leg-restraints by the police for an extended period, including during his transport to hospital.  Second, whilst making no findings, even a cursory reading of the records pertaining to the incident on 8 March 2019 suggests an unedifying picture of bickering over responsibility for managing N&#8217;s deteriorating behaviour on that date and as to the correct course of action.  This cannot have assisted when seeking to achieve a prompt and calm resolution of the situation for N.  Third, and finally, whilst the situation was clearly challenging for all involved, it is plain that it had an understandably adverse emotional impact on N, particularly in circumstances where he had an acute aversion to his legs being touched.  Having made those brief observations, and in circumstances where there may be further civil proceedings in respect of the events of 8 March 2019, I say no more. </p>

In the amended care plan the local authority proposes a baseline of monthly contact between the mother and N.  Whilst the mother does not seek to constrain the local authority&#8217;s management of contact in circumstances where contact will need to be led by N&#8217;s needs, she does point to the evidence of the Children&#8217;s Guardian that, whilst making clear that his needs may require a reduction in contact in the future (for example, as a result of the demands of therapeutic intervention), she could identify no welfare reason why the current level of contact of 1 hour every fortnight should not continue at present.  I likewise do not intend to constrain the local authority with respect to the management of contact by making an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/34" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 34</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>.  However, I am satisfied that if N wishes to have contact with his mother every fortnight for an hour I likewise cannot identify any welfare basis for objecting to this.  </p>

As Mr Squire points out, the tragedy of such a situation is often given an even harder edge by the fact that the parent in question is unable to perceive that they are not to blame for the situation in which they find themselves.  Such is the case here.  The mother loves N.  She gave her evidence with dignity and sincerity.  The sad conclusion of the court however, is that the mother is not at present, by reason of her inherent deficits and thus through no fault of her own, capable of meeting the complex welfare needs of her son. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">One other matter falls for comment. As I have noted during the course of this judgment, N has made significant progress in his current placement.  I am entirely satisfied that this is due largely to the dedicated, high calibre work of Ms Clark and Ms Richards, together with others who have supported them.  Notwithstanding the challenges presented by N, Ms Clark and Ms Richards have steadfastly refused to take his challenging behaviour as anything other than N seeking to try to communicate to them what he needs.  They have stuck by him when there were reasons to contemplate the ending of his placement and have worked extremely hard to help him make progress by engendering his trust through ensuring consistency, certainty and a sense for the N that the adults who are working with him will not be going anywhere.   </p>

Within this context, not only do I endorse in this case an outcome that ensures that N will continue to benefit from Ms Clark&#8217;s oversight at LCR but I also welcome in particular the indication of the local authority that Ms Richards will be remaining as N&#8217;s allocated social worker notwithstanding the making of a final care order.
