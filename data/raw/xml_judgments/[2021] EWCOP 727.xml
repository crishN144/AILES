On 15 February 2021 her mother applied to be appointed along with others as Lilia&#8217;s welfare and property and affairs deputy. At an initial hearing, Mr Justice Newton approved consent orders joining Lilia and appointing the Official Solicitor to represent her and for the NHS trust to file evidence.  </p>

I simply note that as a fact; I express no views on who is responsible for the parental conflict; that is not the purpose of these proceedings, is not justiciable within them and would probably serve no purpose. Almost inevitably Lilia&#8217;s mother and father must have been asking themselves could they have done anything differently which might have altered Lilia&#8217;s trajectory in life which has led here. I doubt that they will find any answer to those questions and it is highly likely that the causes of Lilia&#8217;s  psychiatric and psychological conditions and her attempt to end her life are complex and multi-faceted; it seems that Lilia&#8217;s psychological and psychiatric well-being was also significantly affected by the pandemic generated lock-down. Only the parents can have some sense of whether they might have done things differently and given Lilia a childhood less complex and troubled than that which she lived. They certainly owe it to their other daughter to try.     </p>

On 9 March 2021 I made a final declaration that Lilia lacked the capacity to conduct these proceedings and to make decisions as to her care and treatment. The evidence before the court then from Dr A  Lilia&#8217;s neuro critical care consultant, Dr B, her consultant neurologist and an external second opinion from Dr Andrew Hanrahan Consultant in Neurorehabilitation and Clinical End of Life Care Lead at the Royal Hospital for Neurodisability, all agreed that Lilia had sustained extensive hypoxic brain damage as a result of the attempted suicide and was either in a persistent vegetative state or the lower level of a minimally conscious state.

In the last few years Lilia was a university student. Since starting her course, she lived either in her university accommodation or with her mother and sister, residing with them for a continuous period from March to 30 December 2020. Lilia had been troubled for some time and had been under the care of Dr S, Consultant Psychiatrist, from December 2019. On 27 and 28 December 2020, Lilia took a staggered overdose of paracetamol for which she was in A &amp; E on 29 December. On 30 December 2020, she was admitted on a voluntary basis to a private psychiatric hospital for treatment for her depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). She had also been diagnosed with Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (EUPD) and had a history of self-harming behaviours. On 18 January 2021, whilst still an inpatient at the private psychiatric hospital and between observations Lilia tried to end her life. She was discovered and CPR was administered by the hospital staff. Lilia was taken by air ambulance to a London Hospital where she was admitted to the General ICU and, on 22 January 2021, to the Endoscopy ITU for ongoing Neuro Critical Care, where she has remained to date. The unanimous medical opinion is that Lilia has suffered a catastrophic global brain injury which has resulted in prolonged disorder of consciousness, from which she has not emerged and remains in a vegetative state. </p>

Section 15 gives the court the power to make Declarations as to whether a person lacks capacity to make a specified decision and the lawfulness or otherwise of any act done or to be done in relation to that person. Section 16 gives the court the power to make an order and make the decision on a person&#8217;s behalf.   Section 48 gives the court discretion to make an order on an interim basis and in particular if it is in the person&#8217;s best interests to make the order without delay. </p>

The fundamental principle of the sanctity of human life is enshrined in Article 2 of the Convention: everyone's right to life shall be protected by law. Further in the present context, Article 3 (protection from inhuman or degrading treatment) is relevant. In addition, it is an aim of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to secure the full enjoyment of human rights by disabled people and to ensure they have full equality under the law.  In cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Lambert-v-France</span> (20160 62 EHRR 2) the European Court of Human Rights has confirmed that the withdrawal of life sustaining treatment engages a State&#8217;s positive obligations under Article 2 but that permitting withdrawal and the circumstances under which it was permitted and how the balance was struck between the right to life and the protection of their right to respect for their private life and autonomy were within the margin of appreciation of states. The ECtHR retains a right to review whether in any particular case an individual&#8217;s Article 2 rights had been infringed or were within the margin of appreciation.  </p>

Where a patient is suffering from an incurable disability, the question is whether she would regard her future life as worthwhile. As was made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] Fam 33" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] Fam 33</ref>, it is not for others to say that a life which a patient would regard as worthwhile is not worth living. Likewise, dignity in life and death is a difficult subject which is not readily susceptible to objective definition. What one woman with her own subjective values and beliefs regards as undignified may not be regarded as so by another with a different set of values and beliefs. Thus, an intense focus on the patient concerned and understanding how they would likely view the situation is important rather than the imposition of some societal or cultural norm.  </p>

Respecting individual autonomy does not  always  require  P&#8217;s  wishes  to  be  afforded  predominant  weight. Sometimes it will be right to do so, sometimes it will not. The factors that fall to be considered in this intensely complex process are infinitely variable e.g. the nature of the contemplated treatment, how intrusive such treatment might be and crucially what the outcome of that treatment maybe for the individual patient. Into that complex matrix the appropriate weight to be given to P&#8217;s wishes will vary. What must be stressed is the obligation imposed by statute to inquire into these matters and for the decision maker fully to consider them. Finally, I would observe that an assessment of P&#8217;s wishes, views and attitudes are not to be confined within the narrow parameters of what P may have said. Strong feelings are often expressed non-verbally, sometimes in contradistinction to what is actually said. Evaluating the wider canvass may involve deriving an understanding of P&#8217;s views from what he may have done in the past in circumstances which may cast light on the strength of his views on the contemplated treatment. Mr Patel, counsel acting on behalf of M, has pointed to recent case law which he submits, and I agree, has emphasised the importance of giving proper weight to P&#8217;s wishes, feelings, beliefs and values see Wye Valley NHS Trust v B </span></p>

In the best interests meeting we asked him to explain his reasons for wanting Lilia to continue to receive treatment. He described one of his last contacts with her in the private psychiatric hospital, when her phone had been removed, and she was keen for it to be returned in order to watch Japanese animation and listen to music. He believes that if she achieved a level of awareness to hear music that she would appreciate that, and that it would be a fulfilment of her wish to have her music returned to her. He also recounts that she asked him to continue to provide her with private health insurance and not cancel it. (Of note, there is a recent episode described by mother, in which father reportedly &#8220;threatened&#8221; to withdraw support of VP&#8217;s private healthcare when he disagreed with the opinion of her psychiatrist). He believes that continuing to provide Lilia with ongoing healthcare would therefore be satisfying one of her final requests.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The medical evidence is essentially unambiguous in terms of the extent of Lilia&#8217;s brain injury. She has suffered catastrophic hypoxic brain damage which has left her in vegetative state. Thus, the diagnostic and functional criteria establishing her lack of capacity are agreed. The evidence demonstrates that the parts of the Lilia&#8217;s brain that made her who she was have been profoundly damaged most importantly in their connectivity or networking capacity which is central to who we are and the brain&#8217;s ability to interpret the senses, to process information and to generate responses. Whilst Lilia&#8217;s brainstem is still functioning even that has sustained some damage and whilst it may be capable of maintaining  the basic functioning of the body, including the drive to breathe (although that appears to be compromised to some extent according to Dr A A) that is continuing the life of Lilia&#8217;s body but not Lilia as an individual personality. Dr Hanrahan was clear that her current condition is consistent with her having no awareness of anything at all even the most basic sensations such as pain. Evidence about her moving her limbs or biting her tongue are not responses to external factors but are involuntary movements. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is also clear on the balance of probabilities that the prognosis is that she will remain in this state. The best prognosis &#8211; rated by Dr Danbury at less than 15% chance is for an increase to a minimally conscious state (MCS) minus. Dr Hanrahan both in his evidence and during the best interest discussion expressed a disinclination to discuss the prognosis in percentage chances. His evidence was clear that the prognosis for patients with brain damage arising from anoxia is generally at the lowest end of the spectrum for improvement because of the nature of the injury concerned and that the greater the period of time that passed without neurological change (he was reluctant to describe it as improvement) the greater the likelihood that the current condition would persist. His evidence, which the other clinicians and experts aligned themselves with was that on the balance of probabilities and as I understood his evidence a high balance of probabilities was that Lilia would remain in a vegetative state. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The evidence also emphasised that even were that prognosis to be confounded and that Lilia were to move along the spectrum from vegetative state to minimally conscious state to describe that as an improvement had the potential to be misunderstood. A neurological change could include some very limited reflex movement but that would not indicate that Lilia was developing awareness. Dr Hanrahan was clear in his oral evidence and indeed this is consistent with the overall effect of the other expert evidence that were Lilia to demonstrate neurological change that moved along the spectrum from vegetative state to MCS minus this would not mean that she had regained some sort of awareness which might lead her to an appreciation of her condition. What this sort of neurological change might involve was Lilia&#8217;s brain receiving some signals from her body at a very basic level. The evidence was that a neurological change was most likely to involve the brain sensing something internal to the body; a very primal or basic functions such as awareness of the bladder or bowel being full or pain from a pressure point. Dr Hanrahan also explained that were a neurological change of this sort to occur the (as he described it) bandwidth available would be narrow and would be taken up by such internal and basic interpretation of sensations. He was clear that this should not be confused with any higher functioning of the connected brain. He gave the example of Lilia&#8217;s ear being able to hear and perhaps there being some auditory reflex but this should not be confused with listening which required an association provided by the connected brain to the information that the ear might be seeking to provide and that this was highly unlikely. He accepted that one could not know for certain what Lilia could experience because no one in a prolonged disorder of consciousness could ever describe it. As he said if you could remember anything you could not have been in a prolonged disorder of consciousness; the two were mutually incompatible. However, he was clear that in terms of probabilities or in applying both theoretical and clinical understanding of the way the brain worked and the damage which it had sustained it was completely inconsistent with any experience or awareness of anything other than the most basic internal physical sensations. He explained that some individuals might appear to respond to familiar voices or music but this would not be because they had any conscious awareness but rather because sound could leave an imprint in the network of the brain but such a response was sub- cortical which I understood to mean a physical response like an auditory response to noise rather than indicative of awareness or appreciation of the connected brain. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Thus, the totality of the evidence points to the conclusion on the balance of probabilities that Lilia will remain in a vegetative state and that this could be for a period of many years. There is a remote possibility of neurological change that would place her in the minimally conscious state minus, but this would involve neurological change that would not result in Lilia&#8217;s becoming aware of anything other than the most basic physiological sensations. There may even be an unquantifiable possibility of her demonstrating neurological change that would move her along the spectrum into the MCS plus; they cannot be completely ruled out because nothing is impossible. However even this seems to me to be largely theoretical and illusory possibility would still not bring her into the category described by Dr Hanrahan of neurological consciousness functional consciousness. </p>

I can understand why he would wish to believe this possible. It must be almost impossibly difficult to contemplate the annihilation of the person that Lilia was and thus one clings to a hope that because one cannot know for certain that this allows for the possibility of Lilia continuing to have the capacity to exist in some familiar domain. I was left unsure at the conclusion of his evidence whether the father simply did not understand the effect of the evidence of the treating clinicians, Dr Hanrahan and Dr Danbury or whether it amounted to a conscious refusal or subconscious inability to accept the overwhelming weight of the evidence because it was inconsistent with what he wished to believe. Regrettably though, his position is not supported by the medical evidence and his insistence on maintaining the possibility of Lilia regaining some awareness of any sort which would be recognisable to who she was before, is to deny the reality that confronts his daughter. To make decisions on the basis of his own wish as to what he wants her position to be rather than on the basis of what her position actually is, inevitably is likely to lead to flawed decision making. </p>

A tracheostomy, a PEG to enable her to be fed, she will likely require anti-biotics to deal with chest or urinary tract infections. Dr A said that she is currently experiencing a raised temperature and her bloods suggest an infection. She will need washing and moving. Although she may not be aware of these treatments and may not suffer discomfort whilst in a vegetative state this does not mean they are not being done to her and certainly in respect of some aspects are causing physical injury and harm to her.  How would she feel about this? How would she feel about the possibility of her life encompassing some basic sensations including pain or discomfort or better but even then with medication which would assist with those negative sensations also probably eliminating any possible positive aspects. </p>

Although she identified that Lilia sometimes requires assistance from her ventilator to support her breathing she thought on balance that Lilia would maintain spontaneous breathing if taken off the ventilator and would not die suddenly but rather her body would slowly pass into renal failure and eventual death as a consequence of her not receiving nutrition or hydration. This might take 3-4 weeks during which she would be in receipt of opiate or benzodiazepine medication to relieve the discomfort or pain. How would she likely feel about this?  </p>

Save for the father&#8217;s interpretation of her views on the absolute sanctity and value of life, the sources of light all point to Lilia&#8217;s likely wish being not to be given treatment to prolong her life for she would see it as a life without quality or purpose and a burden to her and to those she loves. Those sources show that she loved experiences and sensations; the beauty of the natural world, culture and music, caring for others. They also show that she preferred to care for others than be cared for by others. She appears as a young woman of spirit and independence.  </p>

However, his extrapolation from them that Lilia would under no circumstances have wished for her life to be taken (as the father would put it) or for treatment not be given and to be withdrawn leading to her death is not in my view a reliable one. Her respect for the life of other human beings and her respect for the life of even the simplest of living creatures seems to me to be an aspect of her caring and </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">selfless nature which generated her willingness or need to care for her younger sister and which perhaps played a part in her desire to combine her caring nature with her interest in science in order to become a paediatric audiologist. That caring and selfless nature to others and her respect for the lives of non-sentient creatures does not necessarily translate into an absolute respect for life and in particular her life. It is entirely consistent with what one knows of Lilia that she would not support or herself take the life of another creature; that seems to me to be a facet of her respect for others and her unwillingness to impose herself or her decisions on them. However, the evidence points to Lilia as being an independent young woman whose autonomy was important to her. Absent some belief system which she adhered to in which sanctity of life was an absolute which allowed no human intervention to bring to an end I am unable to identify anything in the evidence of her friends and family, save her father, which leads to the conclusion that Lilia viewed her own life as sacred and outside her own power to end. The evidence suggests that Lilia had become an atheist although perhaps not openly to her mother and father who are I believe both Christians.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It also emerges from the evidence of Lilia&#8217;s communications with her father and the evidence of her sister that Lilia did not feel that the father understood her but sought to reframe her expressed views to fit with what he wished to believe.  Her decision to prevent him having access to information about her medical treatment also suggests she wished to distance herself from him, did not wish to share her most personal situation at this time and that is consistent with the other evidence of how she had reduced her contact with him in recent months. The evidence of a more positive telephone call in early January does not come close to demonstrating a change in Lilia&#8217;s then attitudes to her father. Thus, in evaluating the fathers evidence of his understanding of Lilia&#8217;s likely wishes and her views or beliefs which bear upon the decision seems to me one has to bear in mind that Lilia thought that the father did not understand her or wilfully misunderstood her. I also bear in mind his apparent inability to understand or accept the import of the medical evidence.  </p>

Thus, I do not consider that the fathers evidence that Lilia would have wished to remain alive as a matter of principle is established. Although he may be right that the question now is whether Lilia would wish to live the life now available to her rather than be dead, rather than whether she would wish to live the life previously available to her rather than that which is now available to her, once one has reached the conclusion that Lilia did not regard life as sacrosanct one then moves into a consideration of what her likely wishes would be in respect of continuing this life or discontinuing treatment and passing from this world. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The mother placed significant reliance on Lilia&#8217;s conversations with her friend about not wanting to live in a coma. She also placed considerable reliance on Lilia&#8217;s own decision to end her life. Lilia is recorded as having said to her therapist that causing brain damage and being in a coma was bad. The father cautions against placing too much reliance on either the suicide note or Lilia&#8217;s actions, on a passing conversation with a friend or limited comments to the therapist. It seems to me that what Lilia said to her friend and her observations to her therapist are far from determinative on the important issue of what her wishes would be in the current situation. A passing conversation arising out of a shared experience of a television programme is of some weight as well in that there was no suggestion from Lilia that she viewed life as sacrosanct, but this was not a prolonged or in-depth conversation arising out of some real-life event which required her to consider one of life&#8217;s profound existential questions. Equally her suicide note was written and acted upon at a time where plainly the balance had moved unequivocally into the negative for Lilia but I do not think one can automatically extrapolate from that that she would not wish to continue with lifesustaining treatment now. Nor her saying to the therapist that being in a coma with brain damage was bad. However, when one adds those to everything else that I know about Lilia it is my conclusion that a clear likely wish can be discerned. Lilia&#8217;s quality of life seems to have focused in significant measure on experiences and sensations. I do not get a sense that Lilia regarded the interchanges of her human relationships as the most important aspect of her life; perhaps her relationships with her mother and father and even her sister had been complicated. She clearly valued them and her friendships and her estrangement from her father may not have been long-term. I do not have sufficient information available to me to draw any firm conclusions but the impression from what she has said about her childhood experiences was that it was marred by conflict between those who should have been the most important figures in her life; her mother and father. It seems likely that her enjoyment of experiences and sensations may have been some escape from the complex thoughts which troubled her. Her inability now to enjoy any of the experiences and sensations which were a significant component of the positive side of her balance sheet would I am sure weigh heavily with her. Being trapped inside her body and unable to access the experiences which seem likely to have been an escape or release for her would be viewed by Lilia as intolerable. As an independent young woman, I am also sure that she would find the inability to take decisions or to act upon them a significant negative. Her concern for others, most poignantly expressed in her suicide note would I am sure have guided her wishes and it seems inconsistent with her nature for her to adopt a decision which would of necessity mean that mother, her sister, her father her grandparents and friends would continue to live their lives knowing of her attenuated existence and perhaps making her the centre of their patterns of life with all of the limitations that would place upon their ability to live their own lives rather than lives which revolved around her. If she was, as she seems to have been, a person who put others before herself I have little doubt that in the balance that she might have undertaken she would have concluded that it was far more important that </p>
