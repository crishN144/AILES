Accordingly, Professor Taylor, an emeritus&#160;professor of paediatric ophthalmology, was instructed.  He reported and gave evidence that the absence of retinal haemorrhages was not inconsistent with a conclusion that these head injuries resulted from inflicted trauma.  He advised that the research demonstrated that retinal haemorrhages were not reported in 15&#160;to&#160;25&#160;per cent of known causes of non-accidental inflicted head injury.

Dr Wild favoured the explanation that it was and that it resulted from a sudden rise in central venous pressure.  Professor&#160;Taylor disagreed because the spot was singular and unilateral and if the spot had resulted from a sudden rise in central venous pressure then he would have expected bilateral and multiple haemorrhages.  Moreover, Professor&#160;Taylor observed that the parties&#8217; account of the spot resolving into a linear line was not compatible with the expected evolution of subconjunctival haemorrhages.  Further, he noted that the spot had not been observed or investigated by any treating clinician.  Accordingly, he could not explain or ascribe a probable cause to this feature.  I agree with Professor Taylor and I prefer his evidence to that of Dr Wild given the former&#8217;s considerable expertise in the field of paediatric ophthalmology.  Accordingly, I make no findings in relation to the cause of the same.  </span></p>

He said he is not a violent person by nature but believes that M could be quite violent and could commit violent offences at night when he is asleep and it could be a form of sleepwalking behaviour, though he has no known history of sleepwalking.

However, in the context of an overview of these records, they have provided insight into how CD has demonstrated a high level of disturbed and disturbing behaviour throughout his childhood.  There is a history of childhood abuse by his parents, transient involvement of children&#8217;s social&#160;services, significant concerns about his behavioural problems at home and at school, difficulties with peers, learning difficulties and evidence of a comprehensive (including physical and neuropsychological) inpatient assessment by child and adolescent mental health services when he was 13&#160;years old.  The records also show that he presented a diagnostic conundrum in terms of his mental health since childhood and several diagnoses were considered, including autistic spectrum disorder, but apart from the evidence of borderline low intelligence and conduct disorder there was insufficient diagnostic evidence of others&#8230;&#8221; </span></p>

There are, however, suggestions that CD is also likely to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.  His reports about M may be symptomatic of dissociative disorder, as described in the attached appendix 1, but other mental disorders, including psychoses and the role of personality features and drugs, such as cannabis abuse, need exploring.  However, it is likely that a formulation of his mental health history will be more helpful than trying to pigeonhole CD&#8217;s difficulties into one or two neat diagnostic categories.&#8221;</span></p>

I couldn&#8217;t understand it because ever since her injuries were discovered he had always told me he hadn&#8217;t done anything, so I asked him what he meant and he said he didn&#8217;t mean it and he was lying about it but he wanted to see if I would believe him.  He said that if I believed him, he would be able to just say he had done it and other people would too and then maybe the judge would let me have H back.  I was cross with him and asked him if he had been lying.  He said he didn&#8217;t mean it and that he was lying when he said he had hurt her.  I know that CD can behave in ways that are a bit odd and I have caught him out lying before.  I didn&#8217;t believe him at the end of this conversation that he had hurt H and that is why, unlike when he spoke to me about M on 13 March, I didn&#8217;t tell anyone.  In fact I haven&#8217;t told anyone about it until I was giving instructions to make this statement.  I still don&#8217;t know what to think about what happened to H, but I am coming to think that CD may have hurt her in some way&#8230;&#8221; </span></p>

The haemorrhage may result from draining of the subdural haemorrhage into the spinal canal, but the muscle abnormality must result from an application of force.  If H&#8217;s upper spine had sufficient ability to flex during the abusive head-shaking episode on 20 March, that could have resulted in the muscle injuries.  Dr Wild was more ready to accept that those injuries were sustained in that episode.  In the premises, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities and find that all of the brain and spinal injuries were sustained in the shaking event described by the father.</span></p>

She wasn&#8217;t able to breathe or cry.  He squeezed for a couple of minutes.  She started to cry a lot.  She would be in discomfort and pain.  He put back the distressed baby.  [M] [that is the father] found her crying loudly.  She cried for 20 or 30&#160;minutes&#8230;  M did not want me to have a child.  It was his attempt to get rid of that child.&#8221;  </span></p>
