	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In October 2023 I handed down a findings of fact judgment in this case. On 1 May 2024 I handed down a final judgment making a care order for the four children with whom I am concerned, approving care plans that placed each in long term foster care with provisions for family time. I received submissions on the publication of the judgments. The current proceedings began after the eldest sister of the children was murdered by a member of the wider family. He has been convicted of her murder and is serving a life sentence of imprisonment. The murder trial was reported and so his name and the name of his victim are in the public domain. Nevertheless, the children, who range in age from 2 to 15 have a right to respect for their private and family lives and would suffer harm if details of their private and family lives were published and/or became widely known. I have weighed those rights and interests against the Article 10 right of freedom of expression. The judgments focus on the particular circumstances of the children and their family, but they concern allegations of honour based abuse that may have wider significance, in particular since there are not many published judgments from the Family Court dealing with allegations of a similar kind. There is a strong public interest in publication so that the public have access to how such issues are determined. On the other hand, notwithstanding the publicity there has already been about the murder, I should take steps to try to protect the children&#8217;s identities from being publicised. I have therefore decided to publish this single, heavily redacted, and anonymised judgment covering my findings of fact and final welfare determinations. It is a single judgment to aid understanding, but it is in two parts: Part One is the judgment that followed the findings of fact hearing in 2023 and Part Two is the judgment that followed the final welfare hearing in 2024.</p>

I shall refer to their children in age order as A, now deceased, B, C, D, E, and F. The intervenor, G, is a member of the children&#8217;s wider family. The man convicted of A&#8217;s murder is referred to as H and his daughter as J.  H is also a member of the wider family. Other members of the wider family are women: K, L, and M. Another male member of the wider family is T. The area where the family live is not to be published or communicated and so I shall refer only to &#8220;N&#8221; as connoting the relevant town or city. The Local Authority cannot therefore be named and I shall refer only to &#8220;the Local Authority&#8221;. The key social worker is Ms S. Details of A&#8217;s life and murder and some specific dates would be likely to lead to the identification of the children and so I have redacted them. Accordingly, some of the evidence on which I relied cannot be included in this published judgment. I have omitted reference to many familial relationships and I have obscured some of the chronology in order to avoid &#8220;jigsaw identification.&#8221;</p>

Furthermore, although the police arrested other family members including A&#8217;s parents during the investigation, no evidence of the involvement of the parents or any other family member was uncovered. However, the applicant Local Authority maintain that the evidence, including a number of troubling events preceding and subsequent to A&#8217;s death, establish the threshold for making public law orders in respect of the remaining children of the family. </p>

K, L, and G were effectively summarily evicted.

On turning 18, B chose to continue to live at the family home where she remains. A did not return home. She continued to live with G and K in the family property. It seems that she was happy in her new life but she had no contact with her parents.

Notwithstanding the injunction, evidence at the criminal trial revealed that H visited the house on a number of occasions on the date of the murder and managed to obtain a copy of the key to the house.</p>

Final welfare decisions had to be adjourned. The focus of the first hearing was therefore on factual allegations made by the Local Authority.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[37] It therefore follows that, in cases where there is potential conflict between Article 3 and Article 8 rights, the court must strive for an outcome which takes account of and achieves a reasonable accommodation between the competing rights. In this context, I have deliberately chosen the word "accommodation" to reflect the court's approach. The required judicial analysis is not a true 'balancing' exercise in consequence of the imperative duty that arises from the absolute nature of Article 3 rights. Where the evidence establishes a reasonable possibility that conduct sufficient to breach Article 3 may occur, the court must at least do what is necessary to protect any potential victim from such a risk. The need to do so cannot be reduced below that necessary minimum even where the factors relating to the qualified rights protected by Article 8 are particularly weighty. Hence the need to find a word other than 'balance' to describe this process of analysis.</p>

The facts of the present case, in which the judge's order imposes a permanent travel ban upon K leaving the UK, presents the conflict, between the need to protect the individual from serious harm against the individual's freedom to conduct their private life as they wish, in stark relief.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[39] Once again, all parties before the court were in agreement that an assessment of proportionality must be undertaken. On one view, "proportionality" may seem to be an inappropriate concept when the court is considering an absolute Convention right such as Article 3. However, in cases where there has not yet been a forced marriage, the court will not be dealing with the certainty that future harm will take place but, rather, the assessment of the risk that it may do so. Where protective measures will necessarily limit the freedom of the protected person and others to enjoy other Convention rights, it will be necessary to evaluate, with a degree of precision, the extent of protection that is necessary in each individual case. In this regard, the exercise to be conducted in a FMPO application is broadly similar to that undertaken where the risk of future harm arises from the potential for Female Genital Mutilation ("FGM"). In that context, this court (Irwin, Moylan and Asplin LJJ) considered the imposition of a "worldwide travel ban" in an FGM case in Re X (A Child: FGMPO) (Rev 2) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2018/1825" uk:canonical="[2018] EWCA Civ 1825" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWCA Civ 1825</ref>.</p>

This is an important stage and the court may be assisted by drawing up a balance sheet of the positives and negatives within the circumstances of the particular family in so far as they may relate to the potential for forced marriage.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[53] At Stage Four, if the facts are sufficient to establish a risk that the subject will experience conduct sufficient to satisfy ECHR, Article 3, the court must then undertake the exercise of achieving an accommodation between the necessity of protecting the subject of the application from the risk of harm under Article 3 and the need to respect their family and private life under Article 8 and, within that, respect for their autonomy. This is not a strict "balancing" exercise as there is a necessity for the court to establish the minimum measures necessary to meet the Article 3 risk that has been established under Stage Three.</p>

In each case, the court should be encouraged to establish a bespoke order which pitches the intrusion on private and family life at the point which is necessary in order to meet the duty under Article 3, but no more. The length of the order, the breadth of the order and the elements within the order should vary from case-to-case to reflect the particular factual context; this is not a jurisdiction that should ordinarily attract a template approach.</p>

Criticisms of the conduct of some members of the family made by professionals who later became involved with the supervised contact, fail fairly to reflect the fact that expectations were not clearly set out for the family at the outset. For example, B and G both bought watches for C. Professionals were understandably anxious that inducements should not be given to C. However, to B and G these gifts may well have seemed to have been innocent gestures. Furthermore, although professionals suggested that the watches might be &#8220;smart watches&#8221; capable of being used or private messaging to and from C, inspection of one of the watches showed it to be a fitness device that measures heart rate, not a smart watch. </p>

This has resulted in her being prevented from attending contact at some stages.

Ironically, she feels more restricted now, as a looked after child, than she did when living at home where, the Local Authority allege, she was excessively controlled by her parents.</p>

However, she went on to tell the jury that the Father had been humiliated when his plans for A to marry her first cousin had been thwarted. He was furious, as was his wife, the Mother, because they had broken their word which involved a significant loss of face in the Pathan communities both in Pakistan and in N. She also told the Crown Court that the Father was very strict with A, controlling what she wore, home-schooling her rather than allowing her to go to school, and that he intended to prevent her from going into further education. She gave evidence at the trial that A was &#8220;petrified&#8221; of her father and that a month before her murder, the Father had stopped C and B communicating with A.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">L gave evidence remotely. She had been the subject of a witness summons. According to her own evidence she had suffered abuse as a child and came close to being forced into marriage. She was willing to share her view that the Father, whose whereabouts are uncertain, was involved in the murder of his daughter, her niece. Accordingly, I have to be mindful of L&#8217;s vulnerability as a witness. As it is, she came across as confident and engaging when giving her evidence, but her evidence has been inconsistent over time. I am sure that she has allowed her instincts and feelings of animosity to certain other members of the extended family, to impede her objectivity. It is not easy to reconcile her belief that A was at risk of serious harm from the Father, indeed that he was involved in her murder, with her confidence that it was safe for the other children to return to their parents&#8217; care. She did not satisfactorily explain that apparent contradiction. I am satisfied that she has not told me of her true reasons for terminating her care of the children in late Year X. At the time the social work team understood that her departure to Pakistan was temporary only, but she told the Crown Court and me that it had been too much to care for A and her siblings as well as her own children, in short, that she was not intending to care for them again in the future. If she truly believes that the Father is capable of murdering his own daughter, why did she so suddenly change her intentions to care for the children in Year X? Why, at the same time, did she give such reassurance to the authorities that the children&#8217;s allegations, including A&#8217;s, had been made up or were groundless? Unfortunately, the changes in her evidence over time, and the inconsistencies between her evidence to the jury and to me, leave these and other questions about her evidence unanswered. However, I remind myself that if much of her evidence is true, she has exposed herself to a risk of harm by giving her evidence, and this may have caused her not to be fully open with the Court.</p>

He called the Father to tell him about the phone and to &#8220;prepare for the worst.&#8221;  This is of significance because after the phone had been found but before A&#8217;s body had been found, the Father said to the police after his arrest, &#8220;My daughter&#8217;s died &#8211; she&#8217;s been murdered by [a member of the family].&#8221; The question that arises is what grounds the Father had for saying not only that A was dead, and that she had been murdered, but also who had committed the murder. In his initial police interview in Year Y, and in his first statement in these proceedings, the Father said that he already knew that H had been arrested and he therefore believed that A was dead and that she had been murdered by H. In fact, a text from G to the Father timed before the Father&#8217;s statement read, &#8220;no body has been found&#8221;.</p>

Her central roles in life &#8211; as a wife and mother &#8211; have largely been ripped away from her: her eldest daughter murdered, her other children, apart from B removed from her care, her marriage broken down and perhaps permanently ended. Nevertheless, even making due allowances for her vulnerabilities, I found her to be very evasive in her evidence which was not credible in many important respects.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The Mother told me that prior to Year X family life had been happy. She shared with the court a number of photographs of the family to underline this. The children had been free to dress as they wished, to mix with whom they liked, and to make their own decisions about education. She told me that there had been no problems at home other than A stealing money. The sole reason why A concocted a series of lies against her parents and presented them to the police and social services was as revenge against her father who had confiscated mobile phones from her after she had stolen money from him to purchase them. She had done this three times even though, according to the Mother, A need only have asked for a mobile phone and her parents would have acquired one for her. Her explanation for A making false allegations was different from that given by the Father when the police intervened in Year X. At the time he said that A was motivated by a desire not to remain in the family home with her mother whilst he was away in Pakistan (as he had planned). The Mother told me that the only reason why B, C, D, and E had also lied to the police and social services in Year X was because A had told them to do so and they were &#8220;not old enough to understand&#8221;. In fact, at the time, B was nearly 16 years old, and C was 12.  The children&#8217;s accounts at the time do not have the hallmarks of having been orchestrated &#8211; they give different accounts of various incidents. The allegations were of a very serious nature and the children would all have been very soon aware of the dramatic consequences of making them. Why would A repeatedly steal money to purchase a mobile phone if she only had to ask and her parents would have obtained one for her? I do not find it credible that children within a happy family would voluntarily leave home, make serious allegations to the police and social services against their parents, refuse to return home or even see their parents for a number of weeks, simply because their eldest sister had told them to do so. I am satisfied that the Mother was not frank with the court about the nature of family life before the children made the allegations. She has concealed the truth and given a false account in that respect.</p>

She said that C was angry but that she had not physically chastised C and that A was lying about the incident. In her oral evidence to me, the Mother not only said that the alleged incident was a lie, made up by A, but also that C had not been fasting. This was contrary to her evidence to the police.</p>

If that was truly her attitude to A, it is inexplicable that they did not meet or speak even on one occasion during the period when A was living with G. They could easily have met somewhere other than the family property house if it was difficult to meet there due to K&#8217;s presence. There is no evidence that A refused to see her mother. The Mother and the Father made no effort to see or communicate with their eldest daughter. There were no communications at all between her parents and A during that period. Further, in her police interview the Mother&#8217;s solicitor read out a prepared statement on her behalf in which she said that A was &#8220;very abusive at times and unruly but we have always ignored this. I love my children and believe my eldest daughter has put the others up to this.&#8221; In his police interview on the same date, the Father said that on A threatening to leave the family home, he had told her that as she was 18 years old she could go but, if she left then &#8220;don&#8217;t come back&#8221;. A&#8217;s parents were feeling very hostile towards her. The Mother&#8217;s assertion to me that the door was always open to A conflicts with other evidence in the case.

When I asked her to be more specific, she said that she blamed L, J &#8220;because she put the allegations against us&#8221;, and her mother-in-law, K. Her reason for blaming K was because she had been told that she had asked H to kill A. She could not remember who had told her that nor what the Father&#8217;s view had been of that information, even though the information (and its source) would be highly relevant to a police investigation into the death of her daughter. The information would also be very relevant to her feelings that the Father&#8217;s family had ruined her life.  I remind myself that in late Year Y the Father and the Mother jointly applied to the court for the interim return of the children to their care. I refused that application but they had jointly proposed that they could look after the children together. The Mother told the court at the substantive hearing that a month after that hearing before me they had rowed about the role of the Father&#8217;s family in ruining the Mother&#8217;s life, and that her husband had pronounced talaq and left the home. She told me that she did not know where he was and had had no contact with him, but that B had told her that he was in Pakistan. She could not explain why, if he had the good relationship with his remaining children that she says he had, he would depart so suddenly and have no communications with them. She said that she &#8220;didn&#8217;t know&#8221; if he was concerned about what H would say about him at the forthcoming criminal trial. I am satisfied that the Mother has withheld the truth from the court about the circumstances of the Father leaving the family home and disappearing shortly before the Crown Court trial of H for the murder of his daughter.</p>

She consulted with Ms S and with her line manager and then produced a &#8220;Brief Report&#8221; concluding that G was not suitable as a foster carer for the children.

She recommends that the FMPO&#8217;s should remain in force. The Guardian said that if she had had the benefit of Ms Rattu&#8217;s expert evidence about honour based abuse at the time of the first set of public law proceedings in Year X-21 she would possibly have changed the recommendations that she then made. The fact is that the Local Authority and the Guardian invite the court to make findings now which are at odds with the approach taken in 2021 when the then subject children were returned to their parents&#8217; care. </p>

Much of her work has been as an advocate for those who have experienced abuse. She is Executive Director of Karma Nirvana, a national charity working in the field of HBA. She has advised public bodies and the Home Office and works with the All Party Parliamentary Group for HBA. She is a non-practising barrister. She was actively involved in the drafting and implementation of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/20" uk:canonical="2007 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007</ref> and the introduction of forced marriage within the criminal law through the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/12" uk:canonical="2014 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014</ref>. She has been active in campaigns to raise the legal age of marriage to 18 and to ban virginity testing. She is UK chair to the global Girls Not Brides coalition.

But her ability to separate her functions as a campaigner and an expert witness are entirely questionable.&#8221; I was shown a news report in which Ms Rattu was interviewed after the verdict in the trial of H. She told the reporter of her concerns that the FMPO had failed to protect A, thereby implying that there was a link between the FMPO and A&#8217;s murder. Ms Rattu had already been instructed as an expert, and had written her first report, in the present case when she gave that interview. When cross-examined about that comment and how it could be reconciled with absence of evidence at the trial of a link between the FMPO and A&#8217;s murder, Ms Rattu said that the police did not properly &#8220;understand the honour dynamic and if it is not picked up it doesn&#8217;t translate to the prosecution&#8221;. Counsel for the Mother say that the evidence from the police and the criminal trial shows that HBA was properly considered but that no evidence that the killing was associated with HBA was found. Mr Pratt KC and G further submit that Ms Rattu placed undue reliance on the defence statement of H which must have been rejected by the jury which convicted him. It is submitted that Ms Rattu had determined that A&#8217;s murder was linked to HBA and closed her mind to alternatives, notwithstanding the evidence from the criminal proceedings which suggested that there was no honour based motive to the killing. Further criticism is made of the section of her report on Pashtun culture which, it is said, &#8220;is not her work at all&#8221;. Ms Rattu did not use quotation marks around parts of that section, in particular paragraph 4.17, when, in fact, they were quotes from published articles.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The Pashtun culture from which this family derives adds contextual relevance. Ms Rattu&#8217;s experience of working in cases involving families from the Pashtun culture shows that women and girls within those families are often controlled by ensuring that family honour and respect are held intact. Pashtun culture is, she says, backed by the Pashtunwali, an unwritten code of honour that is necessary to have Pashtun identity. The essential components of Pashtunwali are honour, generous hospitality, sanctuary and revenge. Pashtunwali operates as a form of patriarchy: the status of a Pashtun family declines if the male members do not uphold their honour, including the honour of female relatives. Ms Rattu provides references to source material for her assertions about Pashtun culture but stated in court that she does not purport to be an expert on the culture. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In her interview with and assessment of the Mother, Ms Rattu noted that &#8220;it was difficult to obtain a direct answer to many of my prepared questions.&#8221; The Mother revealed extensive evidence of first cousin marriage within her family. The Father was her own first cousin and she always knew it was planned for her to marry him and she wanted to marry him. She did not go to school and had no other goals as a child other than to get married. After marrying she eventually left Pakistan and moved to N. Her family have never visited her here. The Mother described her mother-in-law as strict but could not give much information about the rift in the family which had directly involved her husband and mother-in-law. The Mother explained that she had asked her husband for a divorce and he had left. They have not since spoken and that her side of the family are not speaking to him. The Mother said she had &#8220;no idea&#8221; when asked about her thoughts on H&#8217;s suggestion that someone else in the family had killed A. The Mother was unable to engage with questions about honour and could not provide any examples of behaviour that could be perceived as shameful or dishonourable. She said that it would not be shameful at all for a girl to have sex before marriage and to undergo a termination of pregnancy. Ms Rattu&#8217;s conclusion was that it was &#8220;difficult to rely upon her answers as a reliable indicator of the risks posed and the family&#8217;s ability to mitigate those risks.&#8221;</p>

The divorce had caused [K] to &#8220;play hell&#8221;. J had been living at the family property but moved out secretly to L&#8217;s home without informing K. He explained that H did not know that J was divorced or how K, had organised the marriage. H had fallen out with K in 2007 because he felt she had ruined his life. G explained the rift that had happened when the Father had forced K out of the family property house. He said that another member of his family, T, had taken some family properties in Pakistan in mid-Year X and that the Father had been planning to go there with his father to stop that happening (the Father could not then go because of the children&#8217;s allegations leading to the Father&#8217;s arrest). G told Ms Rattu that he believed K, &#8220;pumped up&#8221; H to kill A &#8220;because she is the Father&#8217;s daughter&#8221; and she is a &#8220;very revengeful woman&#8221;. G said that honour was important to K, H, and T but he was not sure if it was for the Father. He described A as having been &#8220;disowned&#8221; by her father whereupon she became &#8220;my daughter&#8221; and that the Father felt &#8220;shame in what had happened.&#8221; G said that causing shame was a &#8220;big issue within the family&#8221; and that K, H and T held strong views about upholding honour, &#8220;100%&#8221;. G did not share common views within his family that the role of women was to cook, clean and stay at home &#8220;don&#8217;t get a job, don&#8217;t get an education.&#8221; Ms Rattu&#8217;s view was that G was open and honest in his responses which provided an insight into honour dynamics and risks within the family setting.</p>

She said that &#8220;we all lied&#8221; in Year X when allegations were made about potential forced marriage and abuse by her parents. She could not see any connection between A&#8217;s murder and those events. A had &#8220;told us&#8221; to make the allegations that were made in Year X &#8220;because she stole money from my dad to get a phone&#8221; and wanted &#8220;to take revenge on her dad for taking her phone.&#8221; A had told her that if they lied they could go to L&#8217;s house and have parties and fun. B said that there was no difference at all in how males and females were treated within the family. She described her parents&#8217; relationship as &#8220;very happy&#8221;. B said that her father had moved to his father&#8217;s house after the court hearing in December Year Y. He later told her that he was taking a flight to Pakistan and would not come back. He was upset because of the involvement of social services in the family&#8217;s lives. He said he would re-marry in Pakistan and start a &#8220;whole new life&#8221;. She did not think he would return. B said that honour was important within Pashtun culture but &#8220;not to the extent of murdering&#8221;.

When asked why, she said &#8220;ask A&#8221; even though, of course, A was dead. She denied that any of the examples Ms Rattu gave, such as having sexual relations or a termination of pregnancy outside marriage, would be shameful. Ms Rattu&#8217;s opinion was that B minimised the potential risks of HBA.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.13in">Ms Rattu&#8217;s conclusion was that there was &#8220;strong evidence within the bundle of potential honour based abuse dynamics and connected risks to the children which included Pashtun culture, suggestions that A was in a relationship and might be bi-sexual (there was some evidence suggesting she had written about this in her diary), extensive coercive control, physical abuse used as punishment, difference in treatment of boys and girls, the family history involving L, M, and J, collusion from extensive family members, disownment of A, and the defence statement of H. She considered that there was a risk of physical abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour if the children returned to live with their mother. She suggested that there were two hypotheses for how A was murdered, both of which were relevant to the potential risk to the children on return to the family: (i) K orchestrated the murder through H, and (ii) another family member killed A to save face. In her view returning the children to the care of family members would be unsafe and it would be difficult to mitigate against the risks to them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am quite satisfied that Ms Rattu&#8217;s evidence is of assistance to the court and that she has the necessary knowledge and experience to provide expert evidence. I am further satisfied that there is a reliable body of knowledge and experience to underpin her evidence, and that she has provided references and examples of her own experience to show that. She ought to have used quotation marks where quoting from a source, but the source is referenced at the bottom of the relevant page of her report. As to her impartiality, I note that her report was submitted prior to the jury&#8217;s verdict. I do not regard her references to H&#8217;s defence statement as evidence of her lack of impartiality. She was wrestling with the evidence provided to her and trying to make sense of the evidence prior to the jury&#8217;s verdict and given the lack of other explanations given by H himself. Ms Rattu was wearing her campaigning hat for the interview after the verdict, not her expert&#8217;s hat. Her expression of concern about the lack of monitoring of the FMPO was a legitimate concern and did not suggest to me that she had closed her mind to HBA not being relevant to the case before this court. Ms Rattu should be mindful that the roles of independent expert and campaigner do not always sit comfortably together and she would have been better advised not to make public comments about A and the trial of H when she had been instructed as an expert in this case and this case was ongoing. It was wholly appropriate for Counsel for the Mother, and others, to test Ms Rattu on the question of her experience, expertise and impartiality. It was fairly done. But I thought that Ms Rattu answered such questions with good grace and in a very considered manner. She gained my confidence that she <span style="font-style:italic">had </span>approached the material provided to her with objectivity. I am satisfied that she meets the four criteria for the admission of her evidence, as an expert, set out by the President in his Memorandum of 2021.</p>

She recommended that &#8220;the children are not reunited at present as a collective group, and they remain in their respective foster placements. She did not assess the Mother but did see her at a contact session with all the children. She did speak to the foster carers and the social worker.

She was adamant that there were no concerns around forced marriages at the time or at present.  She reported to feeling that the local authority is not understanding her family and have unnecessarily separated the sibling group.

The court faces a difficult task in trying to make determinations about the events that have surrounded this family over the past three years. Firstly, there has been inconsistency &#8211; the children made serious allegations in Year X and then retracted them. Secondly, although professionals and the court came to clear conclusions in 2021 about the risks to the children arising out of the history to that point, subsequent events require a re-consideration of that history. Thirdly, I am sure, members of the family, including the wider family, have not been prepared to tell the court all that they know. In those difficult circumstances I remind myself that I am not bound to adopt the findings of the Family Court in 2021, nor even to accept the conclusions of the Judge or jury in the Crown Court, but neither should I speculate. My findings must be based on the legal principles set out above, applying the burden and standard of proof to the evidence before me. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wider family has, one way or another, been involved a number of quite striking disputes and disagreements over a number of years. These have resulted in deep rifts within the family, including between the K and her former husband, between H and his daughter J, between K and the Father, between other members of the wider family, and, I am sure, between A and her parents. These divisions have involved money and property but there is also a history of division and deceit in relation to marriage. The degree of hostility involved in some of these rifts is marked. As an illustration of the strength of feeling sometimes involved with these rifts, G considers K capable of &#8220;pumping up&#8221; H to murder A in order to avenge the Father. H threatened his daughter with a knife. On the Mother&#8217;s evidence, upon divorce this year, her husband did not just leave the family home, he disappeared and, according to her daughter B, is going to start a new life in Pakistan. This is a family characterised by rifts and extreme behaviour.</p>

Her father had been deceitful about his plans and K and the Father had to act clandestinely in order to &#8220;rescue&#8221; her and take her out of Pakistan. I am also satisfied, on the balance of the evidence received, that her one other female sibling, M, defied her family when she chose to marry a man to whom she was not related, and has been effectively ostracised by most of the family members since that time. J&#8217;s history is a little different. I do not have the benefit of hearing from her in relation to her marriage to the taxi driver whom she met in Saudi Arabia. However, the evidence establishes that K played a significant role in facilitating that marriage which took place abroad when J was only just 18, using subterfuge and deceit to enable the marriage the take place against the wishes of other members of the family. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A forced marriage is not the same as an arranged marriage but if it is made clear to a girl or young woman within a family that she is expected to marry a first cousin or other man of her parents&#8217; choosing, if there is a high degree of control within that family, if arrangements are made without her knowledge, and if she is made to understand that it would be dishonourable for the marriage not to take place, then it might readily be concluded that the consent she may ostensibly give to the marriage, if any at all, is not true consent, and the marriage is one that is being forced upon her. That is what A reported to the police and social services she feared was going to happen to her and B and C in Year X. There is no dispute that her father had recently renewed all the children&#8217;s passports. There is no dispute that he was about to fly to Pakistan. The family home was being sold. Furniture including children&#8217;s beds had been sold. There was, I am satisfied, a history of family members using deceit when making arrangements for the marriage of young women within the family. L considered the children&#8217;s concerns about forced marriage to be credible and her contact with family members in Pakistan gave some support to the fear that marriages were intended for the girls (even if they turned out only to be rumours).</p>

In doing so she was instrumental in rupturing a family that I am now invited by her mother to believe was generally happy and harmonious. It does not take much imagination to realise what an enormous step A knew she was taking. She may not have envisaged that D and E would be removed from their parents&#8217; care but she knew that she, B, and C might well be. Her actions were consistent and proportionate to a genuine fear about forced marriage. The actions of B and C at that time were consistent with them also having a genuine fear about forced marriage. The sale of the house and some furniture, the Father&#8217;s travel plans, the renewal of the children&#8217;s passports, and the history of marriage within the family, will have given a context to what A, B, and C, had seen and heard within the privacy of the family home, to create these fears. </p>

The inconsistencies and retractions do bring into question some of the more florid accounts. However, the retractions have to be seen in context. A revealed that she had not expected D and E to be removed from their parents&#8217; care. She and the children were placed with a family member which would allow for messaging to be facilitated from the parents to the children. Gifts, or promises of gifts, were made to some of the children. Promises by the parents were made to change their ways. L was no longer prepared to look after the children. Children expect to be loved by their parents even parents who abuse them. These children were under great pressure to reconcile with their parents and so to retract their allegations.</p>

On the other hand, the children seem genuinely to want to return home to the Mother&#8217;s care. Even allowing for the fact that often a child will want to be cared for by a parent or parents, even when their parent(s) have mistreated them, the consistency of the expressed wishes of the children to return home since in or around December Year X is an important part of the evidence.

I am satisfied that on the balance of probabilities both parents hit the children to enforce expected behaviour within the home and that this happened on a number of occasions. I am satisfied that the evidence establishes that the parents controlled all aspects of the children&#8217;s lives: what the children wore, when they could leave the house, and what they could do within the house. They strictly enforced fasting patterns. A was compelled to be home educated and not permitted to attend school. B was told, as she reported to the police, that she would not be permitted to attend university, she was expected to undertake cooking and cleaning, and she was not permitted to go beyond the gate of the family property without a friend. I have seen pictures of books on a shelf within the home and do not find that B was not permitted to read books, although her choice of books was, I am sure, controlled.

B blames A as being entirely responsible for what happened in Year X. C, who was close to A and stayed in touch with her, was forbidden from seeing her by the Father. E&#8217;s comment that he thought that A was a thief who had stolen &#163;25,000 from his parents is telling. He must have learned that from within the family. It speaks to animosity from within the family towards A which, I am sure, was passed on to E from one or both his parents. It is poignant indeed that A held close to her a photograph of her with E on which she had written &#8220;hope&#8221; whilst her parents were poisoning E&#8217;s mind against her. </p>

I treat H&#8217;s defence statement with considerable caution &#8211; he is a convicted murderer seeking to provide himself with a defence. His assertion that he did not kill A cannot be given credence. His suggestion that somebody else committed the murder for reasons associated with Pathan culture and family honour, must be taken as an attempt to deflect responsibility. However, G shared with Ms Rattu some frank evidence about the importance of honour to certain members of the family. Also, G has put forward the suggestion that K pumped up H to murder A because &#8220;she is a very vengeful woman&#8221;. His suggestion was not at all flippant &#8211; I am satisfied that he genuinely thought K capable of encouraging or aiding the murder of A in order to gain revenge on the Father. That speaks to the deep rifts within the family and the importance to at least some of them of revenge (one of the cornerstones of Pashtunwali according to Ms Rattu). Other aspects of the story of the extended family &#8211; the deep rifts arising out of the incidents fifteen years ago, H&#8217;s behaviour to his daughter J, the cutting adrift of M, the attempted forced marriage of L, and the battles between K and her former husband, all point to the importance within the family not to lose face within their community. The history of the family also demonstrates the importance of seeking to enforce compliance with expected behaviour. Those who do not comply may be cast adrift, not being spoken to, being excluded from a home, or even being subjected to violence.</p>

The Father has been directly involved in rifts with other family members. He is said to have struck M at the time she said she wanted to marry out of the family. He threw K and others out of the family home. The Father told the police that he had warned A that if she left the home &#8220;then don&#8217;t come back&#8221;. On his own account this was when A said she wanted to stay elsewhere whilst he was away in Pakistan. His dramatic threat exposes his intolerance of any dissent from his children. They had to comply with his sense of what was right and wrong and would suffer the consequences if they did not do so. He is reported later to  have said that A was &#8220;possessed by the devil&#8221; and he &#8220;wanted nothing more to do with her.&#8221;</p>

It is not possible for me to say that he<span style="font-style:italic"> strictly</span> adhered to Pashtunwali codes. I do not think it is necessary so to find. What is important is that the father regarded himself as being required to enforce codes of conduct and expectations of behaviour within the family that he considered important and that he was aware would be regarded as honourable within his community.

There is no corroborative evidence that the Mother and Father have divorced. Even if they have divorced, there is no discernible reason why the Father should abruptly leave the country without saying farewell to his children, and then cut off all contact with them, not even letting them know of his whereabouts. I am sure that the Mother could have given the court more information about The Father&#8217;s departure and whereabouts if she so chose. He may be in hiding (I note that he disappeared not long before the trial of H was about to begin) but in the absence of frankness on the part of the Mother, and without any other evidence about his disappearance, I should not speculate. However, in December Year Y the Mother and Father told this court that they could look after the children together if they were returned home as they invited the court to order. Within a few weeks the Father had left the family home and disappeared. He left behind a wife who was extremely dependent upon him, financially and otherwise. He left a dependant adult child, B, and he left his other children not knowing where he was or why he had left. These were deeply irresponsible actions that were harmful to his children.</p>

In that spirit she blithely told the court that there were no problems within the family: A could have had a mobile phone if only she had asked. The children were free to choose what they wore and what educational paths they wished to follow. These assertions were at odds with a great deal of other evidence in the case. The Mother, I find, decided to maintain her evasion and her silence as to the true state of affairs within the family at all costs. Others have been complicit in building a wall of silence around the family in this case. Ms Rattu and Dr Khurram noted it when speaking to B. When giving oral evidence, G back-pedalled from his frankness with Ms Rattu. They have helped the Mother to keep the truth from the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question is why the Mother has so consistently misled the court, and why B and G have sought to support her in doing so. The Mother is highly vulnerable. I have made findings about her husband&#8217;s domineering and intransigent character. She was wholly dependent on him, having no financial independence, no English language, no education, unable to read or write, and living within a culture which, I find, imposed expectations on her of obedience to her husband and unquestioning support for him in his management of the children&#8217;s behaviour. The children were controlled and coerced by him and it is not difficult to imagine that the Mother was too. She has not complained of any such behaviour towards her but I take into account her considerable vulnerability. The Mother&#8217;s life for the past 20 years or so has been wholly devoted to her husband and children. Now only B remains living with her. I am sure that she would say anything to have her remaining children returned to her. Therefore, in a naive manner, she has painted a picture of a perfectly happy family when manifestly that has not been the case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment the Mother has chosen not to tell the truth to the court because of three factors &#8211; her hostility to social workers and the court interfering with her family, her deep desire to have her children returned to her, and her submission to the wishes of The Father and expectations within her community. Telling the truth would, she believes, harm her case to have her children returned. B knows the truth about the family but she is particularly hostile to the involvement of social workers and the court, and is proudly protective of her family. G wishes to support the Mother&#8211; he has been her ally in difficult times. I am sure he has more information that he could have given the court but he will only go so far. He realised that he had given too much away in his conversations with Ms Rattu and so has rowed back in a misguided attempt to protect and support the Mother.</p>

However she does so in submission to her husband and her community, as someone who is herself restricted by those values and beliefs. She has no other frame of reference. She has been wholly dependent on her husband. Her adherence is not through active choice but is a product of her conditioning and dependence. Nevertheless, by submitting to her husband so fully, and by submitting to the code of behaviour by which he and others in the community have lived, she has been a party to excessive control and abuse of her children, and she has used physical force herself to enforce her children&#8217;s compliance with expected codes of behaviour. The Mother may not even know that the control exercised by her and her husband over their children has been extreme. For her, forcing A to marry someone of her husband&#8217;s choice, preventing her daughters from attending university or seeing friends as they chose, may not have been controlling at all, but an expected parental behaviour. However, once social services and the court have become involved in her family she both knows that she should not reveal what has been going on behind closed doors, and resents their interference in her private family affairs.</p>

It does not follow that they thereby believe that revenge must involve serious violence or murder. I accept that for some within the same culture, revengeful killing is seen as a means of upholding honour. Abusive control within the family does not necessarily translate into murder of those who are perceived as bringing dishonour to the family. Each family deserves to be considered in their own terms, not given a label and then judged by the standards of others to whom that label might also apply.</p>

I am mindful that it was the defendant, H, who raised the question of A&#8217;s murder being a so-called honour killing, not the prosecution. He did so in order to implicate some other member of the family in her murder. The jury&#8217;s verdict means that they were certain so they were sure that H murdered her. As the Judge observed in his sentencing remarks, his motive was not known. I have heard speculation, but no evidence beyond that received at the Crown Court to establish (i) that anyone else was involved in the murder, or (ii) what H&#8217;s motive was for the murder. I am mindful that the standard of proof is different in this court than in the Crown Court, but findings have to be made on the basis of evidence. H might have murdered A having been encouraged or aided to do so by another member of the family. He might have murdered her as revenge for her having brought perceived dishonour to the family, but there is no evidence on which that finding could properly be made. These possibilities have been raised, but there is no evidence on which I could properly make such findings.</p>

Some evidence from the criminal trial, such as the recordings of raised voices outside the family property  might point to a loss of temper, but some of the other evidence points away from such a conclusion &#8211; for example the degree of pre-meditation described by the Judge and the fact that G was not disturbed &#8211; but I accept as a possibility that H killed A in a fit of temper and not as part of any planned revenge or punishment for bringing dishonour on the family. </p>

They include her refusal to enter into a forced marriage in Year X, her decision to inform the police of the intended forced marriage and of abusive control within the family home, her decision not to return to the family home, and her lifestyle choices after October Year X.

I have considered each of these possible reasons for his actions but have concluded that it would be too speculative to find that any of them are established on the balance of probabilities. I have also considered whether it could be said that H murdered A by reason of one or more of these five factors in the alternative. I have asked myself: if not one or more of these reasons, what was the reason for the murder? Having given the most anxious consideration to these questions I have concluded that the disciplined application of the burden and standard of proof means that I cannot reach any conclusions as to the reasons why H murdered A. He was known to be a violent man and he might well have killed A in a fit of temper unconnected with any of the matters put forward by the Local Authority. There was a thorough police investigation led by a very experienced officer very familiar with the concept of honour based abuse and violence. There was a full criminal trial before an experienced judge. H has not given any reason for why he killed A. There might be a connection between A&#8217;s actions in Year X, or her lifestyle, and his murder of her, but the evidence does not establish to the requisite standard that there was. </p>

That is not the same as a finding that the parents did in fact seek to force A, B, and C into marriage. I have returned to this earlier part of the chronology at this stage of the judgment because it is particularly important to consider all the evidence &#8211; the allegations, the retractions, the ostracisation, and the murder, before reaching conclusions about the parents&#8217; conduct in Year X. What does all the evidence now available establish about the parents&#8217; plans, if any, in relation to their three elder daughters becoming married?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Again, I have to be mindful to avoid speculation. There is no evidence of any firm marriage arrangements. However, there was a history within the wider family of marriage to first cousins, of deceit and subterfuge in relation to arranging marriages, and of family rifts and ostracisation in the event that an intended arrangement did not materialise or family expectations were thwarted. The parents&#8217; response to A was consistent with her having frustrated their plans to marry her to a man of their choice. The sale of the house and furniture, the renewal of the children&#8217;s passports, the lack of openness in informing A of plans for the family, and her evidence of discussions within the family, provide evidence that there were plans to take the family abroad. L&#8217;s evidence establishes to my satisfaction that there was at least discussion within the wider family in Pakistan of a marriage for A being planned to take place there.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> On the balance of probabilities I find that the Father and the Mother were both planning to marry A off to a first cousin in Pakistan in Year X, without her consenting to that marriage. I am not satisfied, to the requisite standard, that there were plans to force B and C into marriage at that time, but I do find that those sisters were and remain at risk of being forced into marriage. D is also at risk as she now approaches her teenage years. The risk remains because although The Father has disappeared and may well not be in England, there has been no transparency from the Mother or others about where he is and what he is doing. I am not at all persuaded that he is no longer an influence within the immediate family, over his wife, and over his children. Forced Marriage Protection Orders are still required.</p>

The Father&#8217;s intolerance of any divergence by his children from his expectations of their conduct, and the severe consequences meted out for not complying with his directions, his dealings with other members of the wider family. The parental treatment of their children up to their allegations in Year X and the ostracisation of A is consistent with the parents adopting the code of values known as Pashtunwali. However, it does not follow that the parents were prepared for A to be murdered because of her defiance of her parents or because she brought shame upon the family. </p>

Evidence before me including Dr Khurram&#8217;s evidence and the observations regarding B&#8217;s attitude to professionals, points to a complex picture of the beliefs of the remaining siblings. As to the three sisters, B, C, and D, even though they may not know why A was murdered, they will know that their parents disowned her. They will be aware that there are significant consequences to anyone within the family who fails to comply with expected codes of behaviour, or who might defy parental expectations in relation to marriage. I am sure that what happened to A will have served to make her sisters more compliant to their parents&#8217; expectations.  They would naturally be scared to resist their parents&#8217; wishes.</p>

I would add that they are at different stages of their understanding and response to the events in Year X-21 also.

Her dishonesty was due to her wish to hide evidence from the Court which she believes will be harmful to her attempt to secure the return of the children to her care, and her distrust of professionals who she believes are unjustifiably interfering with her private family life.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, my findings do not relate to any abuse within the family home after the children were returned to their parents&#8217; care in late Year X. I make no findings that the subject children have suffered significant harm, including physical harm since then. The key welfare question is what is the risk of harm to the children for the future, in the light of the findings made and the absence of any finding linking the parents or the adoption of an honour based code within the family or extended family with A&#8217;s murder. On the one hand the parents planned a forced marriage for A and engaged in excessive control including the use of physical harm on the children to enforce codes of behaviour. I have found that A was ostracised by her parents when she reported those matters and that there remains a risk of forced marriage for the other girls within the family. On the other hand, there is no evidence of any abuse within the home continuing after the children were returned to their parents&#8217; care nearly three years ago and the children say that they want to return to the family home. Perhaps the children have been cowed into silence, but there has been ample opportunity for them to reveal mistreatment and they have not done so. The evidence does not permit me to find that the parents were involved in A&#8217;s murder or that hers was an honour-based killing associated with her allegations against her parents. </p>

The primary purpose of the family process is to determine, as best that may be done, what has gone on in the past, so that that knowledge may inform the ultimate welfare evaluation where the court will choose which option is best for a child with the court's eyes open to such risks as the factual determination may have established.&#8221;</p>

Unfortunately change can take time and delay is generally adverse to the best interests of children who are the subject of family proceedings. These children have already been the subjects of interim care orders for well over a year. Nevertheless, these are complex proceedings and the decisions to be made are not clearcut, will have very serious implications, and demand proper consideration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have made serious findings against the Mother and the Father. The Father has disappeared and so the family home will be different from the one from which the children were removed in Year Y. As regards the possibility of the children returning to the family home, subject to managing the risk to the children from the Father returning or influencing the Mother and the children from a distance, the focus must be on The Mother&#8217;s ability to promote the children&#8217;s welfare and to protect them from harm. The Mother appears to have a good bond with her children when observed at the many contact sessions that have taken place over the last 15 months. She herself has been subjugated and the Father is no longer living with her. He was the controlling force within the family and so his absence is a material change which has to be taken into account. However, it is not known where he is or whether he will seek to return. The Mother has not been frank about his disappearance. She is very vulnerable and may be unable to look after the children without assistance. Regrettably, she has not been honest with the court and it is difficult to have confidence that she will engage with professionals in the future, let alone provide the sort of therapeutic parenting that Dr Khurram advises the subject children require. The influence of B is also a concern in that she appears to adopt the parenting role in place of her mother, and shows signs of copying controlling behaviours she has experienced.</p>

They would not be subject to excessive control over their education and future employment. By very reason of the unequal treatment of girls and boys within the family, they would not be at the same risk of harm if they were returned to their mother&#8217;s care. However, consideration of their welfare involves an assessment of the harmful impact on them of being raised in a culture within the family that treats girls so differently from boys, in which forced marriage is at least contemplated, in which a sister can be ostracised for defying her parents, and in which excessive control has been exercised. And if the boys were returned to their mother&#8217;s care but their sisters were not, what impact would that have upon each of the children?</p>

I have indicated that FMPO&#8217;s should continue for C and D in any event. The court could order that the children&#8217;s passports be retained and provided to the children to travel abroad only with strict protective controls in place. Injunctive orders could be made to prevent the Father from returning to the home or having any unsupervised contact with the children. With measures such as these, and continuing monitoring by and support from the Local Authority, it might be possible to find that the children, or at least the boys, can be returned safely to their mother&#8217;s care.</p>

I have said that the Mother had &#8220;chosen not to tell the truth to the court because of three factors &#8211; her hostility to social workers and the court interfering with her family, her deep desire to have her children returned to her, and her submission to the wishes of the Father and expectations within her community.&#8221; I indicated that, notwithstanding the findings made, there was an opportunity for the Mother to reflect and to be more open. I wanted her to know that she would not be penalised for being open and that if she wanted her children to be returned to her care she would in fact help her own case by being honest and open.

These further assessments were commissioned by their own lawyers (G has only subsequently become a litigant in person) and the experts chosen with the advice of those lawyers. This judgment follows the final hearing. I have received further written evidence including from Naomi Shann, Independent Childcare Consultant, who carried out the further parenting assessment of the Mother dated 13 March 2024, and Hajra Yaseen, Independent Social Worker, who carried out a Comprehensive Risk and Parenting Assessment Report in relation to G.

It is proposed that in the future B she should attend the eight sessions per year with her mother, and G should attend two of the sessions each year. In addition there is sibling only contact, which B does not attend, taking place at least once a month which is arranged and supported by the foster carers. The Guardian has proposed monthly sibling contact should continue but that, in addition to the Local Authority&#8217;s proposed eight periods of supervised family time, there should be further sibling contact involving  B, C, and D, which should take place once every two months, such contact to be reviewed on advice from any therapist(s) involved with the children.</p>

She had used it for food, electricity and other expenses. She said that she had not mentioned this money to anyone before she showed &#163;9,000 to Ms Shann during her assessment this year. She thought it would be a security risk to tell anyone. The first mention of the sum of &#163;25,000 was during her oral evidence in court. She said that the cash had come from the sale of the family&#8217;s house (which had raised &#163;70,000). She did not know where the Father had kept the cash before he handed &#163;25,000 to her. There is no evidence that he had banked the proceeds of the sale of the house. It would seem, on the Mother&#8217;s evidence, that he kept the balance of &#163;45,000 for himself. After her evidence she produced a current bank card and a very recent bank statement showing an account in her name with a payment into it of child benefit, and a payment out of &#163;5. She told me that at G&#8217;s suggestion, a few weeks ago she had made enquiries of the Father&#8217;s whereabouts in Pakistan, contacting her father and brother who live there. No members of the family in Pakistan had had any contact with him.

I can see why members of the family might think she is rather hard on them but this has been borne of significant concerns about pressure being put on the children by members of the family. She was unbending in her evidence and she demonstrated a desire to stick to rules and procedures. She was so anxious to impress upon the court the extent of the risk of harm to the children that she struggled to articulate the possible disadvantages of long term foster care or the advantages to the children of returning to their mother&#8217;s care, or of maintaining more frequent contact with the Mother and B than is set out in the Local Authority&#8217;s plans.</p>

In the Mother&#8217;s mind A displayed behavioural difficulties which caused problems for the family in Year X. The Mother is incredulous about professionals&#8217; resurrection of the concerns in the previous proceedings, and the recent finding that &#8220;the Father and the Mother were both planning to marry A off to a first cousin in Pakistan in Year X, without her consenting to that marriage&#8221;. She wholly rejects this fact and similarly that there have been any concerns within the wider family around forced marriage.  </p>

I am concerned about her lack of attention to A following the Year X proceedings.

In previous evidence to the Court the Mother stated that &#8220;the door was always open&#8221; when challenged that A was ostracised. Subsequently the family narrative changed with B asserting that her parents did have contact with A and that the whole family would gather for special occasions.  </p>

Women&#8217;s Aid explains that &#8220;Coercive control creates invisible chains and a sense of fear that pervades all elements of a victim&#8217;s life. It works to limit their human rights by depriving them of their liberty and reducing their ability for action. Experts like Evan Stark liken coercive control to being taken hostage. As he says: &#8220;the victim becomes captive in an unreal world created by the abuser, entrapped in a world of confusion, contradiction and fear.&#8221; </p>

It is unclear who now receives child benefit for the children, but the Mother no longer has a bank card. She has no record of any bills, and her estimates of expenditure are simply unrealistic. It is my view that other person/s are in fact controlling the family finances. The Mother remains vulnerable because at some point her cash will run out. She does not speak English, cannot read or write in any language, never travels alone. Accessing welfare benefits will be difficult for the Mother to navigate.  </p>

This is un-verified, and he could equally be living in N and simply avoiding the ongoing Court process. The allegations made against him by H whilst under criminal investigation may have something to do with his disappearance. However, H has subsequently been convicted and there is no criminal investigation ongoing in relation to the Father. I would argue that this makes it more likely the Father would return to the UK where he has always lived and re-connect with family. The Father poses an unassessed risk which cannot be mitigated because there is a lack of transparency from the family. I find it difficult to believe that the Mother does not know more of the Father&#8217;s whereabouts. Even if he is in Pakistan, it should be noted that the Father is part of the Mother&#8217;s extended family, they are cousins. I would have assumed that if the Father had genuinely vanished with no trace that the Mother and the family would have reported him missing to the authorities, especially considering the assertion that his mental health was badly affected by social care involvement.  </p>

Observations of supervised contact indicate that the Mother is caring and prepares meals for the children. She is also warm and genuinely enjoys her time with the children. However, the Mother finds some aspects of parenting more difficult. For example, emotionally connecting, sustaining play and interaction. She is dominated by B who takes a lead in terms of the parenting role. The Mother has found it difficult to accept advice from professionals to develop her parenting skills. Within this assessment she has reluctantly trialled ideas but is evidently indignant and seeking to pacify the assessor rather than engage in reflective learning around parenting strategies. I have seen no evidence of advanced skills to be able to emotionally support the children through multiple losses. The Mother finds it hard to maintain a meaningful dialogue with the children and there are awkward silences.  </p>

Her absence from A&#8217;s life is a stark example of this and it is apparent that at times the Mother has kept quiet and conformed to maintain the peace with her husband and wider family. Another example of this is within the previous proceedings B disclosed how her mother would &#8220;snitch&#8221; on them to their father to safeguard her own position. There are concerns that the Mother has sought to protect herself and in doing so has neglected her child/ren.  The situation is complicated because the Mother is so vulnerable herself but her ability to protect is grossly compromised. Additionally, there are concerns that the Mother would resort to controlling and abusive parenting practices if faced with stress which would be likely if any of the children challenged the boundaries or deviated from what was expected of them.  </p>

She dismissed that suggestion saying that there were striking factors in this case, citing the findings of abuse and risk of forced marriage, and the ostracisation of A. She said that she tried to give the Mother space and time to at least discuss the effects of the court&#8217;s findings and of certain expectations being imposed on the children, rather than to seek to persuade her that she had to make significant changes, but the Mother was simply &#8220;not willing to go there.&#8221; </p>

Ms Shann  accepted that the layout of her report could have been changed but pointed to the fact that she had discussed B&#8217;s beliefs and role in detail in the report. That is so: Ms Shann has addressed at some length B&#8217;s adoption of the same narrative about A as her mother, her leading &#8220;parenting&#8221; role during contact, and her strong denials that there was anything of concern in the family dynamics prior to A&#8217;s allegations in Year X (which, of course, B supported at the time). Ms Shann has not focused on the practical care for the children that the Mother could give, supported by B, but on the risks to the children from the exercise of control and the enforcement of rules of conduct and expectations. She does not believe that any of the suggested support network, including B, could act as a protective force for the benefit of the children. She actively considered the Resolutions approach, in which she is trained and experienced, but considered that it was not appropriate to the present case: there was no sufficient support network, the Mother was not prepared to work with therapists or other professionals, and the findings of fact went to the very core of the family dynamics rather than being related to a discrete, manageable risk. </p>

It is the status of being a looked after child that she hates. Rather like the experience of Ms S, when the Guardian has discussed with C, D, and E the prospect of remaining in foster care rather than returning home, they have been accepting and not distressed. Similarly, the suggestion that family time might be reduced, even significantly, has not produced upset or objections from those children. She was cross-examined about the lack of detailed notes of such conversations, but she said that she does not note every aspect of the conversations down. She was confident when giving her evidence about the children&#8217;s reactions.</p>

The court should first make a careful assessment of the likelihood of future harm to the child, and must then weigh that harm against the harm that would follow from the child being removed from his parents under a care order.

What that common approach should be has been determined through consultation and discussion by the multidisciplinary membership of the PLWG. The recommendations at paragraphs 158 to 162, and the Best Practice Guidance at paragraphs 34 to 37, of the PLWG March 2021 report, and Appendix C of the April 2023 report on supervision orders, which have already had extra-curial endorsement, I now formally endorse in a judgment of this court. They must be applied in all cases. The approach taken by the PLWG is no more than the logical development of the earlier caselaw, once account is taken of the need for proportionality and once it is understood that, following Re DE, there are only procedural differences between the power of removal where there is a care order or where there is none. As Hale J/LJ made plain, it has never been the case that a care order should be used as a means to ensure that a local authority meets the duties that it has with respect to children in need in its area, nor should it be used to influence the deployment of resources.</p>

Mr Howling KC, Mr Bickler KC and Ms Mason for The Mother, B, and C respectively, urged the court to look beyond the independent reports and consider the balance of harm which, they said, the Local Authority, Guardian, and independent assessors had got wrong. Mr Bickler KC submitted that B&#8217;s role as part of a potentially protective support network had been overlooked. A jaundiced view of the Pashtun culture and unjustified continuing suspicions that the parents had been involved in A&#8217;s murder had prevailed.

Specifically, I previously found that the Mother had shown an unbending reluctance to open up her family to scrutiny. In other circumstances this might be justified &#8211; no-one would wish to have social workers, experts, and the court, pouring over their private lives &#8211; but in the circumstances of a murder within the family, forced marriage protection orders, a husband who has disappeared without trace, and her children under 18 being in foster care, the time had surely come for the Mother to be more open and honest, and to address professionals&#8217; concerns. Quite clearly, she has decided not to do so but instead to deflect, to remain silent, and to deny. </p>

Firstly, she flatly denies the truth of any of the findings of fact that I have made. Secondly, her account of an almost idyllic family life prior to the events of Year X is wholly incredible given what A and the other children did and said at that time. Their allegations did not spring out of nowhere. Thirdly, Ms Shann has produced a very thorough assessment after having spent considerable time with the Mother and has concluded that the Mother was not honest with her. Fourthly, I have previously found that she has not been open and honest about the Father&#8217;s disappearance and her more recent evidence only serves to add weight to that finding. She has, only now, told the court that that the Father gave her &#163;25,000 in cash before he left. She did not mention that at the last hearing. She showed Ms Shann &#163;9,000 in cash earlier this year. This followed discussions about finances in which, Ms Shann considered, the Mother had not been honest. She had not previously revealed that she held large amounts of cash to anyone. </p>

However, Ms Shann went out of her way to adopt an approach that would allow someone with the Mother&#8217;s disadvantages to engage and the Mother refused to engage. I do not accept that she is unable to tell professionals and the court more about what she knows and what she has witnessed. I conclude that she has chosen not to do so. Mr Howling KC raised the possibility that the Mother has an undiagnosed cognitive impairment or other condition which might limit her emotional intelligence and capacity for empathy. However, there is no evidence of such condition. The Mother has been ably represented by solicitors, experienced Junior Counsel and another KC prior to Mr Howling&#8217;s involvement, and no report on her cognitive abilities has been suggested. She shows emotional warmth with the children at supervised family time sessions. She appeared to me to answer questions freely albeit through an interpreter. Ms Shann adopted the ParentAssess model which she has experience of using for parents with learning disability. I do not accept any suggestion that the Mother&#8217;s failure to be frank about her family is due to an undiagnosed cognitive or other impairment.</p>

There is no evidence that any of the children suffered physical harm in their parents&#8217; care once returned in 2021. Notes of family time sessions describe a loving bond between the children and their mother, and also with B who continues to live at home with the Mother. B and G could offer practical and emotional support to the Mother which would help her to care for the children.

It would, save for family time arrangements, remove each child from the Mother and eldest surviving sister and the two pairs of child siblings from each other. It would override the wishes of the two daughters who are currently in foster care. C has expressed a strong wish to go home. D wishes to go home. C is very nearly 16 and her wishes carry significant weight. I have to take into account the possibility that she could &#8220;vote with her feet&#8221;. I have to consider the possible effect on D were C to leave the foster placement prematurely. I have to consider life for D in long term foster care after C turns 18 when she has said she will leave (if she has not done before then) leaving D on her own. Foster care placements are not guaranteed to last throughout a child&#8217;s minority. As for the two young boys, long term foster care carries with it a greater risk of changes of placement than for the older girls. F could be in foster care for over 15 years. The boys are in a placement that is not a cultural match and I must consider the impact on them of being separated not only from their family but from being surrounded by their family&#8217;s religion and culture.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The history of events has been characterised the Mother, B, and G as being one that does not give rise to a risk to the children. Counsel for the Mother and B recognise that the position is more complex but in essence submit that there is a relatively low, and manageable level of risk involved in the children returning to family care. The argument runs as follows. First, the court was satisfied in 2021 that it was safe for the children to be returned home. Second, there is no evidence that the children came to harm at home between then and their removal under interim care orders in Year Y. Third, the court has found that there is no evidence linking the Mother and Father to A&#8217;s murder. If it was safe for the children to be returned home in 2021, and there is no evidence of harm being caused by the parents thereafter, certainly not by the Mother, how can there be a significant risk to the children now? </p>

I acknowledge that they relate to events prior to the court allowing the children to return home in 2021 but my findings were based on the totality of the evidence and they have not been challenged. These findings included that the Father and the Mother planned to force A into marriage, that they subjected their children to ill-treatment and excessive control within the family home, that when A defied them she acted contrary to the codes of values and beliefs by which her parents lived and her defiance was considered by them to be shameful to the family, that they ostracised her as a consequence, that she exposed herself to the risk of harm by defying them and the codes by which they lived, and that they failed to protect her.</p>

I found that the Father adhered to codes of behaviour within Pashtun culture which he thought to be important and that his &#8220;conduct with other family members, his control of his daughters, his responses to being disobeyed, his conduct in ostracising A is consistent with adherence to codes of behaviour within Pashtun culture.&#8221; The Mother may herself be a victim of this family culture, or even a wider culture within parts of her community, but through conditioning or otherwise, she too has been party to exercising excessive control over the children, including by the use of physical force, and she was party to the plan to force A into marriage. She too ostracised A and still blames her for the division of her family.</p>

A&#8217;s murder was the most extreme example but it was not wholly isolated. There has previously been violence, threats, and ostracisation. H has not been the sole perpetrator of harm and his incarceration does not end the risk of harm to women and children within this family, in particular any who might be regarded as disobedient. The fact that we do not know what H&#8217;s motive was does not mean that there was no motive. I do not regard the fact that there was a murder within the family the motive for which is unknown, as particularly reassuring in terms of ongoing risk to the children. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The ostracisation of A was very significant for these children and has to be viewed in the context of the children&#8217;s involvement in what preceded it. Their parents were having no contact with their eldest sister. B, C, and to a lesser extent D, had initially supported A. They had not wanted to go back to their parents. I have found that this was not some childish game, but that the reports they made were sincere. For them to have turned against their parents must have been a hugely significant step for them all to take for the reasons articulated to me by Mrs Yaseen and previously by Ms Rattu. I have found that the children&#8217;s allegations against their parents in Year X were largely true. Under pressure the girls retracted some but not all of their allegations but A chose to live outside the immediate family and she suffered the consequence &#8211; ostracisation. I have no doubt that this would have been seen by A&#8217;s sisters (her brothers were both too young at the time) as a punishment for defying her parents. In the context of a family in which there was ill-treatment of the children who were excessively controlled, it would have made a powerful impact on C, D and E, to see how A was dealt with when she defied her parents and would not return to the fold. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">When considering harm to the children&#8217;s emotional welfare and the risk of further harm of that kind, it is important to view the dramatic events in this case from their point of view. Their sister was murdered after having defied their parents and wider family. She was murdered by a family member. Their parents blamed A for breaking up the family. They had ostracised her. I confirm that there is no evidence to link them to her murder but, from the perspective of C and D, there will be many questions with which they have grappled and will have to grapple in the future. Why are they not believed, why was A blamed, and why was she ostracised? Who can they trust? Who could they turn to if they needed help or wanted to raise concerns about a parent or elder sister? Unfortunately there are no easy answers. Adding to their emotional difficulties and the risk of future emotional harm is the fact that the Mother, B, and G do not accept the findings of the court and therefore do not accept that the children had told the truth about abuse within the home. Any child of C or D&#8217;s ages would think twice before saying anything negative about their family.  There is also the risk that if E and F were to grow up in the same environment, they too would become reluctant to disclose anything untoward outside the family. They will surely learn more about what happened to A and her ostracisation by her parents. They will be liable to have the same questions as their sisters.</p>

He left without speaking to the children. The children do not know where he is or what has happened to him. It seems remarkable that there appears to be so little anxiety amongst the adults in the family as what has happened to him if truly there has been no sight or sound of him for about a year. But to the children who have already lost their eldest sister, and had a family member jailed for her murder (C and D already know he has been convicted) the disappearance of the Father with no obvious explanation must have delivered another emotional blow. Again, there are no easy answers for them &#8211; the circumstances of and reasons for his disappearance are unclear. He could have been present at the thrice weekly contact but he has chosen to leave them. Why would a loving father abandon them in this way? Why would he abandon their mother?</p>

Indeed she has only now revealed that he handed over &#163;25,000 in cash to her at the time, something she chose not to mention at the previous hearing. I am primarily reliant of the Mother for evidence as to the circumstances of the Father&#8217;s disappearance, his lack of contact with her, and the absence of information about his whereabouts, but she is not a reliable witness. The Father has been instrumental in exercising excessive control within the family, ill-treating the children, ostracising A, and then abandoning the family in early 2023. The fact that the court does not know where he is, what he is doing, or whether in truth he has contact with the Mother or others, is troubling and a further source of risk to the safety and wellbeing of the children. The Father has responded to difficulties and conflict in the past by seeking to throw members of his family out of their home, ostracising his vulnerable daughter, and disappearing from the lives of his surviving children without notice. He is prone to extreme actions and the children&#8217;s welfare would be at risk were he to have influence over them. I cannot exclude the possibility that he continues to have some control over the Mother because I cannot trust her evidence that he has no direct or indirect contact with her.</p>

Her assurances cannot be relied upon. She is, I find, unlikely to engage meaningfully with professionals. She may let them into the house as she has done consistently, but to date she has not engaged in meaningful dialogue with professionals and has not been open with the court. She will be unwilling or unable to support the children through any therapeutic process they become involved in (which it appears to be agreed C, D, and E need now). She will be unable or unwilling to report concerns about the children&#8217;s welfare or safety to professionals because she is hostile to professional involvement in her family&#8217;s life. Her attitude is entrenched and means that attempts to put in place protective measures including injunctive orders are unlikely to be effective.</p>

Ms Shann and Ms S have noted how B has used the narrative of events, sometimes using very similar wording, as her mother. According to her, there are no grounds for concern about the children, the family was happy together, A led her and her sisters astray in Year X, the social workers, Ms S in particular, have imagined problems that do not exist and have ruined the family by tearing it apart without cause. G has very similar views, albeit he accepts that concerns over the children&#8217;s safety were justified when A went missing and then when her body was found. I do not regard him as a potentially effective protective force for the children because he, like B, is aligned with the Mother&#8217;s wholly unconvincing account of family life and the children&#8217;s experiences. I have to take into account that there are no family members who understand, or are willing to admit that they understand, the harm done to the children and the risk of future harm.</p>

The task of processing everything that has happened will be a difficult one for them to negotiate. For C and D that processing will have started and they need therapeutic intervention to help them. E would benefit from therapeutic intervention now also. All four children will need support either to go through therapy or otherwise to process past events, even F as he grows up. If they were returned home to the Mother&#8217;s care, or were placed into G&#8217;s care, they would be cared for by someone who did not accept the truth of what has happened in the past and could not provide them with the environment and support they need for them to heal emotionally and to develop as young people and then into adulthood with sound emotional and mental health.</p>

Given the history within the family of deceit in relation to marriage arrangements and the need for forced marriage protection orders, E and F may well be at direct risk from being forced into marriages chosen by others when they are older. I accept that they are too young now to be at any risk of forced marriage, and that the risk may be less for them as young men than it is for C and D now and over the next few years. E and F also risk being exposed to a family culture in which, as I have previously found, women and girls receive differential treatment and had their everyday behaviour regulated to the extent that it amounts to significant harm.</p>

She is nearly 16, is an intelligent and thoughtful young woman, and her wishes and feeling must carry significant weight. D has also said, albeit with less force than C, that she wishes to return home. However, the Guardian and Ms S have both told me that C and D were accepting of advice that the Local Authority&#8217;s proposal was likely to be for them to remain in their foster placement. I recognise the possibility that they were simply being compliant and polite, but Ms S in particular has got to know the children very well and the evidence suggests to me that C would express an opinion if she felt the need to do so. The children all seem to be settled in their placements and to be able to enjoy themselves living there. Their wishes for family time are not as strong as the adult family members might wish. C has expressed a wish not to have family time during her examination period this Spring/Summer. When B was applying for more sibling contact time, D initially said that did not want more contact. I am mindful of the pressures on C and D and the difficulty each may have in being oppositional to their family. E appears to separate his family life from life at his foster placement and has expressed his happiness with living at each. He has appeared to accept with equanimity the prospect of an order that he remains in his foster placement long term, but he will not have the level of understanding of what that would mean that his sisters have. F enjoys family time but is also happy and settled in his foster placement. At supervised family time he often gravitates towards B.</p>

They are all reasonably healthy. C is undertaking GCSEs this summer and is clearly a very conscientious and ambitious student who is likely to do well. It is an important time in her education. I have referred to the emotional needs of the children earlier in this judgment. I also refer to the expert evidence of Dr Khurram who has advised on the particular emotional vulnerabilities of each child and that they are each at a different stage in processing the traumatic events that have had such a grave impact on them. C has voiced thoughts of self-harming. Dr Khurram&#8217;s analysis is troubling and underlines the impact of the dramatic events of the past few years on the children&#8217;s mental and emotional health. They will each, at different times perhaps, need skilled support. F may not need support now &#8211; he is too young to be able to engage -  but he may need further support, even professional support, later in his  childhood. Dr Khurram advised that, &#8220;In my opinion, B living with the children could be traumatizing at present, she tends to &#8220;present&#8221; herself in a way to portray she is coping, and things are going okay, and this may lead to dysregulation on part of C in particular as B uses religion very much as a way coping. Whereas, if she were to find out that C was self-harming she may be punitive/shaming towards her in that this is not an acceptable way of behaving as a Muslim.  Thereby again increasing the chances of C becoming isolated.&#8221; The children need support, time, and space, free from interference, to heal and to develop. </p>

F has spent most of his life in his placement. If the children were returned home that would be likely to be disruptive initially for all the children. C, however, has said that she wants to go home and although I treat what she has said with some caution, I accept that, provided any change in residence occurred after her current GCSEs, there would be no significant detriment to her from having to make the change itself. I do not believe that the change itself would be detrimental for D other than in the short term. The change itself might be much more problematic for E and F who are much younger and who have been in their foster placement for a much greater proportion of their short lives. I also take into account that a care order with a plan for long term foster care is no guarantee that the children will remain with the same carers throughout their childhood &#8211; disruptive change might be suffered by them if a care order is made with a plan for long term foster care. Furthermore, on the Local Authority plans, there would be a marked change in family time with a radical reduction in contact with the Mother and B in particular. I shall address the specific issue of contact later in this judgment, but the reduction in contact would be a change that will be initially difficult for all the children to deal with.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-style:italic">Any harm which the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering</span>: the children have suffered harm as I have found in my earlier judgment. I have addressed the risks of harm in this judgment.  Stepping back and considering the extent of the risk of harm, it seems to me that whilst the Guardian did not consider that there was a risk of physical harm, there does remain a risk of the use of slapping or other physical chastisement to maintain control over the children if they are returned home. There is no evidence that physical chastisement was used after the children were returned home in 2021 but the risk has not been extinguished.  The greater risk is that the children would be excessively restricted, they would suffer emotional ill-treatment, they would be coerced and controlled in many aspects of their lives, and they would fear the consequences of disobedience. Furthermore they have suffered emotional harm as a result of all the traumatic events they have been through and that harm will continue unless they are fully supported to deal with that harm. The girls are, I find, at an ongoing risk of forced marriage. The unknown whereabouts of the Father do not reassure me in that respect. The boys may be at risk of forced marriage when they are older, although that risk is relatively slight. If the children were to defy the Mother or go against the expectations of the wider family on a matter of importance to her or the wider family, then there is a risk that they would suffer harmful consequences as punishment or attempts to enforce compliance. A suffered harmful consequences when she was ostracised. The children, including the boys as they develop, may well believe that they have to comply otherwise they will suffer severe penalties for not complying.</p>

He has not been assessed for the purpose of this final hearing. He may not presently be in the children&#8217;s lives but, if they were returned home, he might turn up the day after. Given the findings I have made about him and his conduct in absenting himself from the proceedings and his children, I conclude that he is not at all capable of meeting the children&#8217;s needs. There is a risk that he has continuing influence which would prevent others from meeting the children&#8217;s needs. The Mother can meet the children&#8217;s basic needs such as food, clothing and housing. She also has a loving bond with the children. She is not guilty of unremitting cruelty to the children. I accept that she longs to look after them in the way she knows which includes providing for them and cuddling them. However, for the reasons set out above and, in particular, in Ms Shann&#8217;s report, I conclude that the Mother has been a perpetrator of abuse of the children, she presents a risk of repeating such conduct because she has not learned from the past, she is not capable of protecting the children from the risk of coercion and control by others, nor is she capable or of meeting the complex emotional needs that arise from the traumatic events these children have been through. Indeed, given the findings I have made and the fact that she wholly rejects them, I conclude that she remains a threat to the children&#8217;s emotional welfare. </p>

Specific injunctive or other measures would only be properly effective if those living with the children wanted them to be effective.

When weighing the specific matters in the welfare checklist and all the circumstances, I have to consider which factors carry particular weight. This case has some complexity but the central, most important feature is the dominant feature of coercion and control within this family, by which I mean the immediate family and the wider family. This is a culture that permeates just about all aspects of this family&#8217;s life. It has manifested itself sometimes through physical violence, sometimes by inducement, sometimes by emotional abuse. The findings that I have made reflect this culture within the family and its harmful consequences for the children. This is not to say that there is no affection with the family. Sadly affection can sit alongside coercion and control &#8211; indeed it can be a tool of coercion and control. The effects of this core culture within the family have been devastating for the children, giving rise to the series of traumatic events I have already described. They have been damaged by those events and the exercise of coercion and control within their family. I repeat that there is no evidence of parental involvement in A&#8217;s murder but she was murdered by the H at a time when her parents had ostracised her, when she had removed herself from her home due to their plans to force her to marry and their excessive control over her. They did not protect her when she was vulnerable, and instead pushed her away. I refer again to these matters because the Mother, B, and G appear not to appreciate the impact of everything that has happened on the children, nor, in the Mother&#8217;s case, her responsibility for much of what has occurred.</p>

Dr Khurram has highlighted concerns about C&#8217;s emotional and mental health and the risk that she might be regarded as an outcast by the family by reason of her past association with A. She has been very guarded and fearful at times. She must be allowed to heal emotionally and I do not consider that she could do that whilst living with the Mother or G. I believe that she will choose to stay with her foster carers unless pressure is put upon her by the family or she puts pressure on herself to comply with what she knows the family want of her. If she remains in foster care, I do not think it would be in her best interests to lay out a pathway to return home. What she needs is space to make her own choices free from expectations which, in the context of her life experiences, come with the threat of coercion and control.</p>

He had a negative narrative about her that was at odds with the truth, as I have found. He has now visited her grave and his views about her appear to be changing. He seems to be happy in his placement but is a boy happy to be in the company of his family also. I find that if he were now to be cared for within the family, his development would regress and he would be pulled back into the deceit and twisted narrative about his late sister and the family. His emotional health would be at significant risk. </p>

I am sure that it is important for his welfare that he remains living with E and that he has contact with his siblings, C and D. He is settled in foster care and appears to have a very good relationship with his carers. I fully understand the submission that returning him to his mother&#8217;s care would not place him at sufficient risk of harm to justify any other order. He is too young to be at risk of forced marriage or for excessive control to be imposed on him now in relation to his behaviour. However I have to think of the permanency provisions and I have highlighted the risks involved in returning F to family care. Placing F on his own or with one or more other siblings with G is not a solution that would meet his best interests &#8211; G is not capable of providing for F&#8217;s needs, as Mrs Yaseen has concluded. Were F to be returned to his mother&#8217;s care she would provide for him and nurture him, but I am sorry to conclude that he would be exposed to a significant risk of harm from the matters set out earlier in this judgment. Furthermore, if separated from E he would suffer considerable emotional harm.   </p>

As it is, she has wholly denied any of the findings made, and discounts all the concerns about the children&#8217;s safety and welfare that the court and multiple professionals have raised. I give considerable weight to her disregard for any concerns about the children&#8217;s welfare arising from the events of the past few years and the findings of the court. It is not that the court is fixated with requiring &#8220;acceptance&#8221; of its findings. Rather, the findings that have been made go to the heart of the culture within this family and if there is no acknowledgement within the family of even the basis for the findings made, there is no opportunity to work on effecting change so that the best interests of the children can be protected and enhanced.</p>

There is currently a degree of stability for these children which has been lacking for some time. But most importantly they are protected from the harmful control exercised within the family and the family home. Nevertheless, long term foster care would be unlikely to be regarded as serving any of the children&#8217;s best interests if, as an alternative, they could be returned home with any risks of harm contained at a manageable and acceptable level.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A care order placing any of the children in long term foster care may only be made if it is necessary and proportionate. Having reviewed all the evidence in this case, my conclusions accord with the comprehensive, independent assessments of Ms Shann and Mrs Yaseen with which the Guardian and the Local Authority agree. I regard the risk of harm to each child from being returned to their mother&#8217;s care as being unacceptably high and that there is no mitigation that could be put in place to reduce the risks to an acceptable level. The current absence of the Father is not a reassurance in this respect, particularly since the Mother has not been open about his seeming disappearance. In any event, I have found her to be personally responsible for various forms of abuse as set out in the findings of fact. G and B would not offer any protection to the children from the harm to which they would be exposed. Other protective measures such as an exclusion order would not be sufficiently effective to mitigate the harm in my opinion. Placement with G would also expose the children to an unacceptable risk of harm. That has been the conclusion of a number of professionals. I have anxiously considered whether there is a way to return the children, or any of them, to the family but I am unable to find that their best interests would be met by such an order. Consideration of the balance of harm lies firmly in favour of permanently removing the four children from family care and in favour of the children being placed in long term foster care. That is the option that is in the best interests of each child. My conclusion is that it is necessary for the safety and emotional welfare of the children, and proportionate to the risk of harm, for each of them to be removed from their parents&#8217; care and to be placed in long term foster care.</p>

The risks to them of forced marriage remain. The attention on the family and the care orders made reduce the risks but the girls are a little older and that increases the risk. Importantly, the fact that I do not know anything about The Father&#8217;s whereabouts, his connections, or his current intentions is an additional risk factor that has arisen since the FMPOs were first made. I have found that the Father and the Mother planned to force A into marriage. I have considered the Article 3 and 8 Convention rights that are engaged. The FMPOs should remain in force for the period indicated. Applications to discharge the FMPOs may be made as and when circumstances change. </p>

The Local Authority is neutral as to her application. I have concerns about removing the protection that the order affords but on balance I am now satisfied that she would resist pressure to marry against her will and would find a way to alert authorities if that were to happen. She would be able to keep herself safe without the need for an order which she does not want. She knows that she could contact the Local Authority, the police, or her school if she needed any help. B has not had an easy relationship with Ms S but I would encourage the Local Authority to give B a point of contact she could use if she needed to. The risks to B are reduced by the fact that there has been so much focus on the family. Her wish as a capacitous adult is for the order to be discharged. No other party has opposed that request.
