	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned in this case with SR who is now 4 and half years of age. She has recently started full time education here in the UK and has been in foster care since October 2013.  Initially that placement was under the aegis of a Police Protection Order, subsequently under an agreement between the mother and the Local Authority pursuant to S20 of The Children Act 1989.  An interim care order was made on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2014, renewed on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August and has continued to date.  The child&#8217;s mother is JC an American citizen and as such SR gains her own entitlement to American citizenship.  The father, MR, is a Moroccan citizen.  The case has been listed before me to determine the question of SR&#8217;s &#8216;habitual residence&#8217;.  On the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2014, during the course of the care proceedings, Her Honour Judge Cox noted at para 6 of her order :</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2014 when the case came before the High Court, Mr Justice Cobb listed the matter for hearing on the first available dates, 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> -28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2015.  I also made further directions at a short hearing on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2015 both in relation to the filing of expert evidence concerning the jurisdictional issue and in the public law care proceedings.  It is important to record that the care proceedings have continued to progress entirely independently of this issue.  That has occurred not on any assumption that jurisdiction will be found to be here in the UK (that simply would have not been possible on the facts of this case) but in accordance with key principles of the Children Act 1989 i.e. the imperative to avoid delay in decisions relating to children and to keep in focus the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration pursuant to section 1 (1).  That said, there is an obvious tension within such logic.  If I find that this court does not have jurisdiction much of the time and effort deployed by a variety of professionals will, in all likelihood, prove to have been of much lesser value, at best.   More importantly, there will be significant consequential delay which can only be seriously damaging to SR herself.  None of this however must have any bearing on the task I am required to undertake.  I must determine jurisdiction by investigating the facts, in the context of the framework of the law, to identify where SR is &#8216;habitually resident&#8217;.  This is not a welfare exercise and I have cautioned myself throughout to resist the gravitational pull of &#8216;welfare&#8217; to the family lawyer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I must emphasise that where there is, as here, obvious potential for a jurisdictional issue, protracted periods under section 20 voluntary arrangements are highly undesirable.  For my part, I simply cannot see how it was ever thought that such an arrangement was appropriate in this case.  It has led to avoidable delay and has proved to be inimical to SR&#8217;s welfare.  Moreover, the objective within care proceedings must always be to consider any conflict of jurisdiction at the earliest stages and, if the matter needs to be tried, it should be so expeditiously.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the course of the hearing I heard evidence from the mother here in London in the witness box.  I also took the father&#8217;s evidence from Morocco by tele-videolink.  It was not possible to see the father but we were able to hear him clearly.  He gave his evidence in a mixture of Moroccan Arabic dialect, classical Arabic and English.  Though, of course, French is also spoken widely in Morocco, this was the language that he felt least comfortable with.  The translator here in the court room moved with impressive facility through all the available options.  I record these matters because they will, ultimately, play some part in my investigation of the factual issues.   The mother speaks English with a barely detectable American accent and she described her French, the only other language she speaks, as &#8220;risibly poor&#8221;.  Though the mother had gleaned a few Arabic phrases, she and the father communicated in French and English.  Inevitably, therefore, communication between the two must, at times, have been difficult.</p>

The grandparents reasoning ultimately seeks to inveigle me into a comparative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the child protection system in New York State with those of England and Wales.  As such it is misconceived, not least because both systems require an intense focus on the welfare of the individual child which, logically, cannot be achieved by systemic comparison.   In addition, I am bound to observe that, even on the most superficial survey of the conventional welfare indicators (e.g. degree of connection with USA or with family members there) the argument for New York as the forum conveniens is threadbare. I detected a recognition by the grandparents of the weakness of this point.  As a fall back position, they contend that the English courts &#8216;should determine SR&#8217;s future&#8217;. They are, for a variety of reasons, very resistant to the Moroccan courts being found to have jurisdiction.  Ultimately, they are distressed grandparents trying to protect their family in any way they can.  Mr Williams, in his document, has put their case elegantly and creatively.</p>

This case involves four American citizens.  There have been concurrent criminal proceedings, to which I will refer below; there are continuing care proceedings as well as this important jurisdictional issue.  The Local Authority objected to Consular staff attending on the basis that the request had been made on the premise that they should &#8216;observe&#8217;, without identifying any particular purpose or objective.  It is, to my mind, inherently desirable that these proceedings, involving inter jurisdictional issues and the incursion of the state into family life should be both open and transparent to reassure the American Embassy and more widely, that proper process has been observed.  In this context I think it important to add that the mother, herself an American citizen, though with indefinite leave to remain here in the United Kingdom, has been afforded representation, at public expense, by both leading and junior counsel.  </p>

There is no doubt that this was a serious and potentially life threatening episode.  Enquiry undertaken by Police and Children Services concluded that SR was likely to have suffered significant harm in consequence of excessive physical restraint used by the mother.  Swelling and bruising were noted to SR&#8217;s right cheek, at the hospital, and bruising to her chest and right thigh.  The mother admitted using inappropriate and physical chastisement to her three year old daughter and was arrested on the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October.  She was subjected to bail conditions which included a prohibition on unsupervised contact with her daughter (a fact which potentially has relevance when contemplating Article 7 (1) (b) of the 1996 Hague Convention).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the course of the care proceedings two important assessments have been filed which I have borne in mind when evaluating the mother&#8217;s oral evidence at this hearing.  Firstly, a parenting assessment, dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2014, which included information from the mother that she felt herself, at times, to be &#8216;overwhelmed&#8217; by her own mental health issues.  She recognised that on those occasions there would be extended periods of time where she felt unable to respond to her daughter.  Secondly, an assessment undertaken by a multi disciplinary team which included a psychiatrist and psychologist at the Anna Freud Centre.  The conclusions of that assessment may not be accepted by the mother in the context of the care proceedings, though I have the strong sense, as I listened to her in evidence, that there was much within the report that resonated accurately for her.  I have however found it helpful to have both reports in mind when trying to evaluate her reliability.   I should say that the report&#8217;s usefulness to me largely lies in offering alternative explanations to what might otherwise appear to be lies on the mother&#8217;s part.  The following paragraph within the filed report is of significance:</p>

In relation to Narcissistic personality Disorder she shows a grandiose sense of self, a belief that she is special and unique, a sense of entitlement, lack of empathy and the belief that others are envious of her.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father, MR, did not make any effort to contact the Court on the first day of the hearing, nor had he communicated with his solicitors for a considerable period of time.  In particular, he had failed to respond to what I was told were daily e-mails and telephone calls in the week prior to the commencement of this hearing.  Accordingly, no video link had been arranged, no translator instructed and, most significantly of all, the father had not signed his statement prepared by his solicitors on his behalf.  With respect to Mr Feehan I could not see how he could regard himself as continuing to be properly instructed in those circumstances.  However I pressed the solicitors to renew their efforts to contact the father.  Luckily they were able to do so and to put satisfactory arrangements in place for him to give evidence.  Concurrently to his disengagement with the legal process the father had also stopped participating in the arranged Skype contact with his daughter, in approximately mid-December 2014.  The explanation offered was that the Skype facility had broken on his computer.  He did not inform anybody of this, he merely fell silent.  I am afraid that I am driven to conclude that all this reflects adversely on his commitment to his daughter and on his understanding of the impact on her, a child in foster care, of her father disappearing.  I am told she had enjoyed the contact. I cannot help but note that this is a pattern of behaviour.  I also find that it casts light on his conduct during the period which I have been considering when investigating the relevant factual issues involved in determining SR&#8217;s &#8216;habitual residence&#8217;.</p>

Some of these are objective: how long were they there, what were their living conditions while there, were they at school or at work, and so on? But subjective factors are also relevant: what was the reason for their being there, and what were their perceptions about being there? I agree with Lord Wilson (para 37) that "wishes", "views", "intentions" and "decisions" are not the right words, whether we are considering the habitual residence of a child or indeed an adult. It is better to think in terms of the reasons why a person is in a particular place and his or her perception of the situation while there &#8211; their state of mind. All of these factors feed into the essential question, which is whether the child has achieved a sufficient degree of integration into a social and family environment in the country in question for his or her residence there to be termed "habitual".</span></p>

It is the child's habitual residence which is in question. It is the child's integration which is under consideration. Each child is an individual with his own experiences and his own perceptions. These are not necessarily determined by the decisions of his parents, although sometimes these will leave him with no choice but to buckle down and get on with it. The tiny baby whose mother took him back to her home country in Mercredi v Chaffe was in a very different situation from any of the three children with whom we are concerned. The environment of an infant or very young child is (one hopes) a family environment and so determined by reference to the person with whom he lives. But once a child leaves the family environment and goes to school, his social world widens and there are more factors to be taken into account. Furthermore, where parents are separated, there may well be two possible homes in which the children can live and the children will be well aware of this. This may well affect the degree of their integration in a new environment.</span></p>

Some habitual residences may be harder to lose than others and others may be harder to gain. If a person leaves his home country with the intention of emigrating and having made all the necessary plans to do so, he may lose one habitual residence immediately and acquire a new one very quickly. If a person leaves his home country for a temporary purpose or in ambiguous circumstances, he may not lose his habitual residence there for some time, if at all, and correspondingly he will not acquire a new habitual residence until then or even later. Of course there are many permutations in between, where a person may lose one habitual residence without gaining another.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is impossible in a mere summary of the party&#8217;s positions on this issue, to do justice to the extensive written and oral submissions that I have received.  Though there is a consensus as to how the question of &#8216;habitual residence&#8217; should be approached, there is wide divergence as to the answer.  The Local Authority&#8217;s skeleton argument does not, as I read it, crystallise a position.  In oral submissions Ms Moore, appearing on the Local Authority&#8217;s behalf, suggested that SR may have been &#8216;habitually resident&#8217; in Morocco but later transferred that status to the UK.  It was not a submission deeply rooted in an analysis of either the facts or the law, Ms Moore deferred in that exercise to Mr Setright.  Nonetheless, as a general impression of SR&#8217;s habitual residence it is a potentially useful touchstone.  The Father contends that SR&#8217;s habitual residence is Morocco and has never altered.  The mother&#8217;s case is expressed as &#8216;neutral&#8217;, contemplating a variety of possibilities though ultimately, I think it is fair to say, weighted towards the conclusion that SR is habitually resident in the UK, probably having been so throughout her life.  The grandparents develop their secondary submission, i.e. habitual residence in the UK, in Mr Williams&#8217; skeleton argument.  There it is contended that SR was never habitually resident in Morocco or alternatively if she had been, at some point prior to her departure in March 2013, this had been displaced by the time of her retention in England. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before I turn to apply all this to what I again emphasise is an essentially factual exercise I must preface my analysis with an important caveat. In part for different reasons but ultimately to the same effect I found both the mother and father to be unreliable witnesses.  Both, I find, lacked candour in the witness box; both were, at times, plainly dishonest.  In the case of the mother there were gaps in her memory that I find that could only reasonably be explained by her being &#8216;overwhelmed&#8217; psychologically in the period she was attempting to recollect, in the way that the expert evidence had foreshadowed.  An illustration of this last point was that whilst she could remember registering SR&#8217;s birth in Casablanca, a journey of several hours from Chefchaouen, an attractive town in north west Morocco where the parents lived and where SR was born, she could not remember how she had made the journey nor with whom.  There was nothing significant or controversial in this piece of evidence.  The father told me, spontaneously, that he had travelled with the mother by a combination of a friend&#8217;s taxi service and by train. It was, however, a complete blank in the mother&#8217;s mind which alerted me to be cautious when evaluating her evidence.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was also struck by the extent to which both parents so readily veered away from any focus on SR&#8217;s life and circumstances i.e. the very objective of this inquiry.  The mother was overly analytical in response to straight forward questions, her language peppered by social work argot which is rarely illuminating from a parent.  The father presented as preoccupied with the mother, his relationship with her or their &#8216;love story&#8217;, as he put it.   His unsigned and undated statement (which I accept as having been confirmed in his evidence) also contains very little, if any insight into SR&#8217;s life, friendships, interests or indeed her personality.  In assessing SR&#8217;s integration into a social or family environment I am therefore left with a paucity of material.  As I will develop below, SR was, during the early months of her life, a very well travelled little girl.  Her mother describes her as having a &#8216;gypsy soul&#8217;, the professionals, I suspect, would characterise this more harshly as a somewhat chaotic existence. </p>

It is too easy, particularly where a child has changed countries regularly, to be deflected by concrete facts, such as where the child was born or by how long a child was in a particular place, as if that were somehow determinative.  Sometimes these aspects of the evidence can be misleading, as I sought to illustrate in <span style="font-weight:bold">MB v SB</span> [2014] EWHC 3719 (Fam).  &#8216;Integration&#8217; as a concept involves a fusion of both the factual and the emotional, it is where a child feels settled, secure, happy and where the focus of his interests and attachments lie.  It is not merely geographical, identifying habitual residence requires much greater nuance than that, drawing inferences from facts, the parents&#8217; conduct, the feelings a child communicates and what the child may say.  Lord Wilson encapsulated the point in Re <span style="font-weight:bold">LC</span> (supra) at para 37 emphasising that integration encompasses more than the &#8216;surface features&#8217; of a child&#8217;s life.  </p>

The purpose of the reference in Art 8 to &#8216;the time the court is seised&#8217; is to crystallise the moment in time at which jurisdiction is to be determined in respect of a particular set of proceedings. The phrase &#8216;the courts&#8217; and &#8216;the court&#8217; in Art 8 must refer to the same court and they refer to a court that becomes seised of a case; if the child is habitually resident in that Member State then its courts will have jurisdiction under Art 8. The wording in Arts 9 and 10 of BIIR (&#8216;retain jurisdiction during a three-month period&#8217; and &#8216;shall retain jurisdiction&#8217;) readily contemplates the courts of the State of former habitual residence (Art 9), or habitual residence immediately prior to abduction (Art 10), having jurisdiction irrespective of whether there are any extant proceedings before those courts. Such an interpretation sits easily with recital 12: &#8216;the jurisdiction should lie in the first place with the Member State of the child&#8217;s habitual residence&#8217;.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am extremely conscious that some of the dates recorded in the papers cannot be accurate. There are, as I have suggested, a variety of reasons for this.  However, I predicate my analysis of the history on those dates which can be established to be reliable.  SR was born in Morocco on the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2010.  It is clear that both parents had intended that she be born in the UK: they agreed on this in their oral evidence.  I consider the impetus for this plan came from the mother.  Though she is an American citizen the mother has an ambivalent relationship with her own country.  There is no doubt that she regards herself as having had an unhappy childhood.  Her parents divorce clearly affected her greatly.  There are allegations of violence in LV&#8217;s first marriage.  It is perhaps these unhappy memories that colour her relationship with the USA.  It is also clear that the mother&#8217;s relationship with her own mother, who lives in New York, remains an uneasy one.  The mother told me that SR arrived before her due date.  Indeed, the mother can specifically record being in the process of trying to book a flight to London for herself, whilst heavily pregnant, when her waters broke.  The father recalled exactly the same detail in his own evidence, though he had not been with the mother at the time.  The mother&#8217;s connections with England are deep-seated. She was educated here to post-graduate level at highly respected universities.  She won an internship with the BBC.  She presents in evidence as a highly articulate and intelligent woman.   She evidently flourished at College. I suspect that her success there did something to boost her self confidence and at least effect some repair to the damage of her childhood.  Fragile though they may be, she put down roots in England in this period and there, in my assessment of her evidence, they remain.</p>

This, to my mind, is why she wished her daughter to be born here and to gain entitlement to British citizenship.  By contrast, during her time in Morocco the mother learnt next to no Arabic and did not improve her &#8216;risible&#8217; French (her phrase).  I have no sense of her integrating into life in Morocco at all, indeed she appears to have spent much of her time on social media on the internet.  This I find was also a source of conflict in the parent&#8217;s relationship and something the father took great objection to for both personal and cultural reasons.  He told me that he did not like the mother communicating with other men.  This plainly applied to all conversations however innocuous and superficial they might be.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In August 2010, the parents travelled to Casablanca together to register SR&#8217;s birth with the US Consulate.  I have already noted above that the mother&#8217;s recollection of this is largely blank and made my observations as to why.  Within a few weeks of this the parents had decided that the child should travel to England.  I have no doubt that this was intended by way of a &#8216;Plan B&#8217; to their original objective that SR should be born in the UK.  On the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September the mother, with a male purporting to be the father, registered the child&#8217;s birth in England claiming, fraudulently, that the child had been born in Kent.  The father, in evidence denied any complicity with this enterprise but I found his denials hollow and unconvincing.  He proffered no explanation as to why the mother should have taken SR, still only three months old, to England for such a short trip.   I have no doubt that this deception was the primary, if not the sole, object of the visit.  Shortly after the task was completed the mother returned to Morocco.  She remained for under two months before departing once again, this time, to France and then on to Switzerland.  I pause there to remind myself that by this stage SR was still only six months of age.  In August 2011 the mother and child travelled briefly to London before then going on to Istanbul and returning back to London.  Very quickly after their return mother and child travelled to California and then to New York, it would seem to visit the grandmother.  The mother became distressed when describing her visit to her own mother.  It was clear that she had built up in her mind some sense of &#8216;going home&#8217; as she told me.  It became very clear to her, quickly, that this was illusory. Whatever emotional support she thought that she might derive from her own mother was plainly not available to her.  She told me in evidence that she felt that for the time being there was no option open to her or SR other than a return to Morocco. On an intellectual level the mother, I believe, would wish for SR to have some real relationship with her father.  This resolve is, in part, powered by her sense that such opportunity was denied to her during the course of her own childhood.  However, the gulf between her capacity to understand the importance of such a relationship for her daughter and the reality of knowing how to achieve it is a wide one for this mother to bridge.  </p>

Superficially that might appear attractive, if I could identify any sense of either SR or her mother being settled or integrated in any way into the life of or the community in Chefchaouen.  During this period the grandmother LV visited.  She plainly regarded the parents relationship as being in trouble.  I have to say that this period, though crucial to the father&#8217;s claim that it established habitual residence in Morocco, still remains obscure.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am bound to say that I gained very little more information from his evidence which like his statement returned repeatedly to his relationship with the mother.  Though I permitted the advocates a good deal of latitude both in chief and in cross examination they did not extract from the father any significant evidence of SR&#8217;s routines, relationships, interest or pastimes.  I rather suspect that this was because the father was frequently absent either due to his work commitments or in consequence of the parents rather dysfunctional and unhappy relationship.  Though I cannot be clear about the dates involved it seems to be common ground that the relationship was punctuated by significant periods of separation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not make any cultural assumptions about the role that the father thought he should play in the care and upbringing of his daughter at this age. Too often such assumptions prove entirely misplaced. Families of whatever culture are infinitely variable.  That said, it is clear that the father had very &#8216;traditional&#8217; views about the role of women generally and on how they should behave publicly.  Beyond superficial generalisations the father conveyed no sense of the depth of his relationship with his daughter, nor did he open any window on to her life.  When I consider this alongside his subsequent disengagement, in recent months, with the Skype contact to his daughter and his failure to make any contact with the social services by way of explanation, I am left with a clear impression that Mr R&#8217;s commitment to his daughter has at best been inconsistent.  I have been told that SR enjoyed the Skype contact.  After such a chaotic early life, leading to her placement in foster care, it must have been reassuring for her to see a familiar face and to know that she had a father who cared for her.  His sudden and unexplained disappearance from her life will undoubtedly have confused her.  The father showed absolutely no insight into this obvious fact.  His inability to create a picture of SR&#8217;s life in Morocco I find is likely due to his playing an inconsistent part in it.  The statement filed by him, to which I have already referred, offers very few clues on these important issues nor did it provide much of a forensic foothold for Mr Feehan to explore from.  Mr Feehan points to the father&#8217;s assertions in the viability assessment:</p>

For the avoidance of doubt, I make no criticism of the father's solicitors in the preparation of his statement.  It seems to me that they did the best they could given their client&#8217;s failure to confirm the draft document or indeed respond to them at all in the 20 days before this hearing.  This of itself further confirms my impression of the father&#8217;s inconsistency towards his daughter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is common ground that for significant periods of time when the mother was in Morocco the parties were living apart.  The mother contends that the father was violent to her throughout the relationship.  Mr Setright put those allegations, in each particular, to the father during cross examination.  Each was denied, however I could immediately sense the father&#8217;s agitation when asked about the mother&#8217;s use of the internet which she had described as the catalyst for his violence.  I note also that in the father&#8217;s statement he describes the separation (when SR was only five months old) as having been provoked by the mother talking to a man via Skype.  In his own words the father states that he was &#8216;not happy&#8217;, &#8216;it showed no respect for me or our culture&#8217;. In addition, making due allowance for the inherent difficulties in translation, I found the father&#8217;s denials of the allegations of violence to be flat and unconvincing.  Without resolving the conflicting evidence around the occasion when the police were called, in Morocco, both parents agreed that they were called and that it was in the context of a domestic dispute.  By contrast, in her account of the domestic violence, I found the mother to be entirely credible, not least because in recounting the allegations she appeared to regard them as shameful and belittling to herself.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In November 2011 when she returned to Morocco SR was sixteen months old.  By the time she left, for the last time, arriving in London on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2013 (her passport was stamped at Heathrow airport) she was approaching 3 years old.  It is, I think, possible for a child in this age span to attain an habitual residence different to that of her primary carer but the circumstances in which this may potentially occur are likely to reveal clear and obvious signs of the child&#8217;s integration.  For my part, it seems common sense to say that if a child&#8217;s habitual residence, at this age, diverges from her mother&#8217;s (or primary carer&#8217;s) it is likely that there will be some alternative, strong attachment.  I have no sense of this with the father and I have heard no other individual mentioned be that adult or child.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s evidence of this period offers little by way of illumination either.  It is important to emphasise that Mr Setright, on her behalf, does not press vigorously for any particular outcome.  As one would expect, that entirely reflects the mother&#8217;s evidence.  She does not seek to diminish the father&#8217;s relationship with his daughter, she has no investment in that.  Rather, I think she would, in a somewhat idealised or sentimental manner, wish to portray the relationship in its most positive light as she would wish it to be.  Again however, she offers no colour or detail in respect of SR&#8217;s daily life in Morocco.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied that it is likely that the mother did not always cope well with day to day life in Morocco.  I consider it probable that she was, for the reasons already discussed above, at times overwhelmed.  It is also the case that the mother was physically incapacitated for six months in consequence of a broken leg.  She was, I find, the victim of domestic violence.  There were protracted periods of parental separation.  It is obvious that the mother was unhappy.  She had returned to Morocco, as she explained, with reluctance having exhausted her options and to some extent her energy.  Her return was, I find, nothing more than a quest for temporary harbour.  For all her difficulties this mother is a fiercely independent minded young woman.  It is difficult to see how the circumstances she describes in Morocco were ever going to be  conducive to her settling there.  This unhappiness must, inevitably, have communicated itself to SR and, even at her tender age, adversely impacted on her own capacity to settle.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already observed that I find neither mother nor father to be reliable chroniclers of the truth.  That, in part, explains why pieces of the evidence are contradictory.  More than that, contradictory feelings are intrinsic to the human condition particularly in times of stress or unhappiness.  Added to this in the mother&#8217;s case are mental health issues.  Ultimately, the court can only evaluate the witnesses and the key points of the evidence against the established framework of the law.  In <span style="font-weight:bold">A v A</span> (supra) Baroness Hale emphasised that the test derived from <span style="font-weight:bold">R v Barnet London Borough Council, Ex p Nilish Shah</span> [1983] 2 AC 309  should be abandoned when determining the habitual residence of a child: thus the &#8216;purposes&#8217; and &#8216;intentions&#8217; of the parents are one of a range of relevant factors and not determinative.  The Supreme Court identified the social and family environment of an infant or young child as being shared with those (whether parents or others) on whom the child is <span style="font-weight:bold">dependant</span> (my emphasis).  Logically therefore, as Baroness Hale emphasised, it is necessary to assess the integration of that person (i.e. on whom the child is dependant) in the social environment of the country concerned.  Here I am quite satisfied that, despite her sometimes disillusioned statements to the contrary, this mother has only really, for much of her adult life, integrated into the UK.   It is to the United Kingdom that she has regularly returned.  To achieve British citizenship for her daughter she was prepared to jeopardise her own good character.  SR&#8217;s sense of well being, her security whilst an infant in Morocco, was inevitably and inextricably linked to her mother.  For most of the time SR&#8217;s mother has been her entire social and family environment; as such I find that her own habitual residence is and has been throughout her life, like that of her mother, the United Kingdom.  </p>
