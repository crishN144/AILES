	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The proceedings began conventionally in 2019 with a petition for divorce, upon which decree nisi was granted in March 2020. Subsequently it transpired that at the date of the parties&#8217; marriage W was married to another man. This led to an application by H to rescind the decree, expert evidence from the country where W&#8217;s first marriage had taken place, separate litigation in that country; and ultimately, in June 2022, an agreement that W would not defend H&#8217;s application for a nullity order. In the meantime the financial remedy proceedings suffered a considerable amount of delay. </p>

	      </authorialNote>) functionally illiterate. For the majority of his adult life, therefore, he has had to rely on others to support him with many aspects of day to day life which most people take for granted. It is not disputed that for the duration of the parties&#8217; cohabiting relationship it was W who undertook that role. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">W&#8217;s application for a financial remedy order was issued in November 2019. It became apparent during the course of this hearing that because the focus of the parties for much of the past three years had been on the complex and hotly-contested matrimonial proceedings, most of the preparation for this hearing had been shoehorned into the window between the hearing on 9.6.22, when those proceedings were compromised, and this hearing in late September. H&#8217;s side of the case was particularly difficult to prepare in such a limited timeframe because of the challenges he faces in getting to grips with the issues without being able to read any of the documentation for himself. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The hearing was listed with a time estimate of three days. On the morning of the third day, when I was expecting to hear submissions, the parties informed me that H&#8217;s legal team had discovered, on reviewing some of W&#8217;s bank statements, that there was a significant discrepancy between what those statements purported to show and W&#8217;s written and oral evidence. After hearing submissions I determined that notwithstanding the fact that this discrepancy could and should have been spotted by H&#8217;s legal advisors well before the hearing, fairness demanded that the evidence be re-opened and the issue in question explored. H&#8217;s vulnerabilities, and the fact that he would not have been able to spot the discrepancy himself, played a significant part in that decision. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">From one perspective this case could be described, and has been by W, as a straightforward &#8220;needs&#8221; case. The identified capital assets are relatively modest, totalling something in the region of &#163;1.46m. Those funds will inevitably be required to re-house both parties. </p>

In other words, there is little to choose between them in terms of need. So this ought to be a case, all else being equal, where the &#8220;needs&#8221; and &#8220;sharing&#8221; principles are aligned and point unerringly towards an equal division of capital and a clean break. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">H disagrees. His case is that throughout the relationship W was leading what he describes as a &#8220;double life&#8221;. He believes that, having knowingly entered into a bigamous marriage with him, W conceived a plan to defraud him and ultimately to leave him, having enriched herself at his expense. In addition to making allegations of sexual infidelity, which do not directly concern this court (I record for completeness that W makes similar allegations against him), H says that throughout the marriage W was siphoning off joint funds and using them to accrue assets that he knew nothing about. He says that his illiteracy permitted W to act in this way, and that she exploited his vulnerability in this regard. </p>

In her Form E she alleged that H had perpetrated emotional abuse towards her during the marriage, although she is not running a &#8220;conduct&#8221; case within these proceedings. She says that because of H&#8217;s behaviour towards her, in particular during a period when she was unwell abroad in 2008/2009, she considered the marriage to be over many years before the separation. She accepts that from time to time during the parties&#8217; relationship she undertook financial transactions which she did not inform H about, but says that this was because the parties managed their finances independently, and that H also engaged in financial ventures without informing her (although she does not specify what these were). </p>

In fact, because she agrees that the parties should each retain their business assets and she should bear some of her own debt, her proposal results in a 55%:45% division of the assets in H&#8217;s favour. On her figures she would leave the marriage with &#163;663,920 and H with &#163;795,330. </p>

I am conscious that the factual background to this is highly contentious, and that no findings have been made because the matter was compromised. What does not seem to be disputed is that W&#8217;s marriage took place when she was just 16, after she had been made pregnant by a man significantly older than her. She separated from her husband after just over a year of marriage, when she and her family moved to the UK. The marriage was annulled in [country B] in 2021. </p>

In particular, the court should consider whether the lie was deliberate (ie it did not arise from confusion or mistake); whether it related to a significant issue; and whether there is anything else, for example shame, misplaced loyalty, fear or distress, which could explain the lie: <span style="font-style:italic">R v Lucas</span> [1981] QB 720; <span style="font-style:italic">Re A, B and C (Children)</span> [2021] EWCA Civ 451.</p>

The following summary is taken from the FLR headnote:</p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;Conduct is relevant in financial remedy cases in four distinct situations. First there is gross and obvious meted out by one party against the other. This will only be taken into account in very rare circumstances and will only be reflected where there is a financial consequence to its impact. This can extent to economic misconduct. If one party economically oppresses the other for selfish or malicious reasons then, provided the high standard of &#8216;inequitable to disregard&#8217; is met, it may be reflected in the substantive award. Secondly, there is the &#8216;add-back&#8217; jurisprudence, which arises where one party has wantonly and recklessly dissipated assets which would otherwise have formed part of the divisible matrimonial property. Thirdly, there is litigation misconduct. Where proved, this should be severely penalised in costs, although it is very difficult to conceive of any circumstances where litigation misconduct should affect the substantive division. Fourthly, there is the evidential technique of drawing inferences as to the existence of assets from a party&#8217;s conduct in failing to give full and frank disclosure. The taking account of such conduct was part of the process of computation rather than distribution. Normally the court would be able to make the necessary assessment of the approximate scale of the non-visible assets.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Logically, those four species of conduct will usually not be taken in that order. In most cases it will be necessary to determine allegations of non-visible assets and add-back arguments first, as part of the process of computation of the assets. The consideration of whether there is &#8220;gross and obvious&#8221; conduct which it would be inequitable for the court to disregard will then follow as part of the s 25 discretionary exercise (at which point the court will also need to have regard, if there has been an add-back, to the fact that the assets added back are no longer available to meet needs). Any litigation conduct will be taken into account at the end of the process, when determining issues of costs. </p>

He viewed the parties&#8217; financial resources, in particular, as fully mingled: while he knew that W had her own earnings just as he had his, he assumed that she was managing their joint assets for the benefit of both of them and trusted her entirely to do so.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In reviewing the relevant transactions it has been important to keep in mind the impact that H&#8217;s illiteracy had on his ability to keep himself appraised of the detail of the parties&#8217; finances. It would be easy to underestimate the challenges faced by someone in H&#8217;s position, challenges which became increasingly apparent over the course of H&#8217;s oral evidence. H&#8217;s illiteracy placed, in my judgement, a significant burden of trust on W. Even if W is right to say that from 2009 onwards she started emotionally to disengage from the marriage and no longer viewed herself and H as a couple, she does not dispute that H continued to trust her to act on his behalf on financial issues, and to manage both the jointly-held assets and also some resources in his sole name. Mr Lewis pointed out, rightly in my view, that if W did view herself as separated, that only increased the duty on her to deal fairly with all the parties&#8217; finances, and to ensure that the dominant position she held as a result of H&#8217;s illiteracy was not exploited. </p>

It is possible to imagine circumstances in which one spouse might quite legitimately conduct a transaction of this nature without any reference to the other. Within a marriage a couple may operate entirely independently in financial terms. There are plenty of relationships in which one party, by agreement, looks after all of the finances on behalf of the couple and the other is content not to be kept informed. Where the assets are very substantial (not the case here) it may be more likely that the purchase and sale of a single property will take place without any discussion between the spouses about it. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">A curious feature of the evidence on this issue is that many of the emails sent to the conveyancers over the relevant period were sent from H&#8217;s email account. H&#8217;s case is that he found out about the attempted sale after the parties separated, when he asked his son-in-law to help him read through &#8220;his&#8221; emails. W accepts that she sent the emails from H&#8217;s account, although she says that she did so on his behalf and with his knowledge. </p>

Over the period from August 2014 to February 2015 two successive offers were accepted on the property and conveyancing solicitors were instructed to progress the sale. Each fell through after the sale stalled due to delays on the seller&#8217;s side. The emails show increasingly strenuous attempts by the conveyancer to obtain the KYC documentation from H in order to progress the sale. They include a particularly telling exchange where the conveyancer explains that the buyer is threatening to pull out and in response W gives one excuse after another for the delay, including the fact that H has been travelling in Ireland, and then tells the conveyancers that the documentation is in the post. </p>

It has not been possible during this hearing to making precise findings beyond those set out above. However in my view it is more likely than not that the findings I have made on H&#8217;s sample allegations do not represent the entirety of the funds which W has removed over the years, and that the sum of the parties&#8217; assets is less now than it would have been if W had not acted in the way she did. </p>

After the hearing the current tenancy agreement was located and it was established that the current lease is due to end in December 2022.

However he has considerable experience in handling property sales and rental agreements in the development where the parties&#8217; property is located, and it seems unlikely to me that he would be wrong about this issue, which must arise very frequently. I also consider, without wishing to stray too far into the realms of Dubai housing law, that there is some support for Mr E&#8217;s view in the terms of the tenancy agreement itself, which makes it clear that the termination of the lease is dependent on notice being given as required by Dubai law. </p>

I have found that at least &#163;100,000 is missing from the rental payments that were received over the period from 2012, when the property was first let, until 2019. It is necessary now to determine whether those funds remain available to W.</p>

This increases the likelihood that over that period some of the funds were spent; as does the fact that the majority of the funds appear to have passed through the hands of W&#8217;s sister. I have rejected W&#8217;s evidence that H and W agreed to allow W&#8217;s sister to have the use of the funds, but that does not necessarily mean that they remain intact and available to W. </p>

H had trusted W to manage the Dubai property in such a way as would preserve the rental income for their joint future; she not only failed to do that, but knowingly deceived H, with the result that it was not until after these proceedings had commenced that he discovered that the funds he had relied on to support his retirement had gone. </p>

In the longer term, if not on a day to day basis, W&#8217;s conduct has had a substantial adverse effect on H&#8217;s ability to access and use his own money. The most obvious example is the Dubai rent, which H believed for many years to be accumulating in a joint account as a retirement fund. I appreciate that there are some forms of economic abuse, for example those that involve the coercive restriction of the other party&#8217;s day-to-day expenditure, that may be more familiar, and therefore more easily recognised as abusive. However W&#8217;s conduct in this case involved the exploitation of a dominant position, which is the essence of all forms of abusive behaviour; and the fact that H was unaware of W&#8217;s behaviour at the time, and that it did not directly impact on his daily life during the marriage, has only made his subsequent discovery of it more shocking. I am in no doubt that H feels a profound sense of betrayal, and that the harm caused by W&#8217;s actions has extended well beyond the financial detriment they have caused. </p>

In concluding that this one does, I draw on my range of experience of the behaviours exhibited by spouses towards each other, within their financial relationships and otherwise. In my view the features which take this case out of the ordinary include H&#8217;s illiteracy and W&#8217;s exploitation of his consequent vulnerability; the deliberate nature of the deception perpetrated by W; and the fact that the behaviour was sustained over a considerable time period. </p>

However my findings about W&#8217;s conduct go well beyond these two particular instances of it. I have made a general finding of similar behaviour on W&#8217;s part over many years that is likely to have depleted the family assets, although it is not possible to quantify the extent of the depletion. </p>

In the present case, I bear in mind that although the underlying issues at the final hearing concerned W&#8217;s dishonesty, the reason why that hearing went part-heard, disrupting the court timetable and increasing costs, was the late identification of relevant documents by H&#8217;s legal team.

I do not know exactly how much of that was incurred after 9.6.22 but consider that I can safely assume that W&#8217;s 75% contribution, after assessment, will not exceed &#163;40,000 and may well be considerably less. There is unlikely to be any significant impact on W&#8217;s ability to meet her needs, for the reasons I have given elsewhere in this judgment.  </p>
