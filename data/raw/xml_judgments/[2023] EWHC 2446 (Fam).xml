	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background to the case is highly contentious private family law proceedings concerning a child under the age of 5, who I will call XX.  For reasons that will become apparent below, the facts of the case and any personal information about the parties are irrelevant to Ms Tickle&#8217;s application and this judgment, save in the broadest terms. The Father told me that there have been proceedings since 2019 and there are allegations of domestic abuse and &#8220;parental alienation&#8221; in the factual mix.  A final order was made in, I believe, 2021 and the current proceedings concern an enforcement application by the Father. In brief overview therefore, it is a not unusual example of the kind of intractable dispute that takes place in the Family Court. </p>

The Judge adjourned Ms Tickle&#8217;s application in the order of 22 August 2023 for reasons given orally. Ms Tickle sought permission to appeal from the Judge. This application was also refused, with further written reasons, by way of an order dated 25 August 2023</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have an agreed and approved note of the hearing on 22 August but not of the first day, 21 August 2023. This is because Ms Tickle was not present on the first day and it formed no part of her original Grounds of Appeal. However, Dr Proudman in her Skeleton Argument in support of the appeal made reference to various things that were said on the first day, which had been reported to her by her client.  The Father disputed the accuracy of some of that report. I note that Dr Proudman was not present at that hearing. I took the view that it was not appropriate to consider any submissions which turned on what happened on 21 August without having a transcript approved by the Judge. I therefore told Mr Barnes that if he wished to pursue his Amended Grounds, I would have to adjourn the appeal, and that would necessarily involve adjourning it until after the substantive hearing in the case, which is listed for 4 days commencing on 17 October before a different Circuit Judge. In those circumstances Mr Barnes elected not to pursue his application to amend. I did however order a transcript to be produced of 21 August given the serious points that were raised by Dr Proudman&#8217;s Skeleton Argument. </p>

There was no evidence heard at the hearing of 21 and 22 August 2023. Therefore, the focus of Ms Tickle&#8217;s application was not the substantive issues (and evidence) in the case, but rather the procedural and systemic issues that had emerged from hearing.  </p>

Having a report of this case, limited to just the things that have happened over the last two days would be on any view incomplete. It would lack context and carry a significant risk of being misleading. We are, as Miss Tickle rightly says, looking at very, very important issues. We're looking at courts, the problems that people have with funding these cases.  We are looking at how litigants in person cope with this challenging process.</span></p>

We're looking at the most complex of family circumstances where, as we know, this case involves two outcomes, including one possibility of finding parental alienation, which is a terrible place to find yourself with a family. Or alternatively, we're looking at the loss to a small little [child] of one important parental figure possibly for the whole of [their] childhood. And whilst I'm not going to foreshadow what ultimately my decision will be, together with I'm sure another application to report everything else that's happened.</span></p>

I don&#8217;t want anyone to think that this decision foreshadows what the outcome of that will be; it will be determined on its merits at the time. Okay.&#8221;</span></p>

It is a familiar expression nowadays in family law, not least because of the central role it plays, for example, in Article 8 of the European Convention and the wider Strasbourg jurisprudence. If elaboration is required, what precisely does it mean?

The general rule is that proceedings are held in public and what is said, including the names of the parties and witnesses, can be observed and reported. In a case which involves the "determination" of criminal liability or civil rights and obligations, Article 6 confers on each party to litigation the right to a public hearing and a public judgment. Publicity for what goes on in court may be embarrassing and painful for those involved and third parties who are indirectly and incidentally affected but in general, "the collateral impact that this process has on those affected is part of the price to be paid for open justice and the freedom of the press to report fairly and accurately on judicial proceedings held in public": Khuja v Times Newspapers Ltd <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2017/49" uk:canonical="[2017] UKSC 49" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] UKSC 49</ref>, [2019] AC [34(2)].</span></p>

The category of exception that is relevant here is the need to protect private and family life rights, including in particular the rights of children. This was to the fore in Re S, where a mother was charged with the murder of one of her children. S, aged 5, was the brother of the deceased. The Guardian of S, concerned that reporting of the criminal trial would be seriously detrimental to S's welfare, sought an order for the mother and both children to be anonymised in any such reporting. The application was ultimately refused by the High Court, and appeals were dismissed by this Court and the House of Lords. </span></p>

In a case where the child was not a party or witness and the interference with his Article 8 rights was indirect there was no justification for creating any new category of exception to the normal rule of open justice or otherwise interfering with free reporting of the trial. At [17], Lord Steyn famously identified four key propositions as to how the court should address a conflict between Articles 8 and 10. The passage is very familiar, but because it is so important to the present appeal we cite it:</span></p>

There, the House explored the interplay between Articles 8 and 10 in the context of a complaint about press disclosure of the claimant's drug taking and rehabilitation. In the course of so doing, the House affirmed a principle of relevance to the present case. The claimant had falsely denied taking drugs. As Lord Hope put it at [82], "where a public figure chooses to make untrue pronouncements about his or her private life, the press will normally be entitled to put the record straight". (See also, to similar effect, Lord Hoffmann at [58] and Baroness Hale at [151]: "The press must be free to expose the truth and put the record straight"). The reporters rely on this principle as providing a public interest justification for the disclosure of at least parts of the judgment of HHJ Williscroft. </span></p>

Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.&#8217; This is usually shortened to the pithier &#8216;sunlight is the greatest disinfectant&#8217;. Where court proceedings are concerned, he was without doubt correct. Open justice may not often be thought of as one of the most important principles that underpins fair trials and the proper administration of justice. The focus is on the right to due notice, to an adversarial process, and equality of arms. It is on the right to submit and test evidence and to participate effectively in proceedings. But the ultimate guarantee of all these principles is open justice. Without it they would not last long as meaningful principles. Nor would our courts and judiciaries maintain public confidence and legitimacy. Open justice is a necessary foundation of the rule of law. That is why we should all give very careful thought in the years to come, as technology continues to reshape our justice systems, to maintaining and, more importantly, enhancing how we give effect to open justice.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fourthly, it will rarely, but not never, be appropriate for the Court to inquire as to why the journalist is seeking to report, or how s/he became aware of the hearing. In general, as Mr Barnes submits, this will be a matter for the journalist who would not be expected to reveal a &#8220;source&#8221;. However, if the Judge becomes concerned that one party is seeking to use reporting as a litigation strategy, particularly in the context of issues around coercive control, the Judge may wish to inquire into the background to the application to report. This can only be considered on a case specific basis. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fifthly, in determining whether a reporter can report on what they see and hear in a Family Court, the Judge will have to apply a balance between Article 8 and Article 10. The approach to such a balancing exercise was considered in detail by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Griffiths v Tickle</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2021/1882" uk:canonical="[2021] EWCA Civ 1882" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWCA Civ 1882</ref> at [27]-[40]. The Court will have to apply an <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;intense focus&#8221;</span> on the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case &#8230;&#8221;, </span>see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Griffiths</span> [37] and Lord Steyn in the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re S</span> at [17].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Sixthly, the child&#8217;s best interest will be critical, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Griffiths</span> at [71], although they will still have to be balanced against the other rights asserted. In practice, in most cases in the Family Court, it will be of great importance to preserve the anonymity of the child, so far as is reasonably practicable. I note this caveat because there will be cases, such as <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Griffiths</span> itself or cases concerning a high profile criminal case, where anonymity can only be preserved in reality to a certain degree. There may be an important distinction between cases such as the present, where the reporter is seeking to report wholly generic and systemic matters, and where the reporting is of the facts and evidence in the case, where the risk of identification of the child is much greater. The experience of the Transparency Pilot currently under way is that anonymity of the child can be effectively preserved by the use of a detailed Transparency Order. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Seventhly, there is a public interest in the reporting of cases in the Family Courts. This is made clear in the report of the President of the Family Division (Sir Andrew McFarlane) in his report <span style="font-style:italic">Confidence and Confidentiality: Transparency in the Family Courts</span> (21 October 2021). At paragraph 22 the President said:</p>

I have, therefore, reached the clear conclusion that there needs to be a major shift in culture and process to increase the transparency of the system in a number of respects. In short, the reasons for this conclusion are as follows: &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Report goes on to refer to the genuine and legitimate public interest in the Family Justice System for the purposes of gaining public confidence in the system, and greater knowledge and understanding of issues such as domestic abuse, see [30]. In my view it is relevant that because most Family Court cases are held in private and with no reporting, there is less knowledge or understanding of the challenges facing the Family Justice System than those facing the Criminal Justice System. There is a very real public interest in there being greater understanding of the work done by the Family Courts. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Eighthly, there may well be cases where it is appropriate to adjourn a decision about whether a case can be reported on until the final hearing. However, whether that is justified must be considered on the facts of the individual case. Adjourning the decision is itself an interference with the reporter&#8217;s Article 10 rights, and as such is different from a more normal case management decision. The Court must bear in mind that the resources of media outlets and reporters are finite, and a reporter may not be able to return on a future occasion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ninthly, in deciding whether to allow reporting, the views of the parties, including the child, are of great significance. However, they are not determinative, so no party holds a veto against reporting. As in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Griffiths</span> there will be cases where one party wants to be allowed to &#8220;tell their story&#8221;, and to prevent them doing so will be an interference, albeit potentially justified, in their Article 8 rights. There may therefore be cases where there are competing Article 8 rights which need to be considered. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Applying those principles to the facts of this case I conclude that the Judge erred in law. The decision to adjourn the reporting application was a case management decision and as such the Court should ordinarily be very slow to intervene, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re TG (Care Proceedings Case Management Expert Evidence) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 1 FLR 1250" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 1 FLR 1250</ref> at [24] to [38]. However, a decision on reporting is rather different from most case management decisions because it interferes with an Article 10 right and in practice may prevent that journalist from reporting at all. It therefore appears to me that the full rigour of the principles in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re TG</span> do not fully apply. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view, the Judge here did not apply the Article 8/10 balance in a legally appropriate manner. On the Article 8 side of the balance he did not address his mind to the fact that given the restrictions that Ms Tickle proposed, there was no possibility of the child or parents being identified. She did not seek to report any of the evidence and any of the factual matrix beyond the greatest of generalities. As such, it put the case well outside the norm of what is sought to be reported. The Judge in his consideration simply did not engage with the scope of the limitations Ms Tickle was proposing. As such, &#8220;confidentiality&#8221; or &#8220;anonymity&#8221; did not arise in any meaningful way on the facts of the case. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Judge&#8217;s justification for adjourning the application was the concern that reporting might jeopardise the fairness of the substantive hearing and therefore impact on the parties&#8217;, in particular the Father&#8217;s, Article 6 rights.  However, this approach does not stand up to scrutiny. Again, Ms Tickle was not seeking to report about the factual or evidential matrix of the case. Therefore the concern that her reporting might not give a fair view of the case misunderstood what she wished to report. In any event it is of the greatest importance to understand that it is not for the Court to consider the quality or fairness of the reporting. The Court is not an arbiter of the editorial content of reporting. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To the degree the Judge was concerned that the parents, or in particular the Father, might be upset or antagonised by reporting and that would impact on a fair trial, that approach comes very close to giving parents a veto over reporting, which plainly would not meet the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re S</span> requirement for an intense focus on the competing rights. In any event, there was minimal or no evidence to support such a position. The nature of the reporting would make it impossible to identify anyone and was not going to comment on the evidence. It is possible that Ms Tickle will refer to issues of parental alienation and domestic abuse, and the Father, who will know that the report concerns this case, may not agree with that. But that is hardly a ground to refuse to allow reporting. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the Article 10 side of the balance, the Judge did not consider the strong public interest, as explained by the President of the Family Division and set out above, in the public being informed about the working of the Family Justice System and the problems that are faced on a daily basis with private family law cases.  Again the Judge simply did not grapple with this part of the overall balance. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For these reasons I conclude that the Judge did not properly direct himself with regard to the Article 8/10 balance, essentially for the reasons set out in Mr Barnes&#8217; Grounds of Appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I then have to decide whether to remit the matter back to the Judge, or to the Judge who is not to hear the substantive matter, or to decide Ms Tickle&#8217;s application myself. In my view the most appropriate and proportionate approach is for this Court to determine the application. I have had all the material presented to me, and this is not a decision that either turns on primary evidence nor on a detailed knowledge of the underlying facts of the case. Further, it is important to deal with press applications in a proportionate manner, and that militates in favour of not having another hearing to decide the application.</p>

	  <num>60.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the reasons that I have set out above, I take the view that this is a case where the Article 8/10 balance, and taking into account any impacts on Article 6 rights, points clearly in favour of allowing report. In very brief summary, there is effectively no risk of the child being identified. There is a strong public interest in allowing Ms Tickle to report the generic concerns about the Family Justice System which arise. There is no interference in any parties&#8217; Article 6 rights. I will therefore allow the appeal and allow the application. </p>
