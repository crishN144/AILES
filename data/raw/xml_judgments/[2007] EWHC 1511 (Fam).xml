They were married in 1979, and have two children, both of whom are grown up and independent. Following the breakdown of the marriage divorce proceedings were commenced eleven years ago, in 1996. At one stage the proceedings were contested and there were cross petitions, but eventually the divorce was resolved and attention moved on to the ancillary relief proceedings.</span></p>

It specialised in providing software programmes to the banking industry. In 2001 MIS sold the assets of the business and the intellectual property rights to its software programmes to Thompson Financial Ltd (TFL). The date of completion of the sale was the 26</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Bookman Old Style'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Bookman Old Style'"> June 2001. MIS was thereafter to be wound up and dissolved, save for one holding company which was to be retained for pension purposes.</span></p>

The parties were to be represented by eminent members of the Family Bar specialising in &#8220;big money&#8221; cases; the wife by Nicholas Mostyn QC and Richard Scarratt, and the husband by Lewis Marks (now QC).</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Bookman Old Style'">The proceedings had been hard fought, and there was a degree of mistrust, particularly on the wife&#8217;s side, of the husband. An FDR hearing before Bennett J. had failed to achieve a settlement. In the days leading up to the final hearing various proposals and counter-proposals were made, and Mr Mostyn and Mr Marks had discussions to try and narrow the differences between them.</span></p>

A particular bone of contention between the parties concerned certain secondary consideration to which the husband might become entitled from TFL. This was contingent on him continuing to work for TFL and on the trading performance of the MIS product after the sale. The wife sought a share of this secondary consideration, and the husband was trying to resist it, his stance having, apparently, received some support from remarks made by Bennett J. at the FDR.</span></p>

Happily, I have not been burdened with the third issue, as it was resolved during the hearing.</span></p>

He said that it was as a result of that discussion that, at his request, Mr Marks asked for the proviso to be inserted into the agreement ensuring that if he did not get the money, neither would the wife. His recollection is, plainly, unreliable. It is not borne out by the sequence of the e-mails, and Mr Turner has not sought to rely upon it.

The wife believed that the husband had the prospect of receiving large sums by way of secondary consideration and would not leave TFL for that reason. It did not occur to her or her advisers that the husband might resign. Mr Mostyn said in cross-examination that he was aware that the husband could resign but he did not believe that he had any intention of doing so.

Such people have a tendency to suffer disappointment in their expectations. He is the sort of person who is quick to take offence and to get over excited. He admitted in evidence that this was part of his character, although he said that he normally calmed down again quite quickly. Surrendering the business that he had built up to a large conglomerate and becoming an employee was never going to be an easy transition for him to make. In addition, the commercial climate for the business changed suddenly and adversely shortly after the acquisition as a result of the tragic events in the United States on 9/11.

In my view it was the redundancy of his former staff, such as Miss Gyngell, and the way in which it was handled, which was the catalyst and final straw. It prompted him to resign without regard for the financial consequences for his wife or himself. He was giving up a secure salary of &#163;200,000 per annum and his share of the final tranche of the primary consideration, and had no job to go to.</span></p>

Other cheques issued at around the same time were presented and met, but only because the husband put &#163;100,000 from his own resources into the account. This enabled the cheques to be met.

The arbitrary unfairness of accepting that interpretation can be seen from the table set out above. Singer J. was told that the wife was to get 50% of the available assets. It was on that basis that he exercised his discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref>, approved the agreement, and made the order. It was not envisaged that the wife would be left with only 45% of the assets, and that is not an outcome which the judge was being invited to endorse.</span></p>

The agreement provided no mechanism to take account of future fluctuations in the exchange rate. By the time the first tranche became payable in June 2002, the rate had increased to US$1.57, so its value to him in sterling had reduced, yet the amount he was required to pay the wife remained unchanged.</span></p>

If one adopts a broader construction, though, and interprets the provision to apply to all debts for which either of them had personal liability at the date of the agreement which would have formed part of the shortfall but for the husband&#8217;s cash injection, the result is the same. This is because the main debt is the Revenue debt, of which I have held the husband had knowledge, and which should have been disclosed, and the residue relates to penalties and expenses incurred in the winding up after the date of the agreement for which there was no personal liability.</span></p>
