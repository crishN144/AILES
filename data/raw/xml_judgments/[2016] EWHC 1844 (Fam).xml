The mother and father contend that L was not habitually resident in England on that date, and that she was habitually resident in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Central Authority contends that L&#8217;s habitual residence was, and is, in Ukraine, and argues that L should in the circumstances be returned to Ukraine.  I have been assisted in resolving this dispute by counsel for all the key parties.  Additionally, Mr. Volodymyr Kovalenko, the Ukrainian Consul, has attended the hearings before me, and has offered (and given) material assistance to the Court.</p>

She is a graduate from the University of Kharkiv, having obtained there the equivalent of a BA in English.  She worked in Ukraine as an English teacher prior to the birth of L.  The father is from Leeds. The parents met via an internet dating site in 2013, and married in Ukraine later in that year. The father works in the IT industry, and derives other income from rental property.  During the parents&#8217; relationship and early marriage, the father was, it is agreed, a regular visitor to Ukraine (he spent overall about 14 weeks there in 2&#189; years).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In November 2015, the mother travelled to England with L.  Much attention was given at the hearing before me as to the intentions of the mother (and to a lesser extent the father) at the point at which the mother and child arrived here.  The mother&#8217;s 2014 visa application revealed that she intended to live with her &#8216;sponsor&#8217; (the father) &#8220;permanently&#8221;; although non-specific as to where she would live with him, by inference this would have been in England, as the father had business interests here, no business connections with Ukraine, and the balance of the information provided in the form otherwise suggested this.  She further declared that she intended &#8220;potentially&#8221; to &#8220;do some translation work&#8221; and/or teach English to Eastern European foreign students once legally able to do so.  She also indicated an intention to help her husband with a new business venture.  In her oral evidence to me, the mother said that she came to England &#8220;to try to live here, to see how it goes.  We did not have any exact plans; I was going to see if I liked it here&#8221;.  The father&#8217;s evidence was that the couple had no long-term plans either way; he believed that the maternal grandparents were contemplating that the mother and L would return to Ukraine.</p>

She describes the first argument taking place on the very day after her arrival, the father&#8217;s birthday.  On 31 January 2016, the mother wrote an e-mail to a pastor in Ukraine describing &#8220;problems&#8221; in the relationship with the father in the following terms:</p>

I have decided he can rent an apartment for us in Ukraine and we will leave him alone, as he wants, as he tells me all the time, I will get money or sell the house and get rid of you, and I will try to take the child from you through the court, but he will not take her, no matter how hard he tries. When I was pregnant he made my life a void, do you remember because of stress I nearly lost my child, he tormented me every day, he is very good at pretending, especially when he talks to the pastor and people from church. At home he is a real tyrant, immoral tyrant at that. He suffers from his stupidity&#8230; It is impossible to live with him. If he was working, it would be much easier, I would not see him all day long, he hasn&#8217;t worked for almost 3 months, I am bored and lonely with him, he does not take me anywhere, he used to, but very rarely, he never suggests going anywhere.

The NSPCC made a child protection referral to the local authority, who undertook a joint investigation; in the investigation, the mother denied shaking L, but reported emotional and physical abuse from the father, and said that she was scared of him. Both parents acknowledged that during a recent argument between them, L&#8217;s nose began to bleed because of her excessive and vigorous crying.  L was examined at hospital on 3 March, and no injuries were identified. She was described as a &#8220;happy healthy little girl with no concerning marks or injuries&#8230; No cause for concern&#8221;.  When asked for an account by the treating clinicians of what he had seen the mother do to L, the father gave a qualified version (&#8220;it was not ill-treatment, more an act of frustration&#8221;), and conceded that he may have exaggerated the original account to the NSPCC.  The mother denied shaking L, and denied being frustrated with her. The father has now almost completely retracted the allegation, and maintains that no incident occurred involving shaking of L.  The father says that he was motivated to make a false allegation by anger towards the mother. </p>

The Judge&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">provisional</span> view was that L was habitually resident in England as at 5 March 2016 (the date of the emergency protection order); counsel for the father expressed himself unsurprised by that indication. The judge was then clear in affording the advocates the opportunity to present the arguments fully if so instructed. They chose not to do so, and the jurisdiction issue was formally conceded by the lawyers on behalf of their clients; recitals to that effect appear on the order:</p>

He declined to do so, and gave a short judgement in which he set out the reasons for his earlier expressed provisional view.

As (a) the judge had only ever offered a provisional view (the judgment of 25 May had done no more than to explain that view), and (b) the concession had been offered at a time when the mother was not assisted at court by an interpreter (and was therefore inherently vulnerable to challenge), I offered to re-consider &#8211; or perhaps more accurately substantively consider for the first time &#8211; the habitual residence issue.  This had the advantage of avoiding the delays involved in any possible appeal, particularly given that, if successful, there was a real prospect that the Court of Appeal would simply remit the case for (re-)hearing.  All parties (the local authority reluctantly) accepted that this would be the most pragmatic course, achieving a swifter result in a more proportionate way, and affording an opportunity to me to examine the facts carefully.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">L spent the first 13 months of her life in Ukraine with her mother, and prior to November 2015 her habitual residence was unquestionably in Ukraine.  The child and the mother&#8217;s integration in Ukraine in that period ran deep; it was the country of their nationality, it was their home, where they were surrounded by family, where the mother had been raised and educated, where the mother had friends.  The essential question is whether that changed in the weeks after their arrival in the UK.   So all-encompassing and profound was the extent of the mother&#8217;s integration in Ukraine that a shift or tilt (reference Lord Wilson&#8217;s &#8216;see-saw&#8217; at [23(vi)] above) of habitual residence would not be likely to happen quickly; this was particularly so given that the maternal grandparents, maternal aunt and cousin, with whom L and her mother had lived prior to travelling here, remained in Ukraine, and all remained in daily contact &#8211; thus preserving a strong &#8220;continuing link with the old state&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span> at [46(c)]).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s intentions on her arrival in this country are among the relevant factors, but they are by no means decisive.  There is evidence that in 2014 (i.e. a year or more before her travels), the mother had formed a reasonably firm intention to travel to England permanently.  In her written evidence before the court, she stated that before she came to England she believed that L would have a &#8220;better life&#8221; here, and she wanted to create a &#8220;good family&#8221; with the father.  The mother told me in oral evidence that she further wished to escape the crisis in Ukraine.  However, by the time she actually arrived in this country, in my judgment, her views had modified somewhat (see [6] above).  She had a more open mind about whether this would be either a positive or indeed a permanent move.  I find that the optimistic views about life in England which she held when she had completed her visa application some 18 months before travelling, had given way to considerable doubts.  This was largely attributable, in my view, to the fact that in the months which had followed the submission of the paperwork the father had &#8220;made [her] life a void, &#8230; he tormented me every day&#8221; (see email of February 2016 at [10] above); by the time of her journey here, she was prepared merely to &#8220;see how it goes&#8221; (see [6] above).  Her visit had no true sense of permanence about it.</p>

The mother&#8217;s first witness statement is consistent with these e-mails, and is corroborated in some degree by the social work evidence.  The note on the mantelpiece (see [11] above) is unlikely to have been contrived to paint a misleading picture for the investigating authorities, and also, therefore, indicates the true state of affairs in the relevant period &#8211; a young mother struggling in the face of hostility from her partner.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within a short time of her arrival in the UK in November 2015, I find that the mother&#8217;s fading optimism about life here all but evaporated altogether.  The parental relationship, which had shown earlier signs of being an abusive one quickly became actually so; I am satisfied that from an early point after her arrival in the UK the mother became deeply unhappy, and felt (and indeed actually was) isolated.  The father is significantly older than the mother; their relationship had been forged by web-based dating, and there are no obvious signs that they shared much in common culturally, linguistically, or socially.  On Judge Pemberton&#8217;s interim findings, the father controlled her.  It seems to me that he effectively quarantined the mother in his own home.  The relationship was volatile; it was characterised by a &#8220;very high level of acrimony&#8221; which was &#8220;stressful&#8221; for the mother.  The mother complained of the father humiliating and dominating her (see [9] above), causing her to feel that she lived a &#8216;hell on earth&#8217; (see [10] above).  From early on in her stay here, there was apparently much talk of divorce (see [10]).  The father was estranged from his own family. The mother gives a compelling account of being lonely and friendless in England, yearning for family and friends whom she had given up to join her husband.  All the while, the mother remained dependent on benefits from Ukraine, and her only bank account was in that country (into which her benefits were paid).  The support network of the maternal family had remained in Ukraine, and the mother had no support here.  </p>

The home she occupied belonged to her husband; it was a building site, unsafe for their toddler daughter.  This was not a home in which she chose to live, or in which she made any financial or emotional investment.  She rarely left the home.</p>

Such limited exposure as there was to the environment to which the mother and L had moved was insufficient to displace their profound connections with Ukraine, many of which (including family support, financial support and contact with friends) had in any event endured in spite of their physical separation.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Much of the narrative about life for the mother here in the crucial period is self-reported, and therefore requires critical scrutiny. I cannot place much reliance on the father&#8217;s accounts, given that he is, after all, a self-confessed liar. The mother&#8217;s compelling account of abusive family life has now in some small measure been retracted; I believe that she has, to some extent, recrafted her account now to minimise the picture of harm to L, anxious about the repercussions of local authority involvement.  Possibly she has done so because she feels she needs the father&#8217;s support to achieve the objective of a return to Ukraine.  It is of course just as likely that she has changed her account out of fear of the father, and/or in panic at the intervention of a public authority in a foreign state. I am satisfied that she is plainly desperately worried about the risk of losing her daughter.  Whatever the reason for her retraction, it is not convincing.  The mother&#8217;s original account of abuse is of course strongly evidenced by contemporaneously generated emails (see [9] and [10] above) in which she gives a compelling narrative of ill-treatment by the father.  The note on the mantelpiece and the father&#8217;s emails, seeking forgiveness, are all of the same piece.</p>

The mother reported to the social worker being &#8220;pulled from the bed&#8221; by the father &#8211; an allegation which she did not deny, when later asked about it. </p>

Isolation from friends and family, and associated dependence on the abuser, are common features of the lives of the abused victim. There is sufficient evidence before me on which to conclude, on balance, that this was indeed the experience of the mother, and the environment in which she and L were living in the weeks following their arrival here; the mother, I am satisfied, felt trapped by the father, and I accept that she was frightened by his threats. Such a stressful environment is not one in which this mother (or indeed any other person) would be able genuinely and authentically, let alone easily or quickly, to integrate into a new life in a new country; the factors in play here would, conversely, operate as formidable barriers to integration.</p>
