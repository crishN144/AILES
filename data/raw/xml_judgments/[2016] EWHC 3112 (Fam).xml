<span style="font-size:14pt">There is before the court an application to commit Sayed Gulab Shah Hashimi to prison for contempt of court. I make plain at the outset of this judgment that, for reasons which I will give, I propose to dismiss for all time that application. However, at the outset of this judgment I must frankly draw attention to a regrettable procedural defect which occurred today. So far as I am aware, I, personally, have never had any previous dealings with this case, and certainly no recent dealings. I, myself, read the papers for the first time yesterday evening. I did not, as perhaps I should have done, personally examine the published cause list for today to check that the case had been correctly listed for hearing in public, as any proceedings for committal must be.</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">Throughout this morning I have indeed sat publicly in open court. I have been robed and both counsel have been robed. But it was only at lunchtime today that I checked the cause list myself and saw to my dismay that the published cause list listed this matter as &#8220;Application in court as in chambers&#8221;. I have since seen a copy of the actual notice that was pinned on the notice board outside this court room this morning, and that notice also refers to &#8220;Application in court as in chambers&#8221;. The published cause list does give the surname of the alleged contemnor as &#8220;Hashimi&#8221;. The notice outside the door of the court did not give any name at all, and only the case number of the underlying proceedings.</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">As a result of that serious defect, I took two steps during the lunch adjournment. First, I caused a fresh notice to be posted outside the door of the court, which now states &#8220;For hearing in open court, application for the committal to prison of Sayed Gulab Shah Hashimi for contempt of court&#8221;, and continues by giving the court number of these proceedings and repeating the surname Hashimi.</span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">
<span style="font-size:14pt">The second step was that I arranged for my clerk to notify the Press Association office here in the Royal Courts of Justice that I am indeed hearing an application for committal in open court today. As a result of that telephone call, a journalist was indeed present when this hearing resumed at about two o&#8217;clock this afternoon, although I note that the journalist has subsequently left.</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">I deeply regret that irregularity. I take personal responsibility for it. I have learned the lesson that a judge must personally always check the cause list for defects of that kind. I can only say in my defence, or in some mitigation, that neither counsel, both of whom are exceptionally experienced, noticed or drew my attention to the defect.</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">I pass from that irregularity to the substance of this application to commit. The underlying proceedings concern a boy who was born in Afghanistan in late December 2009. If he is still alive he will now be approaching the age of seven. At the time of his birth, his parents, who are or were married to each other, were living together in Afghanistan. They are first cousins to each other. They have a common uncle. Within a very few weeks of the birth of the child, the father, who had recently been granted British citizenship, spoke to the mother about her travelling to England with him without, at that stage, the child. In this judgment I use the phrase &#8220;spoke to&#8221; as there may be some underlying dispute as to how far the mother acted as a result of encouragement, or persuasion, or coercion from the father, with which I do not further deal in this judgment. </span>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.50in">
<span style="font-size:14pt">The fact is that within about a month of the birth of the child, the mother and the father did both travel to England leaving the child at that stage in the care of the uncle. It is the case of the mother that she understood that the child would follow fairly soon to England once his capacity to enter the United Kingdom had been established. </span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">The mother has never seen that child again. For at least six years she has not had the slightest idea where her child is. She does not know whether he is still in Afghanistan, and, quite frankly, in view of the strife within that country in recent years, she cannot even reliably know whether her child is still alive. It is hard to imagine a greater suffering and torment than that which that mother must daily go through. </span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">She and the father continued to live together in England, and indeed a further child, a daughter, was born to them. By the time the daughter was born the parents had separated and, as I understand it, the father has never seen the daughter, although he does know perfectly well that the daughter is living with the mother in England, albeit at an address or whereabouts which are kept confidential from him.</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">The mother first began proceedings to try to establish the whereabouts of her son in early 2011. It is not necessary for the purposes of this judgment to describe the subsequent procedural history or the many court hearings which have taken place, including at the level of the Court of Appeal. I do, however, mention that both parents are publicly funded through legal aid. I have been told today that the approximate costs which have been incurred by the legal aid fund in relation to each parent since the first commencement of any proceedings in 2011, but not including the costs of this hearing today, are approximately &#163;41,000, including all VAT and disbursements in the case of the father, and &#163;63,660 in the case of the mother. The aggregate of those figures is &#163;104,660.</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">There was a fact finding hearing before Newton J in October and November 2015. Then, as now, the mother was represented by Mr Hassan Khan, instructed by Dawson Cornwell, solicitors, and the father was represented by Mr Paul Hepher, instructed by Jones Myers, solicitors. The course of the evidence and argument appears to have occupied a full five days between 26 to 30 October 2015. The judge reserved his judgment and gave it on 30 November 2015. The judgment of Newton J was delivered in private, but he gave leave for an anonymised version of it to be published and it was ascribed a neutral citation number of <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/3456" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 3456 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 3456 (Fam)</ref>.

<span style="font-size:14pt">In summary, Newton J concluded to the civil standard of proof that the father has always known, and did still at that date, November 2015, know the whereabouts of the child. It must be stressed that that was a judgment reached expressly on the civil standard of the balance of probability. With regard to the then current whereabouts of the child, Newton J said at para.21:</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">&#8220;I do not know and cannot speculate as to where [the child] may now be, but having regard to my very clear findings, I logically infer on all the evidence that it is reasonable to suppose that the father knows precisely where [the child] is to this day.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">Pausing there, it is important to observe that the way in which the judge carefully expressed himself as to the father&#8217;s knowledge of the child&#8217;s current whereabouts was that he &#8220;logically inferred&#8221; that it was &#8220;reasonable to suppose&#8221; that the father knows precisely where the child is.</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">In the light of that judgment there was a further hearing before Peter Jackson J on 26 May 2016. Again, he sat in private, but approved his judgment for publication in an anonymised form. That judgment was ascribed the neutral citation number <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/1252" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 1252 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 1252 (Fam)</ref>, and I have been informed by counsel that that judgment certainly is upon the BAILII website, and so has been, and is, available for anyone with an interest in this matter directly to read.</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">Peter Jackson J did two things. First, he decided, having regard to two decisions of the Supreme Court, known as </span>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re B</span>
<span style="font-size:14pt">, that the High Court should exercise its inherent jurisdiction in relation to this child. That was based upon the fact that he is a British citizen by descent (his father having been granted British citizenship shortly before he was born), and that the jurisdiction should be exercised in relation to him even although there is not a shred of evidence that he has ever set foot anywhere in the United Kingdom, let alone ever been habitually resident here. There has been no challenge to, or appeal from, that decision by Peter Jackson J. </span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">In my view, it clearly follows from the provisions of the rules, and most clearly from the provisions of Practice Direction PD37A, that the question of permission in this sort of situation is not a mere formality. Far from it, the application for permission clearly has to be supported by detailed affidavit evidence which, amongst other things, explains why the maker knew the statement to be false at the time it was made, and also explains why contempt proceedings would be appropriate in the light of the overriding objective. I will not in this judgment cite from the overriding objective in rule 1.1 of the Family Procedure Rules, but, as is well known, the overriding objective includes consideration of proportionality, the saving of expense, and the appropriate sharing of court time and resources. So the requirement of permission is an important protection and safeguard, not only for alleged contemnors, but also the wider public interest.</span>

That said, there must be some limits. As I have said, over &#163;100,000 of public money has already been expended on litigation in relation to the whereabouts of this child, who has in fact never, ever set foot in the United Kingdom. At some point, a judge will have to grapple with the overriding objective and considerations of cost and proportionality, and/or may have to decide whether the point has come at which the Attorney General, who is the guardian of the public interest, should decide how far to pursue committal proceedings in a situation such as this.</span>

<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt"> </span>
<span style="font-size:14pt">June 2016, which the father filed and served, does &#8220;deal with&#8221; the listed matters, in that it sets each one out and gives an answer to them. I suggested to Mr Hepher that it can surely be implied or read into the opening words of paragraph 1 that the statement must be a statement which is a true and honest one to the best of the father&#8217;s knowledge and belief. Mr Hepher does not accept that, and relies upon numerous authorities to the effect that in proceedings to commit someone to prison there must be absolute strictness, and the person concerned must know with complete clarity what it is that he must do, or refrain from doing. Mr Hepher submits that there is simply no room in circumstances such as this to imply anything into an order of that kind.</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">The second strand of Mr Hepher&#8217;s submissions is that, in any event, on all that is known about this case, the mother has no realistic prospect of proving to the required criminal standard of proof that the father&#8217;s statement of 6 June 2016 is in any material respect dishonest or untrue. It is, of course, the case that it flatly contradicts that which Newton J had already found in his judgment of 30 November 2015. But, as Mr Hepher points out and as I have already stressed, that was a judgment based purely on the civil standard of proof, and such relatively speculative reasoning as that &#8220;I logically infer &#8230; that it is reasonable to suppose that &#8230;&#8221; </span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">Mr Khan, on behalf of the mother, has frankly accepted that she has no other evidence than that which was deployed before Newton J. He submits, however, that Newton J only made his findings and expressed them on the civil standard because that was all that he was being asked at that stage to do. Mr Khan speculates, to put it no higher, that if Newton J had been considering the factual matters to the criminal standard he would still have been able to make, and would have made, the broad findings that he did. Mr Khan submits to me that, in principle, the mother should be permitted to mount her application to commit, and given the opportunity to deploy again all, or such parts as she wishes, of the evidence that was deployed before Newton J in order to seek to persuade the court to the higher, criminal standard that the father does know the whereabouts and other information in relation to the child and is being deliberately untruthful and dishonest.</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">It is at that point that considerations of proportionality may vividly arise. The hearing in front of Newton J lasted five full days, plus the day of judgment. It may be that less evidence would be deployed a second time round, but at all events a hearing measured in days, not hours, seems to be contemplated by Mr Khan.</span>

But I have come to the broad overall view that the present proposed application to commit, based as it is upon the terms of paragraph 1 of the order of 25 May 2016 and the contents of the statement of 6 June 2016, has low prospects of success. </span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">What I propose to do, however, is make a fresh order echoing, but in different terms to, that earlier order. I hope that the language of this fresh order will be so clear that it would be impossible for Mr Hepher or anyone else ever even to mount or renew an argument as to ambiguity. I shall order, in the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of this court in relation to a child who is a British citizen, that the father must, by a specified date, make and file and serve an affidavit on oath, or an affirmation, in which he gives true and honest answers to a relatively short list of questions. </span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">I will not in this judgment reproduce those questions. They are very direct questions, most of which first require a &#8216;yes&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217; answer. They focus exclusively on the current whereabouts of the child, and with whom he may be living, and upon when the father, himself, last had any direct or indirect contact or communication with the child. Mr Khan agrees that it is, frankly, premature at this stage to develop further questions with regard to such matters as the wellbeing or schooling of the child, or the languages he speaks. All that can be for another day, if ever the whereabouts of this child are ascertained.</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">The final matter to which I refer is the current status of the child in these proceedings. By an order made long ago in December 2014, this child was made a ward of court. I am not quite clear as to the circumstances in which, or the reasons why, he was made a ward of court at that stage. However, it is quite clear to me from my brief engagement with this case today that it is wholly inappropriate that this child continues to be a ward of this court, even if at some earlier stage it was appropriate. </span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">It is important to stress that the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to children may be, and frequently is, exercised without the child concerned being actually made a ward of court. When a child is made a ward of court, the court thereby assumes responsibility for decision making in relation to the child. This child is a British citizen, but, as I have now said several times, there is not a shred of evidence that he has ever set foot in the United Kingdom. It is of the essence of this case that neither the mother nor the court (and, so he says, the father) have the slightest idea where the child is or where he has been now for several years. In those circumstances, it seems to me both unnecessary and completely inappropriate that he should remain a ward of this court, since the court cannot realistically make any decisions in relation to him at all.</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">For those brief reasons I propose today, without I think much opposition from Mr Khan on behalf of the mother, to direct that the child hereby ceases to be a ward of this court. But the order will make clear, for the avoidance of doubt, that the court continues to assert and exercise its inherent jurisdiction to make orders in relation to, or in connection with, him and his whereabouts and wellbeing.</span>
