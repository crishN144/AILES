The father is of Egyptian descent and has dual Egyptian and Irish citizenship.  He has lived for a considerable number of years here in England and Wales, where he is a surgeon.  The mother is a citizen of Hungary.  She suggests in some emails, which she has recently sent, that she was not habitually resident in England and Wales but merely came to England and Wales last autumn to give birth to the child.  However, the statement of the father dated 27</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;February 2017 makes absolutely clear that, until she abruptly went to Hungary on 13</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;October 2016, the mother also had lived substantially in England for at least the previous ten years, albeit that she made some return visits to Hungary.</span></p>

They nevertheless appear to have spent considerable periods of time together.  As a result of that relationship the mother conceived a child in late 2015, or very early in 2016.  At one point she challenged the father as to whether in truth he is the father of that child.  But I am  satisfied that he is the father, as he himself asserts, since the mother commenced some proceedings in Hungary by a Writ of Summons dated 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February 2017, which expressly seeks a determination that the father, who is named in those proceedings, is indeed the father of this child.  So it is the express and positive contention and assertion by the mother herself, in her own proceedings in Hungary, that this man is the father of this child. </span></p>

Rights of custody were attributed to the father because the order expressly provided that the mother must not remove the child from England and Wales without his prior consent.  That order similarly attributed a right of custody to the court itself, which was clearly asserting its power to prevent the removal of the child from England and Wales.</span></p>

Of course, on that date, he was only just over two weeks old.  But there is nothing to suggest that in his short life up to that moment he had ever left England and Wales, in which he had been born.  At the time of his birth his father was habitually resident in England and Wales and, as I am satisfied, his mother was also habitually resident in England and Wales.  It is impossible to conceive that he was habitually resident in any other State than England and Wales, so he must either have been habitually resident in England and Wales or not habitually resident anywhere.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I appreciate, of course, that the younger a child is the harder it is, conceptually, to envisage a child being "habitually" resident anywhere.  For instance, in the first hour after the birth of a child it might seem rather unreal to describe him as being habitually resident anywhere, as the characteristics of "habitual" can scarcely be acquired within an hour.  But the law leans against an outcome which leaves a person, even a young baby, without any habitual residence, because of the importance of habitual residence as a connecting factor and basis of jurisdiction for proceedings in relation to children throughout Europe and, indeed, much of the rest of the world.  It seems to me clear and appropriate that immediately prior to his removal this child was, in fact, habitually resident here in England and Wales.</span></p>

In my view they clearly were.  During the child's short life his father has seen him several times, including most recently on Tuesday, 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2016.  The father had very deliberately sought and obtained the prohibited steps order on 12</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2016, and actively sought to serve it through the process server on 13</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2016.  In my view all those matters are clear indicators that he was actually exercising his rights of custody on the date of removal on 13</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2016.  So, also, was the court.  It had made a prohibited steps order only the day before, on 12</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2016, and that order had made provision for the preparation of evidence in the continuing proceedings, and had fixed a further hearing date, relatively soon thereafter, on 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 2016.  It seems to me quite clear that both the father and the court were actually and actively exercising their respective rights of custody.</span></p>

The process server describes that he went to the house seeking the mother, but he did not leave at the property the order or any of the supporting documents.  He does not say that he even informed the mother's own mother of his purpose in being at the property, or of the existence of the prohibited steps order.</span></p>
