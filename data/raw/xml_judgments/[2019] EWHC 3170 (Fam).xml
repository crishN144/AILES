That the role of the court under the 1980 Convention is strictly one of being procedurally ancillary to the relief that will be rendered in the court of the home state is made clear by Article 7.3 of the 1996 Hague Convention, which the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/329.html"/><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/329.html" style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0000FF"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] AC 1291" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] AC 1291</ref></a><a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/329.html">]</a> held substantially bolstered the operation of the 1980 Hague Convention.

To my mind, there was no settled agreement to a move to England. </p>

The very next day M booked tickets to the UK.  The purchase of tickets by M was not as a result of an arranged, pre-planned move with F, on a date agreed between them and with plenty of advance notice.  Rather, it was, in my judgment, a precipitous decision by M as a result of an unpleasant incident which led her to decide, definitively, that her future with the children lay elsewhere.  </p>

It was agreed that [M] would return to the UK with the children in order to give her the rest that she needed and you the opportunity to work on yourself and your own issues.

Only if there were such a concluded agreement could it be said that there was clear and unequivocal conduct such as to fall within the exception&#8230;.it would be most unfortunate if parents in this situation were deterred from seeking to make sensible arrangements, in consequence of what is usually an acknowledged breakdown in the relationship between them, for fear that the mere fact that they are able to contemplate that the child should remain where he has been taken will count against them in these proceedings.  Such negotiations are, if anything, to be encouraged.  They should not therefore necessarily fall within the exception or necessarily lead to the conclusion as a matter of fact that there was a subjective state of mind that was wholly content for the child to remain here."</span></p>

The court is entitled to have regard to the policy aims of the Hague Convention, namely that questions regarding the child's welfare should be determined in the country of their habitual residence. Other factors relevant to determining the question of whether the court should exercise its discretion to order a return will include (but will not be limited to) the child's degree of connection to each country (in the sense of with which country does the child have the closer connection in terms of his life, his first language, his race or ethnicity, his religion, his culture, and his education so far), the length of time the child has spent in the country and the effect of the decision on the child's primary carer.  In the context of non-Hague cases, the Supreme Court has held that it is likely to be better for a child to return to his home country for any disputes about his future to be decided there (</span><a href="https://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed144253" style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;color:#441670">Re J (A </a><a href="https://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed144253" style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;color:#441670">Child)(Custody Rights: Jurisdiction)</a><a href="https://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed144253" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;color:#441670"/><a href="https://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed144253" style="font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt;color:#441670"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 1 AC 80" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 1 AC 80</ref></a><a href="https://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed144253" style="font-size:11pt"/><span style="font-size:11pt">at [32]). &#8220; </span></p>

M sets out a pattern of anger, shouting, volatile behaviour and unreliability.  In 2016 she says that F threw her down the stairs in a fit of temper. He has tried to choke her and has thrown her to the floor. In 2018 he smashed her laptop and dragged her across the garden.  Again in 2018 he was out of control, flooded the bathroom, spat at and hit M.  In late 2018 he killed a chicken in front of M. On 2 December 2018, the incident which provoked M&#8217;s departure, he smashed a cupboard door in M&#8217;s face.  Other, similar incidents, are relied upon.  F denies any such behaviour on his part, but it seems to me that I should take the allegations at face value for these purposes, without in any way making findings of fact. </p>

Thereafter, she would be entitled to enter and remaining in the United States for up to 90 days under the ESTA scheme. Although I have described the state of evidence as unsatisfactory, it does now seem clear that as a minimum she will be entitled to entry under the ESTA scheme; the only uncertainty is whether she will be prevented from so doing for up to 2 months. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.04in">If I were to order a return in circumstances where M cannot accompany the children because she would be refused entry to the United States, the consequences for these young children would be, to my mind, very serious indeed.  She has always been their primary carer, particularly in the 10 months or so since coming to England.  All the discussions have been on the basis of the children living with M. F regards her as an excellent mother. Separation of the children from their mother in such circumstances would carry grave consequences indeed. However, on the information before me, there is a maximum period of 2 months until the conditional green card is relinquished and during which M may be prevented from entering the United States.  Thereafter, M can accompany the children under the ESTA scheme. </p>

She left the country just before she was granted the conditional green card and did not return, even for short periods of time, to ensure its continuity. She has submitted the card to be relinquished without either notifying F&#8217;s legal team or, so it appears, taking specialist US immigration law advice. </p>

That is, in my judgment, sufficient time for the United States court to seize the relevant welfare issues. I bear in mind also that the ESTA permits multiple 90 days visits within its 2 year validity. </p>

I am entitled to assume that the United States courts and authorities will deal appropriately and justly with issues such as this arising out of abduction cases. I note the passage in Clarke Hall and Morrison at 5-127 where it is said that &#8220;&#8230;US rules have since been eased through the use of significant public benefit parole to facilitate the return of an abductor who might otherwise have no right of entry&#8221;. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.04in">However, I am satisfied that if M were unable to accompany the children back to the United States, that would constitute an intolerable situation for the children and expose them to a grave risk of harm.  Although the evidence on this is thin, M&#8217;s case at its highest is that it will take up to 2 months before she will be able to enter under the ESTA scheme. I am willing to accept this at face value.  It seems to me, therefore that the options are (i) to order a forthwith return, placing the onus on M to apply back to court for an extension of time if she is able to satisfy the court that she is unable at present to enter the United States for reasons beyond her control or (ii) to make an order for return by no later than 2 months from today.  I prefer the latter course.  That allows M time to regularise her immigration position and should avoid the need for further applications to court.  </p>
