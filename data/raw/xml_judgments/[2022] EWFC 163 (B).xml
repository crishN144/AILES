The report notes that the mother has difficulty maintaining focus over long periods and has difficulties processing sentences exceeding three key words. The report discusses some of her challenges with expressive and receptive language. As a result the hearing has mostly proceeded in 45 minute segments followed by 10 minute breaks. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In July and September 2019 staff at a Hospital made referrals to the applicant. They noted the mother was homeless and that she had made allegations she was the subject of domestic abuse. She was accommodated at a refuge. The father says he required her to leave his home, as she was responsible for aggressive outbursts, smashed furniture and damaged his home. The applicant notes a contemporaneous police report corroborates the father&#8217;s version.  Concerns were raised by health visitors in late 2019 that the mother was abusing alcohol and had neither purchased nor obtained items in preparation for the impending birth. A Child and Family Assessment recommended that after birth EA be placed on a &#8216;Child In Need&#8217; plan with additional support.  The midwifery teams reported that after EA&#8217;s birth the mother smelled of alcohol, EA&#8217;s clothes smelled of cigarettes and the mother was reluctant to feed her new born baby girl. A subsequent alcohol hair strand test did not evidence chronic alcohol use. On or around 19 February the mother left the refuge and resumed residing with the father. Concerns were raised in respect of EA&#8217;s welfare - it was alleged there were frequent altercations between the mother and father. On 17 March 2020 EA was placed on a Child Protection Plan under the category of neglect. In May 2020 the father&#8217;s GP noted concerns about his mental health, that he suffered from bipolar and was not taking his medication. On 19 November 2020 the police attended the family home because of a domestic dispute between the parents. The mother is reported to have been &#8216;removed&#8217; because of vandalism of the flat and the EA was left in the care of her father. </span></p>

In an assessment report dated 10 April 2021 the independent social worker, Monique Anthony, reported significant concerns about the mother&#8217;s parenting capacity which could not be addressed in a reasonable time frame. The relationship between the parents was described as &#8216;co-dependent, volatile, hostile and abusive&#8217;. A recommendation was made that EA required a long term placement with family or friends or approved adopters. </span></p>

Her home environment was described as &#8216;unpredictable and unsafe, characterised by chronic neglect of her emotional and developmental needs&#8217;.

She accepted she had argued with the father after EA was born and the police were called out as she was throwing things around. She asked for support and noted EA would start nursery in May 2021. She emphasised that apart from one week, she had been with EA throughout. In September 2021, however, she filed a statement saying: &#8220;I want EA to be placed with MT, I know EA will be safe, will have good routines, be loved and properly looked after with good routines.&#8221; In a further witness statement the mother accepted she broke the prohibited steps order and regularly came to the father&#8217;s house. She said she came to clean at his request and the house was &#8220;very messy&#8221; and the bathroom was &#8220;disgusting&#8221;. She accepted she had also stayed at the father&#8217;s flat.

In that statement he gave evidence that the mother had not returned to his home and she had not lived at his home since the 21 July 2021.

He denied the mother had returned to live and gave evidence that he &#8220;would not allow her to enter my home&#8221;.  He acknowledged he had permitted a lodger from Pakistan who had immigration difficulties to stay in his &#8220;loft&#8221; for a short time.

He put forward other friends to help him with his care of EA given the S's would not proceed with special guardianship.

He acknowledged challenges working with her but thought that on the whole their relationship had not broken down. He explained EA did not spend Easter weekends with MT because he had wished to celebrate Easter with friends and EA in the aftermath of the global pandemic restrictions being finally lifted.</span></p>

She confirmed the applicant&#8217;s proposed outcome for the proceedings was that a special guardianship order be made to MT. She explained why the mother was not capable of caring for EA. She noted the applicant was &#8220;initially .. satisfied&#8221; with the father&#8217;s care of EA but went on to note his care of her appeared to be deteriorating. That father was resistant to MT; he was not open and transparent and he was struggling given his age to provide consistent care to EA. Concerns remained that his house was cluttered and not clean. She detailed that a series of unannounced visits over the summer of 2022 painted a picture of concern bordering on neglect of EA, who had rashes and bites. She gave evidence that MT had told the applicant about the lodger and that the father stated this was only for a brief period and he lived upstairs in the loft. EA was noted to be &#8216;relaxed and comfortable&#8217; in her father&#8217;s care. She was described as &#8220;clean and well presented&#8221; and &#8220;does not lack in regards to play and stimulation&#8221;.

It was noted the health visitor reported she had a healthy diet, a good routine and is &#8220;meeting her developmental milestones and there are no concerns&#8221;. It was said that at a meeting the father had said he would only care for EA for another 2-5 years but then he later retracted this. On the basis the court made a special guardianship order with MT, it was suggested EA have once a week unsupervised contact with her father and contact on special occasions and fortnightly supervised contact with her mother and special occasions.

They have offered support to the father and EA and will continue to do so. He warmly described EA, her likes and dislikes. He emphasised EA is a  &#8220;delightful and happy child&#8221; and described her as very clever. He had few concerns about the father&#8217;s home and was last there about one week ago. He was very disappointed to hear about the lodger and that the parents breached the Prohibited Steps Order. He emphasised that the father is devoted to EA. He told me, contrary to Mr Wale&#8217;s written report, he had met Mr and Mrs S and been to their house. His evidence was honest, clear and straightforwardly given.</span></p>

He was directed to report to the court and was provided with a letter of instructions. He variously carried out in-person direct observations, conducted telephone interviews and reviewed papers. In his first report, dated 1 April 2022 he concluded the father &#8220;is currently capable of continuing to be the main carer for EA&#8230;there is good evidence of [the father] being able to meet EA&#8217;s overall &#8216;day to day&#8217; welfare and safety needs in a calm, caring, nurturing and proficient enough manner&#8230;.EA has a very established, secure, loving and stable relationship with her father.&#8221; He considered the shared care whereby EA spent the week with her father and the weekends with MT appropriate and it was not necessary for the father to care for EA full time. He opined &#8220;In an overall balanced sense and in applying the principle of &#8216;good enough&#8217; parenting, I consider that [the father] is able to keep EA safe from physical harm. I also note he recorded the father position that &#8220;He [the father] was clear that he would not breach any safety plan put in place around mother&#8217;s contact with EA&#8211; including not allowing the mother to visit the family home or have any form of unauthorised contact with EA&#8221;. In his second report, dated 2 June 2022, Mr Wale was confronted with the reality that the father had permitted the lodger to stay in his home and had breached the Prohibited Steps Order (hereafter &#8220;the PSO&#8221;) by letting the mother stay in his home. The father acknowledged to Mr Wale the lodger had stayed but continued to deny to Mr Wale that the mother had stayed in breach of the PSO. He told Mr Wale the mother may have entered his home without his permission. The report records the depth of the father&#8217;s anger directed to MT of her informing the applicant what the mother had told her about the lodger and the mother staying at the father&#8217;s home, but also more widely MT&#8217;s concerns.  His second report records the fact the father&#8217;s home was dirty and cluttered and the toilet was &#8220;completely unacceptable&#8221;.  Further he noted the very poor relationship between MT and the father, describing it as &#8220;highly problematic, mistrusting and not a proper basis for safe and consistent care to be provided to EA..&#8221; </span></p>

It was noted &#8220;[the father] is very regretful and apologetic around previously allowing the mother into his home against the agreed plan in place and; also, around allowing a man to live somewhere in his property.

For the record, I cannot conclude that this would be for the entire duration of EA&#8217;s minority &#8211; but, nonetheless, possibly for a good proportion of the same. Such possible plan would need to include all members of the support network, being able to meet and openly communicate with each other &#8211; this includes MT. Such possible plan must make clear all of the necessary expectations of everyone involved. The network will need to have a clear monitoring role alongside that of providing support. The whole exercise is likely to be much advanced by way of a &#8216;network planning meeting&#8217; being held.&#8221;</span></p>

He described the father as &#8220;overall coping&#8221;. He considered with a &#8220;proper safety plan&#8221; the risks to EA could be managed because EA was now verbal and the support network (by which he meant the Ss, the Ps, MT and social services for as long as they remain involved) was robust enough.

I consider it necessary that I do find the threshold is crossed. First, because it is an important aspect of Ms Chan&#8217;s case, on behalf of the father, that the protective regime he proposes includes the oversight and safeguards of the 12 month Supervision Order. To properly and fully evaluate that option, as I must, I should consider it to be an option open to the court. Secondly, it is also important for EA, and those who care for her, to know what the background to these proceedings is and why orders of the court are necessary.

In other words, it involves a less fundamental interference with existing legal relationships. The court will need to bear Article 8 of ECHR in mind, and to be satisfied that its order is a proportionate response to the problem, having regard to the interference with family life which is involved. In choosing between adoption and special guardianship, in most cases Article 8 is unlikely to add anything to the considerations contained in the respective welfare checklists. Under both statutes the welfare of the child is the court's paramount consideration, and the balancing exercise required by the statutes will be no different to that required by Article 8. However, in some cases, the fact that the welfare objective can be achieved with less disruption of existing family relationships can properly be regarded as helping to tip the balance."</span></p>

She loves her father, enjoys her time with her mother and loves MT (&#8220;mummy&#8221;). There is ample evidence to support the fact she enjoys spending time with her father who is regularly described as gentle with her. MT described EA in her written and oral evidence, as being unsettled when she returned her to her father&#8217;s care, presumably mostly on Sundays. I do not doubt EA is at times unsettled and that may be because she dislikes the constant change or some crankiness creeps in when she is tired. Overall, the evidence points to EA having a very close attachment to her father. She needs him in her life. He has been a constant. EA also enjoys her time spent with a wider selection of adults, children and pets. Having listened carefully to the evidence EA has a positive view of the time she spends with the Ss and their children (and their dog). She also enjoys her time with the Ps on Thursdays and enjoys being with their wide family of children and grandchildren. EA especially enjoys the love, support and care given to her by MT. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">EA&#8217;s physical needs require her to be kept safe from harm, to be remain clean, well-nourished and appropriately fed. She needs a clean and largely uncluttered home. She needs carers who will protect her from strangers who might deliberately harm her and family members who might not realise they are acting in a way that is harmful to her. Her current educational needs require her timely attendance at nursery (currently 15 hours per week) and wider stimulation through play and social inter-action. She is clever and her two year old intellect plainly requires considerable stimulation and engagement and this, in turn, involves time and patience on the part of the adults in her life. Her emotional needs are more complex. I agree with the evidence of the child&#8217;s guardian  and adopt her evidence (set out above) within my analysis. At the forefront of EA&#8217;s needs are a constancy of physical, verbal and emotional warmth from the adults who care for her. She needs a consistency across the caring adults in this regard. She needs the adults who care for her, to be united in the purpose that is cherishing her welfare, her physical and emotional growth and the development of her education. It is not enough they individually strive for this with her. She needs adults who are capable of working together, putting aside their differences, and effectively communicating with each other, for her. EA is already, I suspect, smart enough to know when that does not take place. Such failures are already likely to be damaging her and the risk of this damage grows as her receptive communication skills and emotional instincts develop with age and maturity.  </span></p>

What is described above will remain, yet become more challenging. She may face the risk of greater dangers of physical harm going to and from school and in school. Her educational needs will develop as she must simultaneously access the curriculum and develop greater social skills as she navigates the world of teachers in classrooms and the yet more challenging world of peers in the playground. Her emotional needs as she navigates these changes will be at the apex of this complex, little world. It is against this background that, in my judgment, I am clear that EA needs stability and consistency now but particularly for the years ahead. It should also go without saying, but must be said, that she needs to be protected from the risk of serious harm. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">EA has dealt with a number of changes of circumstances in her short life. At first, she lived with her mother alone, then with parents. Then with her father alone. Then with her father and the Ss. Thereafter, and currently, with her father and MT with support from two other families. I cannot be clear about the impact of this on her. Much of the evidence in these proceedings focuses on the adults, not on her. It would not be right for her to be subjected to over assessment. However, it is a fact that EA has lived with change and yet is still described as happy and clever. Furthermore, the evolution of living arrangements which would (eventually) involve EA living with MT but seeing her parents is not a drastic one. She currently spends the largest period of un-interrupted time in MT&#8217;s care. She will continue to see her father and mother and the plan, placed before me, is for her to eventually have overnight unsupervised time with the father. Any potential change, if the Special Guardianship order were to be approved, is significant, but it must not be overstated when seen against the context of both EA&#8217;s history and her current arrangements.   </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In my judgment, EA is at risk of three different but inter-related strands of significant harm. The first is the risk of physical and emotional harm arising as a result of her father&#8217;s inability to understand or foresee the dangers and/or harms that may befall EA through the actions of others. This is plainly evident from the agreed factual background that he accepted a lodger in the family home during these proceedings without informing the applicant or foreseeing this man could present a risk to EA. It is not necessary to determine whether this man slept in the loft throughout or spent some of the time in the father&#8217;s flat, or to determine how long he was there (one week or two months). It was potentially harmful to EA and the father&#8217;s own evidence was to discount any risk. The father was also misleading about this. Secondly, the father, I suspect through kindness to the mother (not wanting to see her homeless), consented to accommodating the mother in his home. Both parents acted in breach of the PSO. Their volatile relationship, frequent arguments and violence should play no part in the safe and secure home EA needs. </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The second is the risk emotional harm to EA of growing up in circumstances where she has multiple homes and multiple carers, particularly in circumstances where the carers cannot communicate with each other properly and row with each other. This lacks stability, consistency and the emotional certainties that EA needs. EA may not feel certain about where her home is, now, and in the future. She may be bewildered by frequent changes. In my judgment, she is at risk of significant harm if she is deprived of the stability she needs to grow emotionally (feeling loved and secure); educationally (meeting her educational potential as a clever child); and socially (maintain good peer and adult relations beyond her immediate family) because of the uncertainty caused by multiple carers and as a result of their disagreements. Whilst stability and consistency for all children are important, stability for EA now, and in the next few years, is of considerably more importance (and instability presents considerably more risk of greater harm) given: i. her mother&#8217;s challenges; ii. her father&#8217;s honest (and correct) acknowledgement he cannot care for her on his own; and iii. the very significant changes and challenges that have already taken place (such as weekend care changing from Mr and Mrs S to MT).   </span></p>

Her father plays a very significant role in her life. Unless a Gillick competent EA, or the appropriate authorities for valid reasons decide otherwise, he should continue to regularly have contact with her so that she continues to know him, feels his love and gentleness and thereby understands who he is, so she can understand herself. This must not be under-estimated and MT should be supported to understand this by the applicant. Relatedly, EA&#8217;s relations with the Ss and  Ps should also not be marginalised. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">There are many positives about the father&#8217;s capabilities. His love and gentleness are apparent. There are many strengths to his hands-on care too. The written evidence of the health visitor is very positive. The feedback from the nursey raises no challenges. The applicant themselves have managed the situation with an interim Supervision Order and not removed EA from the father&#8217;s care. They themselves have praised his efforts. Mr Wale sees the father&#8217;s care as the appropriate outcome. But undoubtedly the father cannot now, and will increasingly in the future, be unable to offer EA the stability and consistency she needs. For the reasons I have endeavoured to explain above, EA&#8217;s current and future complex emotional needs cannot be met with instability and inconsistency without risking her emotional wellbeing.  Nor has the father satisfied me, given his untruthfulness to the court, to the applicant and to Mr Wale, that he is able to protect EA from the harm of others or from the damage which may come about from his own volatile interactions with EA&#8217;s mother. </span></p>

I did not find his third report persuasive in circumstances where his second report made clear the unsuitability of the father in the light of the breach of the PSO and lodger situation. In as much as I was invited to trust in the wider support network I simply do not think this is robust and realistic enough to protect EA from the harm cause by instability, lack of consistency and adults who do not see eye to eye.</span></p>

It would involve the least change. There are positives, which are highlighted in the reports from the Health Visitor and the Nursery. The father&#8217;s love for EA is not doubted.  However, it would not avoid the risk of emotional harm brought about by the instability of multiple carers and multiple homes. It would not present sufficient certainty. Even with a supervision order, EA&#8217;s physical and emotional needs would be at risk of harm, given the background of the breach of the PSO and the lodger situation, which both took place during the interim Supervision Order period. The father and his plan do not have the capabilities to protect EA in these areas. The Supervision Order has neither created stability or consistency. The reports that EA is happy does not diminish from this analysis: happiness is not the same as achieving the stability and consistency that EA needs now and in the short to mid-term future.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The Special Guardian Order would create change for EA and she would miss her father. This can be (partly) ameliorated with contact and support. EA&#8217;s emotional and physical needs are more likely to be advanced and protected in MT&#8217;s care. She will have the stability and consistency she needs. She will know her home and this will provide her with the secure platform to develop and mature. From there she will be provided with the stable emotional base to go forth and grow and do well emotionally, educationally and socially. She will be protected, as she has been to date in MT&#8217;s care, from the risk of physical harm of others or harm by witnessing her parents&#8217;, at times, acrimonious relationship. A Special Guardianship order would also create much stability in EA&#8217;s mind, given there are some doubts in the father&#8217;s mind, and professional concerns, about his ability to care for EA as he further ages.  The last option of an adjournment is a non-starter. It involves delay and a wholly uncertain potential assessment of a range of disparate adults. It does not provide for the coherent emotional stability and consistency I have tried to describe in the paragraphs above, now or in the future, that EA deserves. Nor is there sense in considering a potential but uncertain, future special guardian (who has not hitherto put themselves forward) when a candidate is before the court in circumstances where the evidence amply demonstrates she has the parenting capabilities and EA knows and loves her. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The father, through Ms Chan, submits the Special Guardianship Order would amount to a violation of his right to respect for a family life. As set out above, I have tried to explain why such an order is required to protect the welfare of EA and is in her best interests. Whilst her welfare is my paramount consideration, as a public authority, I must properly consider EA&#8217;s father&#8217;s rights. I observe, first, that a Special Guardianship Order which will preserve his parental responsibility because disposal in this way, does not remove his parental responsibility entirely, although his exercise of it will be limited given the statutory scheme places principal responsibility with the Special Guardian. The Special Guardian&#8217;s rights take priority over his and MT can make decisions for EA in the exercise of her parental responsibility. EA needs, as the Guardian observed, someone to be in control. He will, of course, continue to see EA regularly. EA will no longer continue to share residence between the father&#8217;s home and MT&#8217;s. She will live with her Special Guardian, whilst enjoying contact with her father. There are therefore interferences with the father&#8217;s Article 8 rights to respect for his family life with his daughter and I do not underestimate those. These are, however, more limited than the interferences if the court were asked, and made, an adoption/placement order. The father will continue to play a role in EA&#8217;s life and at times exercise his parental responsibility. I am entirely satisfied that EA&#8217;s rights and her need for stability, consistency and to be protected from the risk of future physical and emotional harm, justify the making of the special guardianship order. Such an outcome is necessary to protect her from emotional harm and the risk of physical harm and is proportionate as her protection cannot be more easily achieved.     </span></p>

I have considered this matter carefully. Stability and consistency may sound insubstantial to many. It may feel far removed from chronic neglect or actual harm or the even worse calumnies inflicted upon children by their parents, often seen in the family courts. However, the converse of stability is instability.  EA&#8217;s welfare demands more. Against the background described in this judgment, taking into account her welfare as the court&#8217;s paramount consideration, stability and consistency will help EA, and those who love her, to achieve the best welfare outcomes for her. Further and importantly, it must also be acknowledged that the court has found that neither parent can adequately protect EA from future risk of significant harm, as is explained above.  In the circumstances there is no violation of the parental human rights. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I have also considered contact and have done so before and after making the Special Guardianship order. Contact between EA and her parents will be part of the exercise of parental responsibility by the appointed Special Guardian. I am told in evidence MT will afford respect to the parents and protect and nurture EA&#8217;s relationship with them. She must do so assiduously with both, particularly with her father, who will grieve my decision. EA needs both her parents. She particularly needs some continuity with her father, his love for her and his gentleness. These proceedings have not doubted his love for her, although sadly he will likely not have understood or felt that. I have considered the applicant&#8217;s transition plan which determines that contact is in EA&#8217;s best interest. I expect MT to respect that. She must now set aside her difficulties with the father and work with him to help EA understand her evolving circumstances. She must take the initiative. Anything less from MT would be to betray the confidence entrusted in her by the court. I foresee she will honour that, for  EA&#8217;s sake and I thank her for taking on the task of being EA&#8217;s Special Guardian. EA is special and MT will be her guardian: protecting her includes advancing her relationship with her parents, even when this is difficult, which is likely to be the case in the months ahead.  For these reasons I decline to make some form of Child Arrangements Order in respect of contact. My conclusions are reinforced by the fact the applicant will fund mediation between the father and MT. I also anticipate that MT will properly consider that EA&#8217;s welfare will likely be advanced by having on-going contact with Mr and Mrs S and their family. EA has spent much time in her short life with them. She enjoys it. This family may have a role to play in her life. Such commitment and love should not be easily discounted. Possibly the same can be said for the P family but I leave that to EA&#8217;s Special Guardian&#8217;s evaluation. </span></p>
