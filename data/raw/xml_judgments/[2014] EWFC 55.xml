She is a little girl who is a product of a partial surrogacy agreement between her biological father, JD, 43 years of age, and his partner, AC , 47 years of age, and her biological surrogate mother, Wendy , 27 years. The adults met via an internet website upon which Wendy had posted her details effectively offering herself as a surrogate. AC saw those  details  and  contacted  Wendy and  the  matter  swiftly proceeded  from  there.  I will rehearse the matter in more detail in due course but, very briefly, an arrangement was reached between Wendy , AC and JD in 2012 that Wendy would carry a child for them using her  own egg and JD&#8217;s sperm.</span></p>

It is a cautionary tale as to what can go wrong in unregulated surrogacy. Such arrangements can no doubt work very well and there are likely to be many happy families in this country where surrogacy has been a success.   However, because of the special nature of surrogacy arrangements, they demand mature, balanced and sensitive handling. Surrogacy should not be approached without very considerable and careful reflection in respect of all of the ramifications for the child and the members of the families involved. A child is not a commodity to be bought and sold. This child is an individual for whom the consequences of the arrangements will have a lifelong impact.</span></p>

She describes also having fits, dependent upon her stress level at the time. This, of course, is said to be an incorrect assertion made by MH, as it is said that AC has not had a fit since 2010. The form is signed by AC; there is no mention on the form of a hysterectomy, partial or otherwise; nor is there any mention of hysterectomy in the list of medical conditions in respect of the client interview form completed by the health practitioner on 18</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:7.5pt">th </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11.5pt">February 2014, at E22.

I am satisfied, so that I am sure rather than on the balance of probabilities that AC has blatantly lied about what happened at this interview.

There are a number of reasons why I dismiss this scurrilous allegation. Firstly, the health practitioner was striking in her presentation as a witness of the truth, especially in contrast to the parties in this case who have lied so much to this court. Secondly, it was hard to understand why this smart, attractive, young woman would want to carry out this sexually abusive act on an older woman in this context; even if she was so inclined she would clearly be putting her job in jeopardy and risk prosecution.</span></p>

Fourthly, AC took no steps to report this sexual assault upon her or complain to anyone until the content of her concerning interview was raised with her about a month later. Fifthly, some four months afterward, AC still has not made any complaint to the police about this alleged sexually abusive act and yet she visited the police last weekend and made a detailed statement about alleged threats made against her by Wendy .Sixthly, the health practitioner was so concerned  about Ms C that she made an immediate  referral to AC&#8217;s general practitioner. Why would someone who has just perpetrated a gross sexual offence draw attention to what she had done and risk exposure by involving a health care professional immediately afterwards?</span></p>

This behaviour was not explained by AC at all in evidence. AC was apparently rocking in her chair and she looked to be hiding in her coat at times. The health practitioner is a registered nurse and an approved disability specialist. She is used to seeing fragile people; that is the whole tenor of her job. I cannot repeat the whole of the detail set out at E23 but it is noticeable that AC does not mention A or JD, she only mentions R and D and &#8216;a friend&#8217;.  She does mention an old friend called NS; there was no mention of NS in the file notes in advance of interview, the health practitioner told me, and therefore this information could only have come from AC and yet she denies it.</span></p>

AC reported that the voices told her to harm herself and that she would scratch her arm and bathe in bleach. When Ms C was asked about this in evidence, in my judgment, she minimised these actions, talking about a scratch to her arm as though it was a scratch that anybody might come by as opposed to something that was deliberately caused as a result of mental distress, which is clearly what she was talking about to the general practitioner.</span></p>

The couple failed to explain what the children were told in relation to the hospital when they were brought up to visit relatives in the Durham area and see their mother. These were relatively brief visiting periods as I understand it from their evidence.  This is a clear prioritisation of the surrogacy over the needs of R and D. It was not enough, in my judgment to say that mother&#8217;s absence was compensated for by JD&#8217;s presence. AC is their mother, first and foremost, and they clearly need her. At best, the level of visiting between mother and children in this period was once per week, if that evidence can be accepted.

I note, of course, that AC is saying that some of the workers she has had a bad experience with and therefore she does not trust them so I am truly concerned as to whether she can work openly and honestly with anyone given her history and her recent behaviour.</span></p>

In October 2013 he did not want the Children&#8217;s Guardian to contact his ex- wife, JoD, and T because they did not know that A was not AC&#8217;s child. The true situation had to be explained to T so that the Children&#8217;s Guardian could go and visit her in December 2013 and discuss matters. Ironically, of course, T said she had guessed about the surrogacy but said that she had not raised it with her father. Contrary to JD&#8217;s assertion  that  their  relationship  is  &#8216;awesome&#8217;,  T  told  the  Children&#8217;s  Guardian  that, although  she felt affection  for her father, she could not talk to him about important personal issues and therefore she had been talking to AC with regard to her self-harming behaviour because AC understood.

There was clearly a necessity to discuss this issue with her mother. They, as parents with parental responsibility, should have been sorting out appropriate plans for their fragile daughter. JoD, ex wife, confirmed to the Guardian that she had not been told of the surrogacy by father. She described him as not a responsible parent and that the relationship between him and T was more about gaming.</span></p>

R and D&#8217;s situation, as I have already indicated, appears to be more positive than it was when AC cared alone. The relationship between the two adults appears, on the surface at least, to be mutually satisfying. Visitors to their home describe it as warm and a calm family home. A is provided with a good level of basic care and physically she is thriving. There is no indication of any emotional damage from their care. She is loved and wanted now but she does not pose many challenges to the couple at the present; she may do in the future. We do not know how she will develop. I consider that this couple do not have the skills to meet her emotional needs in the future, even with support, very sadly for them.</span></p>

A choice to have a surrogate child is a free choice and that is not a matter of criticism by this court. However, when one does embark on surrogacy, it is imperative that one has the interests of the child as the paramount consideration at all times and not simply as a mantra that is trotted out to pacify an enquiring professional.

The assertion that she is disadvantaged as a result of having a learning disability is of course an appropriate one to make but the assessment of her mild to moderate learning disability is not a definitive one, as I have referred to earlier. It was said likely to be affected by her mental health issues. The more mentally healthy she is the more able she will be to manage her life and yet she has persistently failed to take up offers of counselling which have been made available to her. She prefers to put her terrible experiences in a box and not open that box as she has said. Simplistically, she and Mr D consider that she now has a caring partner and so she will be fine.</span></p>

She persistently had no answer for the myriad   of   evidential   examples   of   her   inability   to   consistently   cooperate   with professionals;  lying  to  them,  failing  to  turn  up  for  appointments  which  had  been scheduled to help her. She clearly requires some very long term counselling and mental health  support  in order  to recover  from her appalling experiences  over  the  years.  A</span></p>

I agree wholeheartedly with the Guardian that, whilst Mr D appears to be a devoted partner who shows her a considerable amount of support, he is masking her difficulties by pretending that she does not have any. Colluding with her is not helping her to take responsibility and face up to her considerable difficulties. The responsibility of caring for R and D is a significant one. The evidence as to R&#8217;s recent sexual flirtations with boys and men over the internet demonstrates the depth of the challenge for the couple. Both children have very considerable learning difficulties and require a great deal of support and reassurance. The transition  for both of them into adulthood  is likely to be complex.  In my judgment, meeting those needs alone will be more than enough for this couple.</span></p>

T does not have the difficulties which Ms C&#8217;s children do but she clearly  has  some   emotional   difficulties   with  some   rather   troubling   self-harming behaviour. As a child of divorcing parents, not yet divorced, she could have done without her father moving away to Whitby, necessitating much less contact with her and then a surrogate  baby,  perhaps  in  her  own  mind,  taking  her  place  in  his  affections.  It  is noticeable that it is said by Mr D that he did not have contact in the summer of 2013; perhaps T was upset by the surrogacy.</span></p>

I do not consider that this couple have the skills which would be required  to meet A&#8217;s individual needs in addition to the needs of their existing children. They demonstrated a complete lack of appreciation of those children&#8217;s emotional needs hitherto. They do not really accept that failure and I am not satisfied that there is work, which they would accept and consistently and meaningfully  cooperate with, which would enhance their ability to meet A&#8217;s needs.</span></p>

The parties have all behaved appallingly. Even when under the spotlight of the court and despite clear requests to behave, on their own evidence, dependent upon who can be believed of course, they have colluded, squabbled, demanded money with menaces, lied and effectively bribed their way through these court proceedings. Clearly they thought they could circumvent the court and fix the matter one way or the other.</span></p>

There would remain a risk of emotional harm, even in a contact situation, or even the possibility of a snatch scenario at worst. Indirect annual contact, as planned, will be sufficient, in my judgment, to meet her identity needs.
