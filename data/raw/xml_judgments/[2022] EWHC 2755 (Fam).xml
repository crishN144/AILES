The appellant appeals against the order of a circuit judge in the Family Court at West Cumbria, made on 20 December 2021.  The order was made following a judgment delivered at the conclusion of a hearing on the same day.  Both parties at that hearing were represented by counsel.</p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.98in">&#8220;Like any judgment, the judgment of the Deputy Judge [i.e., the judge appealed against in that case] has to be read as a whole, and having regard to its context and structure. The task facing a judge is not to pass an examination, or to prepare a detailed legal or factual analysis of all the evidence and submissions he has heard. Essentially, the judicial task is twofold: to enable the parties to understand why they have won or lost; and to provide sufficient detail and analysis to enable an appellate court to decide whether or not the judgment is sustainable. The judge need not slavishly restate either the facts, the arguments or the law. To adopt the striking metaphor of Mostyn J in&#160;SP v EB and KP <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/3964" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 3964 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 3964 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] 1 FLR 228" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] 1 FLR 228</ref>, para 29, there is no need for the judge to "incant mechanically" passages from the authorities, the evidence or the submissions, as if he were "a pilot going through the pre-flight checklist."</p>

This is particularly true of an unreserved judgment such as the judge gave in this case &#8230; These reasons should be read on the assumption that, unless he has demonstrated the contrary, the judge knew how he should perform his functions and which matters he should take into account. This is particularly true when the matters in question are so well known as those specified in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25(2)</ref> [of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>].

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.98in">It is also important to have in mind the role of a judgment given after trial. The primary function of a first instance judge is to find facts and identify the crucial legal points and to advance reasons for deciding them in a particular way. He should give his reasons in sufficient detail to show the parties and, if need be, the Court of Appeal the principles on which he has acted and the reasons that have led him to his decision. They need not be elaborate. There is no duty on a judge, in giving his reasons, to deal with every argument presented by counsel in support of his case. His function is to reach conclusions and give reasons to support his view, not to spell out every matter as if summing up to a jury. Nor need he deal at any length with matters that are not disputed. It is sufficient if what he says shows the basis on which he has acted.&#8221;</p>

Paragraph 16 of PD12J requires the court to determine as soon as possible whether it is necessary to conduct a fact-finding hearing in order to provide a factual basis for any of the welfare reports or assessment of risks which will be undertaken.  And going through, having considered that, it must then, under para.19, give directions as to how the proceedings are to be conducted.  Further, within the direction, as will become necessary to look at later, para.28 then gives guidance as to how the fact-finding hearing (if required) should be conducted.</p>

In fact though, whether or not The Women&#8217;s Organisation had raised the matter, there is a duty imposed on the court by, in combination, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17" uk:canonical="2021 c. 17" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Domestic Abuse Act 2021</ref> and the effect of Part 3A and PD3AA.

So by that recital, he might be taken to have had it in his mind during the hearing.  I further note that by the time of the hearing on 20 December 2021, there was a witness statement from an earlier date, in October 2021, which I have been told, and accept, was before the judge at the December hearing, in which the appellant had set out in terms not only the allegations on which she would be relying but also had set out the effect which she said, being asked to describe, at an earlier  case management hearing before a different judge the abuse on which she relied and of which she complained. She set out how describing it without the benefit of special measures had had an adverse effect on her.

He says that she has trawled the internet so as to see what she needs to say to achieve the desired effect.  He says that she was at the hearing under appeal represented through counsel and that there was no request made from counsel, or attempt made by counsel, to ask for special measures or anything of the sort, including, says the respondent, when it was discovered, as is now said, that special measures required and agreed had not been put in place.

It is also plain, on the face of the judgment, that the judge sat late to deliver an <span style="font-style:italic">ex tempore</span> judgment, having had at the start of the day to deal with various preliminary applications, as I will come on to.  He expresses himself within that judgment as being unable to cover as much of the background detail in the judgment as he might have wished to had he been delivering it earlier in the day or had he had the opportunity I have had to go back and read the papers in this appeal and to deliver an oral judgment on another day.  I keep in my mind the well-rehearsed authorities that a judge need not say everything.  There is also a very strong flavour running through the judgment that the judge was very aware of the need to avoid delay in decisions for the child; a child in respect of whom the Children&#8217;s Guardian was supportive of the application made by the father.</p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.98in">&#8220;The first application was for the matter to be retracked to comply with PD12J, namely seeking a fact-finding hearing.  The court applied PD12J, including but not limited to paragraph 5 and 17.  The court considered that any concerns of DJ Todd at an earlier hearing must have been abated as a fact-finding hearing was not directed.  The matter was also raised in the mother&#8217;s appeal, dated 30 July 2020, at Ground 2 and, as such, the appeal was dismissed on the merits on 11 September 2020 by HHJ Forester.  The court considered that notwithstanding the allegations of domestic abuse, a fact-finding hearing is not necessary or proportionate because of the extent of the relevance of those allegations to the matters the court is determining today and because of the content of the welfare reports of the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  The views of the Children&#8217;s Guardian, as expressed in her analysis, are that the allegations are mainly historic and the allegations do not prevent safe arrangements for the child being made whilst keeping contact between the parents to the minimum.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The reference there to DJ Todd was a reference to a hearing on 24 November 2020, at which the appellant had raised allegations of domestically abusive and violent behaviour within her statement as part of case management.  The judge on that occasion had heard from the appellant, so I have been told at this hearing, a description of the allegations made so as to be able to case manage them.  Although it is right to say that the order from that hearing does not reflect that they have been so considered or, indeed, that the learned judge heard from them in that way.  I have already considered that under the heading of Ground 1.</p>

As it turns out, I am satisfied that he was wrong to take that view but it does not, as I see it, matter because there is a continuing obligation to keep those matters under review by the trial judge himself, HHJ Dodd, and he had also case managed the case at earlier hearings.  I note in particular that within the case management order of 7 July 2021, HHJ Dodd does not report that any consideration was given to PD12J or to <span style="font-style:italic">H-N &amp; Ors</span>.  That case management hearing must have been directed to consider the  hearing at the end of September that was later vacated.</p>

The judgment had been handed down a little more than three months before the 7 July hearing and had attracted significant attention, unsurprisingly, both amongst the profession and the judiciary. So its omission from the recorded thinking of HHJ Dodd on 7 July 2021 is surprising even within a busy court.</p>

But whilst again that provides some sympathy for the situation the judge finds himself in, it does not relieve him, I regret to say, of the obligation to give consideration to PD12J, not just at the earliest opportunity but to keep the matter under review throughout the court process, and explicitly by PD12J s.14, to make it clear in his order that he has done so.</p>

The effect of the case management is there has not been a fact-finding on the allegations of domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour as alleged and neither, at case management by HHJ Dodd, has there been a consideration of whether there should be such a hearing.  </p>

PD12J s.17 directs the court that in determining whether a fact-finding hearing is necessary, a court must consider, amongst other things, whether the nature and extent of the allegations, if proved, would be relevant to the issues before the court.  I cannot see anywhere here the court&#8217;s consideration of this or an explanation of any conclusions reached.  The closest that it comes to is the reliance on the views of the Children&#8217;s Guardian, as expressed in her analysis, that the allegations are mainly &#8216;historic&#8217; and that they do not prevent self-arrangements for the child being made, which, as I will come onto, I regard with some disquiet also.</p>

When I look at this case, and I reflect that the court should be considering, per 36, any harm which the child, as a victim of domestic abuse, and the parent with whom the child is living has suffered as a consequence of that domestic abuse and (b) which the child and the parent with whom he is living is at risk of suffering if a child arrangements order is made.  The court is directed that it should make an order for contact only if it is satisfied that the physical and emotional safety of the child and the parent with whom the child is living can, as far as possible, be secured before, during and after contact, and the parent will not be subjected to further abuse.</p>

Once again a judge operating under pressure of time might be able to set out only in short form that analysis but it is unfortunate that it is absent here.   Nor do I see the learned judge considering those matters to which his attention is drawn by s.37 below, including, for example, in every case where a finding or an admission of domestic abuse is made or where domestic abuse is otherwise established, the court should consider the conduct of both parents towards each other, towards the child and the impact of the same, including particularly the effect of domestic abuse on the child and arrangements for where the child is living or its effect on the child&#8217;s relationship with the parents.  </p>

We agree and it follows that consideration of whether the evidence establishes an abusive pattern of coercive and/or controlling behaviour is likely to be the primary question in many cases where there is an allegation of domestic abuse, irrespective of whether there are other more specific factual allegations to be determined. The principal relevance of conducting a fact-finding hearing and in establishing whether there is, or has been, such a pattern of behaviour, is because of the impact that such a finding may have on the assessment of any risk involved in continuing contact.&#8221;</p>

In like manner, the approach of regarding coercive or controlling incidents that occurred between the adults when they were together in a close relationship as being 'in the past', and therefore of little or no relevance in terms of establishing a risk of future harm, should, we believe, also be considered to be 'old fashioned' and no longer acceptable. The fact that there may in the future be no longer any risk of assault, because an injunction has been granted, or that the opportunity for inter-marital or inter-partnership rape may no longer arise, does not mean that a pattern of coercive or controlling behaviour of that nature, adopted by one partner towards another, where this is proved, will not manifest itself in some other, albeit more subtle, manner so as to cause further harm or otherwise suborn the independence of the victim in the future and impact upon the welfare of the children of the family.&#8221;</p>
