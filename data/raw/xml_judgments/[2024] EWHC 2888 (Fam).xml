Mrs O was born in Nigeria in 1972 but moved to live in the UK with her family in about 1978. In later years, she spent time in other countries for work, including in the USA, but returned to settle in Nigeria in about 2013, when she married Mr H.  The evidence suggests the applicant has retained substantial connections with Nigeria throughout her life even if she has spent periods of time away from her home country.  She says:</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">The expert evidence prepared for this case appears to me to have assumed that this court was required to examine the process followed by the Nigerian Court in order to ask itself whether the High Court is satisfied that the Nigerian Court was entitled to make the order that it made, based on the evidence that was before the foreign court at that hearing.  Thus, in effect, the expert invited the High Court to look carefully at the process followed by the foreign court as opposed to just focusing on whether the outcome of that process created an effective order within that overseas jurisdiction.  It seems to me that this approach has four drawbacks.  First, the High Court will not necessarily know what evidence was led before the foreign court.  Secondly, unless a detailed judgment is given, it may be unclear what evidence was accepted and what evidence was rejected by the foreign court or the reasons that the court came to its decisions.  Thirdly, it may be unclear whether, and to what extent, the foreign court legitimately decided to waive any procedural requirement under the law of that country (assuming it was able to do so).  Finally, if the focus is on comity of respect, it appears disrespectful for a UK court to pick over the details of the process followed by a foreign court in coming to its decision and, in effect, express a view as to whether the foreign court was entitled to reach the decision that it did.  Finally, even if the High Court were to have reservations about whether the foreign order ought to have been made, if the High Court reaches the decision that the order was made and was legally effective in the foreign jurisdiction, any reservations could only suggest the order would be potentially voidable if it were to be challenged.  Any reservations may not justify a decision that the order should be treated as being void <span style="font-style:italic">ab initio</span> because, at least under the law of this Court, orders made by courts take effect until set aside, even if there are procedural questions as to whether the order ought to have been made: see for example <span style="font-style:italic">R (on the application of Majera (formerly SM (Rwanda)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span>  [2021] UKSC 46.  As a matter of principle, I would therefore have been surprised if the approach taken by the expert was the proper approach.  </p>

The federal government has passed a Child Rights Act 2003 and that some Nigerian states have adopted that statute to govern their own procedures.  This adoption order was made in Ogun State which has its own &#8220;Adoption Law of Ogun State 2006&#8221;, and thus adoptions in Ogun state are governed by that law and not by the Child Rights Act 2003.</p>

This court does not know precisely what evidence was before the Nigerian Court and, unless there is a full written judgment setting out the reasons of the Nigerian Court, cannot know what intellectual process was followed by that court in making its adoption decision.  If there is any suggestion that the adoption order was obtained for an improper purpose or was fraudulently obtained, this court will not recognise the adoption order.  However, it will do so by applying the fourth test not the second test.  That fourth tests provides a residual power for the court here to prevent the adoption being recognised in the UK notwithstanding that the adoption order in Nigeria was legally effective:  see <span style="font-style:italic">Re N </span>at paragraph 129.

Given she had an address in the state, the extent of her residence there was a matter for the court in Ogun state, not for this court.

I also cannot accept that it was not open to the Court in Nigeria to be satisfied that A had been abandoned.  It appears clear that, from her birth, X never took an active part in parenting A because of his drug and mental health problems.  Thus, A was left in <span style="font-family:Garamond">Y&#8217;s sole &#8220;care&#8221; from birth because she was abandoned by her father.  Parents have parental responsibilities to their children and &#8220;abandonment&#8221; in this context must mean the act of giving up those parental responsibilities and leaving the parenting to others, including the other parent.  Applying this approach, the only inference from the evidence is that X abandoned his child from birth.  The fact that he was prepared to confirm his failure to provide parenting to A by signing a guardianship in favour of other members of his family and then agreeing to an adoption cannot change the fact that he never provided any parenting to her because he was leaving it to others to carry out his parental responsibilities.  In my judgment it is plain that it was open to the court in Ogun state to conclude that A had been abandoned by both parents and made its ruling on the basis of that conclusion.  In any event, I am unable to carry out any meaningful analysis as to how or why the court in Ogun state came to that conclusion but the order was, as the Child Study Report makes clear, made on the basis of abandonment and that is a proper ground under the relevant law.</span></p>
