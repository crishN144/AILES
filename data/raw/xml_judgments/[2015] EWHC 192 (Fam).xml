	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in">The application before me concerns Herr B, Mrs B and a Form A. The first (and it might have been the last) question I have to decide is whether the Form A dated 11 March 2014 and issued on behalf of Herr B in the Slough County Court (before the Family Court was constituted) validly seises that court with competent power to make an application for a financial order: specifically an order varying a periodical payments order. The question arises because on 16 May 2014 solicitors acting for Mrs B applied to the court by way of primary relief for an order striking out the Form A for want of jurisdiction. Their application notice frames it more compendiously and on alternative bases: but at the hearing the foremost issue was recognised to be whether the process adopted by Herr B engages or fails to engage the court. That application was on 23 July 2014 transferred for hearing in the High Court and 8 and 9 December were on 31 July 2014 fixed for that hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in">In the light of their matrimonial history it seems more than usually artificial and inappropriate to refer to these parties as what in judgments such as these in conventional style are described as 'the husband' and 'the wife.' Herr B was born in Germany and Mrs B in America. He remained a German national and she has dual English and American nationality. They married first in America in December 1966. During part of their first marriage they lived in England, and their first divorce took place here in 1974. But it did not last, cohabitation resumed after some few months, and they remarried (again in America) in 1979. In 1997 (or according to German court documents dating their separation from 1994: but the discrepancy is of no consequence) their second marriage fell into disarray. In November 2000 they divorced again, this time in Germany. They have since lived apart, Herr B remarried in 2001 or thereabouts, and Mrs B still has as her companion (I choose a neutral word) the same gentleman whom she met (according to her) in 2002. They have two children, both adult. Herr B is now 78 and Mrs B is 70 years old.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in">Mrs B would have had good reason to be surprised and perplexed some weeks after the initiation of this procedure when she received as first wind of it, out of the blue, a letter dated 2 April 2014 from Stowe Family Law, solicitors acting for Herr B, who had never previously been in communication with her which notified her that the court had given standard directions in Form C requiring her to file by 2 June the compendious form of financial statement (Form E) giving full details of her property and income, in advance of a First Appointment fixed for hearing before a judge in Slough on 7 July. She was sent a copy of the Form C but was not then or previously served with the initiating Form A by Herr B's solicitors or, so it would seem, by the court as FPR rule 9.12(1) or (2) require.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in"> On 29 April 2014 Penningtons Manches, having come on record to act for Mrs B, sent a considered letter suggesting reasons why Herr B should withdraw his Form A application and explaining that failing that they would themselves apply to dispose of it by striking it out, or to dismiss it for want of jurisdiction, or as an abuse of the court's process. Herr B did not and they did. And so here we are more than seven months, over 150 pages of written evidence (including exhibits and translations), about 40 pages of correspondence and of the order of &#163;110,000 of costs expended from first to last in total on both sides, inclusive of VAT.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in">This gives notice of Herr B's intention to proceed with an application for a financial order, namely an application to vary a periodical payments order. A 'financial order' is defined within the interpretation provisions of rule 2.3 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (the FPR). Leaving aside for the moment 'a variation order,' each of the orders there specified is an order to make which specific jurisdiction exists under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> (or equivalent forms of relief in the case of applications under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33" uk:canonical="2004 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Civil Partnership Act 2004</ref>). These include a pension sharing order. A variation order and a pension sharing order for their part are defined in rule 9.3 but again, and specifically, mean such orders made 'in proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>' (or 'in proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33" uk:canonical="2004 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2004 Act</ref>' : I will hereafter for simplicity's sake make no  further reference to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33" uk:canonical="2004 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2004 Act</ref> or to its broadly corresponding provisions). </p>

Section 31(1) applies to the orders specified in section 31(2) which include (amongst others) periodical payments and secured periodical payments orders but only (as the opening words of sub-section (1) require) 'where the court has made an order' to which the section applies.</p>

And the power to make orders such as for periodical payments and secure periodical payments and pension-sharing in turn presupposes proceedings conducted in accordance with the same Act in England and Wales for divorce (or nullity) which have reached finality, that is to say in the case of divorce when the decree is made absolute and the marriage is terminated. (An exception to this prerequisite occurs when application is made with leave for financial remedies after foreign decree, under Part III of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref>, not relevant for present purposes.)</p>

They apparently resumed cohabitation within months. The second marriage would have put an end to the efficacy of any orders for continuing provision and would have started time running again (as it were) against the eventuality that in subsequent divorce proceedings an appropriate court might make such orders within its domestic jurisdiction and powers as might be appropriate if the parties themselves failed to regulate their financial position by agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in"> The Leverkusen Court divorced the parties in proceedings instituted by Herr B on the basis that their admitted separation of more than two years' duration and Mrs B's consent to a divorce demonstrated irretrievable breakdown and thus grounds for divorce pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref>(d) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>. Although in this case I have no evidence of German law, it is apparent from the status order made on 29 November 2000 that the German court applied its own domestic rules in treating English law as applicable on the basis that England was the country of last joint residence and the country where Mrs B remained ordinarily resident.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in">When however the Court's consideration turned to financial matters it made orders which it was empowered to make under German domestic law in relation to the maintenance of Mrs B and the significantly large pension entitlements of Herr B which, having retired and reached retirement age, he then enjoyed from two of his former employers. Herr B makes the somewhat surprising suggestion that Germany was chosen as the forum for their second divorce because it was approximately equidistant between what he describes as his 'primary base' in Switzerland at the time, and her address at the former matrimonial home in England. What on the face of it would have made a German court a much more obvious choice would have been its ability to make the orders in relation to Herr B's pensions upon which they were agreed: but that is supposition and is not germane, at least not at this stage of the discussion.</p>

	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in">The Court in its orders of that day recognised the parties' agreement that German law should apply to the consequences of divorce 'set out below,' namely its financial consequences. No orders of a capital nature were made to reflect increases in asset value (<span style="font-style:italic">Zugewinn</span>) during the marriage as would normally have been the case in a country which, as I understand it, operates a system based on matrimonial acquest: for the good reason that the parties waived such a claim. Mrs B suggested in her evidence that this was because, according to her husband's representations to her, they had already satisfactorily divided up the assets in their ownership. This recital in the order does however suggest to me that the German court regarded itself as entitled if not indeed obliged to apply a domestic law approach to the financial consequences of this divorce.</p>

	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in">Next, the order recites an undertaking on the part of Herr B to pay Mrs B half of the two company pensions in question, and his assignment of that proportion of his pensions to her. (There were provisions relating to tax which, although they gave rise to confusion and conflict at a later stage, are not relevant for present purposes.) That was to be the r&#233;gime for maintenance provision during the lifetime of Herr B. But the ingenious twist in what was agreed (and which would work to his advantage without detriment to her) was that the order then went on to provide that should he predecease her then that 50% provision should become the subject of what (in translation) is described as a 'pension-splitting settlement'. Thus were she to die first the life-time maintenance arrangement would obviously cease, but he thereafter would have the benefit of 100% of his pensions; whereas were he to die first she would become as it were beneficially entitled to continue to receive 50% direct from the pension providers.</p>

	      </authorialNote> has come to my attention. In each of the cases under scrutiny a German court had reached conclusions as to the appropriate domestic court by which a Maintenance Regulation application should be determined, by reference to German domestic regulations governing such questions. These German rules were intended to centralise jurisdiction, and the courts competent thereunder (the Appeal Courts) were accordingly less localised than those (far more numerous) for which article 3(b) of the Maintenance Regulation provided. The question raised in each case was whether the domestic provision contravened the requirements of the Maintenance Regulation; and the issue therefore raised at [15] was 'if Article 3(a) and (b) [are] in fact to govern both international jurisdiction and territorial jurisdiction, the Member States would be prohibited from adopting rules on venue which deviate from those laid down in the Regulation.'</p>

With all the deference that is due to his careful submissions I nevertheless conclude that I should not lengthen this judgement by entering into such extraneous and (while the ruling of the Supreme Court as to the scope of rule 4.4 on the appeal from <span style="font-style:italic">Vince v Wyatt</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 1 FLR 246" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 1 FLR 246</ref> is still pending) contentious areas. Nor do I intend to contend with the rival arguments fully advanced on each side as to the relevance, if any, of articles 4 and 12 of the Maintenance Regulation. Similarly the effect of the non-variability of the 7 April 2008 order is a hurdle that need only be crossed if and when raised in response to any competent modification application which Herr B may hereafter pursue. All this notwithstanding, I am very grateful to both Counsel for the erudition which went into their respective submissions. </p>
