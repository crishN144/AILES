This is necessary to protect his identity and other confidential information. I also prohibited the naming of the treating clinicians. Mr Y will need the skill and care of both the mental health and orthopaedic clinicians in the coming days and they should not be discomforted by being publicly named as they seek to care for him. There is no, or very limited, public interest in reporting this information. The reporting restriction represents the correct balance between Article 8 and 10 ECHR for now. I have, however, made it clear that the naming of the clinicians is a matter that can be revisited. </p>

He was discharged from his most recent inpatient admission in October 2021. In July 2023 Mr Y requested to be medicated with Olanzapine on discharge from his Community Treatment Order and his treating team agreed and switched his medication. Sadly his health and his engagement with secondary services began to deteriorate.</p>

He was observed to be neglectful of his personal care and presented with irritability. After admission he was seen by the mental health team and denied requiring medication for his Paranoid Schizophrenia. He denied any mental ill-health. It was reported that:</p>

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;[He] has an impairment of mind or brain in that he has a diagnosis of Paranoid Schizophrenia and is currently relapsing and psychotic. He is not able to understand the information around the operation as discussed with him by his treating teams due to his delusional beliefs that treatment is not required for his injuries. He does not believe the medical team&#8217;s rationale for why he requires the treatment and is not persuaded by his family of the need despite some expressions that he would believe them at times. Mr [Y] is able to retain information pertinent to this decision. He is not able to weigh up the risks and benefits of the surgical treatment he requires due to his delusional ideas of not requiring treatment and his poor engagement with his treating team on discussing the operation. His delusions are difficult to fully explore as, due to his psychosis, he is suspicious of people (including family and the treating team) and disengages and refuses to talk after a short time (circa 15 minutes). However, he appears paranoid about staff, irritable and hostile and does not appear to believe that he will lose function and movement in his arm should he not have the operation which appears to be a delusion. Therefore it is my opinion that he does not have capacity to refuse the treatment of his shoulder injury at this time.&#8221;</p>

He stated when he met with her that he does not believe he needs surgery to optimise the movement of his arm notwithstanding the current dislocation and fracture. He did not explain his reasons but does not believe he needs surgery. He does not believe surgery is necessary to recover functional use of the arm. Mr Y is not able to believe the opinions of the orthopaedic surgeons and therefore cannot weigh up the information to make a decision. She had no doubt he has Paranoid Schizophrenia and requires surgery and therefore his thinking is delusional. It is false. He looked objectively in pain when she spoke with him. Dr F was satisfied all practicable steps have been taken to help Mr Y obtain capacity to make this decision, as she set out in her Form COP 3. Post-surgical explanations as to the surgery would be explained to him by the surgical team and not by the mental health team. Dr F said that a letter explaining that the decision in respect of his surgery was made by the court and not family members or his treating mental health team would be of great assistance.</p>

The surgery is required to be performed under general anaesthetic to put the shoulder back into joint and to fix the fracture. The surgery is performed through a cut in the front of the shoulder. The surgery reduces but does not eliminate the risk of further shoulder surgery if the fracture does not heal. He proposes surgery on Thursday 16 November 2023.

If the treatment is not in his best interests, the court will not be able to give its consent on his behalf and it will follow that it will be lawful to withhold or withdraw it. Indeed, it will follow that it will not be lawful to give it. It also follows that (provided of course that they have acted reasonably and without negligence) the clinical team will not be in breach of any duty towards the patient if they withhold or withdraw it.&#8221;</p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that &#8220;It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless&#8221;. But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being</span>.&#8221;</p>

In an appropriate context, the patient&#8217;s history may paint a picture of who they are through their lived values, more accurately than their present day wishes. That is not to discount their wishes. Each part of the picture must be considered to focus the court, as accurately as possible, on the point of view of the subject of the proceedings.  In the context of a patient with recurrent severe psychiatric ill-health, their ordinary day-to-day existence may permit the court an understanding of who they are and what they might want with greater clarity than their recorded wishes at the moment of crisis from a hospital bed. Giving effect to Mr Y&#8217;s value of independence more effectively respects his dignity and promotes his autonomy than seeking to follow his currently expressed wishes and feelings.
