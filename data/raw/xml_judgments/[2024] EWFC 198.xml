	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">As it turned out, the parties separated in April 2017 in acrimonious circumstances. The father says he left the mother because she assaulted him in front of the child, and he realised that the relationship was not doing the child any good. The mother has a different account of what happened. No findings have been made by me in respect of such matters as I did not hear evidence about it. I take much of the above, and the history of the proceedings referred to below, from the written judgment of Her Honour Judge Harris following a hearing at the Central London Family Court on 14 June 2018, together with an order made by her following the hearing.</p>

Where there was some risk of abduction and an obvious detriment to the child if that risk were to materialise, the court had to be positively satisfied that the advantages to the child of her visiting that country outweighed the risks to her welfare which the visit would entail. The court had to investigate what real and tangible safeguards could be put in place to minimise the risk of retention and to secure the child's return if that transpired. In most cases there would be a need for the effectiveness of any suggested safeguard to be established by competent and complete expert evidence.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Regarding the PSO prohibiting the father from taking G out of the jurisdiction, Ms Diegan submitted that I should first determine whether the PSO should be discharged, applying the welfare test. If I decide to discharge the order, then there is no need to conduct the risk assessment contemplated by <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re K</span>. In the event that I do not discharge the PSO, or I decide to vary the order to deal specifically with whether the father should be permitted to take G on holiday to Pakistan or Egypt, then the assessment in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re K</span> would need to be undertaken, and would involve a consideration of the risk as against the safety measures that can be put into place. I agree with that approach and further agree with her, that in any event the welfare test itself requires me to consider any harm G is at risk of suffering if I were to discharge the PSO. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, the PSO should be discharged. The principal reason is because the father, in my judgment, poses no risk of abducting G to Pakistan, Egypt or indeed any other country. I find the suggestion that he would abduct G entirely fanciful and without a proper evidential basis to support such a contention. The mother&#8217;s position rests entirely on her belief that as the paternal grandmother (a term I shall use to describe the father&#8217;s mother) grows older, the father would feel duty bound to go and live in Pakistan with her. This may well be based on what the mother&#8217;s views are on what happens with many families, but it does not factor in the particular circumstances of the father&#8217;s family. It is, as the father suggested in evidence, based wholly on a stereotypical view of a Pakistani family. I do not think for one moment, seeing the standard of life the father has here, together with a highly paid job and a property in a wealthy part of London, that the father would give that all up to live in Pakistan. Firstly, the family have the means to ensure that the paternal grandmother is well looked after in Pakistan if she wishes to spend her remaining years there. It may mean that the father has to travel there more often than he has done in the past, but it is a huge leap to suggest he would go and live there &#8211; and abduct G to live there as well. Secondly, it is more likely that the paternal grandmother will go to live in Canada or Egypt with the father&#8217;s sisters, and steps are already underway to prepare for this possibility. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second reason for discharging the PSO is because it has been the cause of a number of bitter exchanges between the parties. As time has passed since the order was made in 2018, the father has sought the mother&#8217;s permission to take G on holiday and the mother has continually said no. I find that she was wholly resistant to the father taking G out of the UK at all, even to Hague countries. This is evidenced by the fact that a Specific Issue Order needed to be granted to allow the father to take G to France for a holiday, albeit this was eventually ordered by consent. The mother&#8217;s resistance has been the cause of more requests by the father which she has then alleged as him harassing her. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Even at this hearing, whilst the mother said that she was content for the father to travel to Hague convention countries, this was somewhat qualified, because she said she was also concerned that there could be onward travel to Pakistan or Egypt. If this PSO is retained, it will be a continual source of contention that will not be in G&#8217;s best interests. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the welfare check list, I can see from the evidence and photographs exhibited to witness statements that G enjoys being with members of her paternal family. I accept that she wants to travel with her father and will want to enjoy going on holiday with him. Not only will a time come soon that G will want to go to Pakistan or Egypt to visit the paternal family and see where her parents grew up, she will benefit enormously from doing so. I accept that she will want to celebrate family events and I consider that restrictions such as those proposed by the mother may be harmful to G. Educationally, travel will widen her understanding of the world and increase her independence. I do not believe this order will result in the father suddenly taking G on lengthy trips overseas and I accept that he will use his judgment when deciding on when and where to take G on a first trip. She has already been to France with her father and enjoyed it. I do not consider that any such change to her circumstances will have a negative effect on her. The father is fully attuned to G&#8217;s physical and emotional needs and if G was unwell at any point whilst abroad, I am in no doubt that he would know what to do. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept that there should be a stepped increase in the number of consecutive nights stay but do not accept that the proposal put forward by the mother is justified or in G&#8217;s best interests. In any event, we are talking about a difference of 2 days in 2025 and 3 days in 2026. If the court were to adopt the mother&#8217;s proposal, she would not be able to spend two weeks consecutively with either parent until 2029. The advantage of each parent having two weeks during the summer holidays is that it would allow the parent to book a holiday with G. I have considered carefully the points made by the mother concerning G&#8217;s UTI problems and her separation anxiety. Firstly, I believe that in time the UTI problems will be resolved and secondly the father is more than capable to deal with such problems as they arise. I do not consider that to be a good enough reason to reduce her stay with either parent. Further, one does not need to be an expert to know that the level of tension and hostility between the parents will play out both physically and emotionally in G. A degree of separation anxiety is understandable in these circumstances. However, as these arrangements settle down, and a better relationship is restored between the parents, the likelihood is that G&#8217;s anxiety will reduce in any event. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment my answer to this is &#8216;no&#8217; and I make no such order. I consider this stipulation to be entirely unnecessary. Firstly, I accept that the father does not have any particular plans to leave G with anyone whilst she is living with him. Secondly, if the situation arises, I accept that the father is capable of exercising his own parental judgment in such circumstances in the best interest of G. In her evidence, the mother said that she too would be happy to abide by such an order, but I consider it no more necessary for her than I do the father. I do not consider it in G&#8217;s interest to tie the parents&#8217; hands in this way. I was not persuaded during the hearing that there is any good reason for it. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having made the decisions I was asked to make, it just remains for me to make this comment which I do so as neutrally as I can. To state the obvious, whilst the parents&#8217; own relationship has long ended, they will always be parents to G and so there has to be some form of continued relationship between them that is conducive to the well-being of G. Now is the time for both parents to put historical events behind them and work hard to restore a workable relationship with each other, so that neither of them has to revert to the courts again to resolve matters. It includes both parties encouraging a good relationship with extended family too. G should not be placed in the intolerable position of being witness to this type of conflict. Everyone must put G&#8217;s interests first. </p>
