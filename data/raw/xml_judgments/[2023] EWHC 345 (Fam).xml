The appeal also challenges the judge&#8217;s decisions, firstly, to impose a restriction on further applications under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 91(14)</ref> [&#8216;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>&#8217;] and, secondly, to order the mother to pay costs.</p>

The primary assertion being made in support of the appeal is that, if the case had been approached properly, the expert who was instructed in these proceedings should never have been instructed as they were unqualified to give expert evidence on the issues raised in their instructions.</p>

It seems clear that the process adopted by the court at this time lacked necessary rigour. The order did not specify the required professional discipline of the expert as between psychology and psychiatry. It does not seem that Ms A&#8217;s CV was ever submitted to the court and the court order, presumably agreed between the parties&#8217; legal advisers, erroneously described Ms A as &#8216;Dr A&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The final hearing in February 2021 had to be adjourned after two days due to the unfortunate illness of the children&#8217;s guardian. It concluded in June 2021. In a full and closely reasoned judgment, delivered on 24 June, the judge, firstly, gave her own analysis of the extensive oral evidence given by the two parents. The judge concluded that the mother&#8217;s evidence was neither reliable nor credible, in contrast to that of the father, and the judge made a number of significant adverse findings about the mother&#8217;s behaviour in the context of potential alienation. Secondly, the judge weighed up, and ultimately accepted, Ms A&#8217;s conclusion that both children had been influenced and encouraged by their mother to think very negatively of their father and that this had caused significant emotional damage to them. Thirdly, the judge accepted the children&#8217;s guardian&#8217;s own separate analysis (in part based on the CAFCASS Alienation Tool) and the guardian&#8217;s conclusion that, without significant change in the children&#8217;s negative view of their father, it would become entrenched causing long-term emotional harm. It is of particular note that the judge stated that she had found the guardian&#8217;s independent analysis &#8216;compelling&#8217;. She, therefore, made orders for both children to live with their father and, after a period of suspension to allow for settling in, contact with their mother was to develop in a structured manner.</p>

The sole focus of the expert&#8217;s instruction was to advise upon the professional and/or clinical qualifications of Ms A to undertake the assessment of adults and/or children in the manner sought by Ms A&#8217;s instructions. The expert to be instructed was Professor Wang, a clinical psychologist who is the chair of the ACP. The judge considered the application on paper, after receiving written submissions from all three parties. The judge had also seen an unsolicited email which Prof Wang had sent to the court in January 2022, in which he set out his view of the expertise of Ms A. In an order issued on 10 May, the judge concluded that it was not necessary to have Prof Wang&#8217;s expert opinion before the court when determining the application to reopen her findings. The Part 25 application was dismissed.</p>

The resources of the parties, who have been funding this litigation themselves, and the resources of the court have been taken up with this case for a significant number of years. The financial and emotional cost to the parties has been immense. Further time and cost cannot be justified. The children - who love both of their parents - will not be assisted if the case is once again reopened. The children are thriving in their schools and they now have the benefit of a relationship with both of their parents. To have another year of litigation will be damaging.</p>

The mother cannot accept any responsibility for the damage that has been done to the children over the years. The findings are, and remain, significant to the children. The findings I made have enabled the children the freedom to develop good relationships with all of their family (maternal and paternal). Any further evidence, that would be based on a new report by new expert, who would have to revisit all of the past, would not assist the children. This is not a case in which new evidence has come to light since I made my decision.</p>

It is not, however, submitted that it was inappropriate for a psychologist to be instructed in the present case; indeed the ACP case is that the expert should have been a clinical psychologist. Ms A had been selected by the guardian and put forward, erroneously, as &#8216;Dr&#8217; A. Ms Brereton told the court that a recommendation from a guardian is not often questioned. Ms A&#8217;s CV is extensively set out. The CV is a diffuse and confusing narrative of attendance at courses and other activities. It would have been hard for the parties and the court to drill down to see what her underlying qualifications were.

Practitioner psychologists who have the qualifications necessary to meet the stringent criteria for statutory regulation with the HCPC, are registered with the HCPC with one (or more) &#8216;protected&#8217; titles. The legislation protects seven titles: Clinical Psychologist, Health Psychologist, Counselling Psychologist, Educational Psychologist, Occupational Psychologist, Sport and Exercise Psychologist, and Forensic Psychologist. In addition, the two generic titles &#8211; Practitioner Psychologist and Registered Psychologist &#8211; are available to registrants who already hold one of the seven &#8216;specialist&#8217; titles. See Appendix 1 for a detailed description of protected titles.</p>

Article 39(1) of the Health Professions Order 2001 makes it a criminal offence for a person, with intent to deceive, to state that they are on the HCPC Register; to use a designated title to which they are not entitled; or to say falsely that they have qualifications as a practitioner psychologist. An unregistered person may be committing an offence even if they do not use the designated title directly, such as describing the service they provide as &#8216;clinical psychology&#8217; or &#8216;forensic psychology&#8217;.&#8217;</p>

She only had made interim arrangements, specifically to cover half-term. Removal pending determination of long-term arrangements at final hearing was only determined after the two day hearing two weeks later ..

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Hale stressed the importance and value of the three pillared approach taken by the judge in reaching her overall determination. The judge&#8217;s adverse findings against the mother stood separately from the analysis of Ms A, as did the separate evaluation made by the guardian. On the central point in the appeal, namely that Ms A was not qualified to act, Mr Hale submits that the case is fundamentally flawed due to the absence of any bright-line statement of law or regulation to that effect. The appropriateness of instructing a non-registered and/or non-regulated psychologist sits in a grey area about which there has been professional debate over recent years. The current guidance is no more than guidance; it is not the law. There was no legal prohibition preventing the instruction of Ms A and that, submitted Mr Hale, was fatal to the prospects of this appeal.</p>

Whilst in other fields of professional practice, via regulatory or disciplinary proceedings, such a finding might be made, that would only be the case after a full and fair hearing that had been properly constituted before an appropriate tribunal. The suggestion that this court, on the basis of submissions alone, and without affording any opportunity to Ms A to be heard directly, would make such a finding in the context of an appeal against a refusal to reopen findings of fact, only has to be stated for it to be seen to be wholly untenable.</p>

The judge concluded that it was not necessary for Prof Wang&#8217;s expert view to be before the court. She considered that there was a danger of the case being de-railed with time taken up by discussion of the merits and de-merits of the competing views on the manner in which assessments are to be carried out.

The evaluation can, however, be short. In most Family proceedings, the purpose of instruction is to find out what the opinion of the instructed expert is on the relevant issue(s). Here, Prof Wang had, before the question of his being instructed as an expert had been raised, volunteered his opinion on Ms A&#8217;s qualification in his January 2022 letter to the court in unequivocal terms [see para 36]. Whilst permitting him to be instructed as an expert would undoubtedly have provided chapter and verse for his shortly stated conclusion, the judge had already experienced Ms A being thoroughly cross-examined on this topic during the substantive hearing. She also had the underlying detail set out in the FJC/BPS and ACP guidance. In the circumstances, and where the judge was going to measure that cross-examination alongside recent guidance and Ms A&#8217;s CV, she was not in error in refusing leave to instruct Prof Wang. </p>

I have, nevertheless, set the ACP submissions out in some detail because they are of value in flagging up the potential for the qualifications of a candidate for instruction to fall short of what is required.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The single issue upon which the appeal is based is that relating to Ms A&#8217;s qualification to undertake the role of expert assigned to her in this case. It is correct that, since June 2021, when the fact finding judgment was given, there have been developments in terms of guidance which focus upon the need for caution when instructing experts in Family proceedings. Reference has been made to the ACP guidance, and the FJC/BPS guidance, and to the President&#8217;s Memorandum, to which reference was made in a speech in Jersey. This new material is important and should be read and understood by professionals and judiciary in the Family Court, but it is no more than guidance or advice. It is neither black-letter law nor regulation, and it does not, of itself, render unlawful that which was previously accepted, or, more particularly, render &#8216;unqualified&#8217; an individual who was previously thought to be qualified to act as an expert.</p>

I have already held that the judge was correct not to admit Prof Wang&#8217;s letter as evidence and was right not to permit his instruction as an expert. In her judgment refusing permission to instruct Prof Wang, the judge had not identified his letter as one of the factors to be taken into account when hearing the substantive application to reopen the factual conclusions, and it can be seen that she did not do so. The judge was plainly correct in taking that course. The unsolicited letter from Prof Wang was not evidence and the court had refused permission for him to be instructed as an expert. Indeed, in those circumstances, if the judge had placed reliance upon the letter as part of her decision it would have been vulnerable to a charge of abuse of process.</p>

Without being prescriptive, the primary focus of the word &#8216;information&#8217; in the context of an application to reopen a factual determination must relate to factual information that, whilst not, at that stage, formal &#8216;evidence&#8217;, casts doubt upon the previously found facts, for example a police log or a mobile phone record. A letter restating an assertion that had been four-square before the court at the original hearing, namely that Ms A was not qualified, no matter how apparently authoritative the source may be, is not of the same quality as fresh factual information. It is an opinion. In addition, Hale J&#8217;s formulation is descriptive as opposed to prescriptive; a court is not obliged to take account of every piece of new &#8216;information&#8217;, but may do so. In the circumstances, reference to &#8216;information&#8217; in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span> does not take the Appellant&#8217;s case any further.</p>

In the absence of some bright-line provision which, without debate and unambiguously, establishes that Ms A was not qualified to undertake instruction as the psychological expert in these proceedings, this appeal process is simply inapt to determine the issue. It would be neither possible nor, indeed, fair, for the court effectively to determine Ms A&#8217;s fitness to practice as she has been doing for some years by trial by submission alone.</p>

This point was, rightly, not pursued in detail. By the time of the hearing before the judge, which is the focus of the appeal, the guardian&#8217;s position was plainly against re-opening. In this court the guardian opposes the appeal. Any indication of earlier, shortly stated, concern must therefore be of little weight and cannot save the appellant&#8217;s case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was, however, so clear that the appeal should be dismissed not solely because of the negative conclusion that I had formed about the proposed assault on Ms A&#8217;s qualification. In any appeal of this nature, it is necessary for the court not only to keep in focus the specific criticisms that are being made of the judge below, but also to maintain the whole of the original fact-finding judgment in view at all times. The primary focus is on the decision whether or not to reopen the fact finding decision, consideration of Ms A&#8217;s qualifications is but one part of the overall determination. From that perspective, the appellant, even if the case against Ms A had proceeded further, would have had an uphill task. The June 2021 judgment was a full and thorough judgment from a most experienced Family judge, who had been immersed in the case over a number of hearings and, at the trial, over a number of days. An appellate court will always, rightly and necessarily, afford significant respect to findings of fact made by a judge who has been exposed to the key lay parties, and to the totality of the evidence, in the cockpit of a fully contested hearing. That judge has a perspective and insight into a case which is of a wholly different order to that of the appellate court. HHJ Davies made clear and firm adverse findings as to the mother&#8217;s credibility and her detailed evidence. These findings were the judge&#8217;s own findings, based on the written and oral evidence of the parties. They were free-standing findings and not based upon the analysis and conclusions of either Ms A or the guardian. Separately, the guardian had come to her own conclusions as to the welfare outcome for the children. Whilst there would plainly be potential for the guardian&#8217;s conclusion to be influenced by the evidence of an expert, the judge was satisfied that this, too, was a free-standing evaluation. Ms A's evidence was a third element in the judicial decision making; it was compatible with the first two, but not more influential than that.</p>

This appeal has come to the court to allow the wider issues to be considered, by reference to Ms A&#8217;s role in this case.

On 1 July 2022 we wrote to the Director of Workforce at the Department of Health and Social Care to highlight the risks presented by unregulated psychologists including in relation to the provision by them of expert evidence in court proceedings.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Courts faced with a potential expert who presents a voluble, unstructured CV should at all times bear in mind that there is clear and solid ground to be found in the registration scheme. A lesson plainly to be drawn from the present case is the need for clarity as to an expert&#8217;s qualification and/or experience. The more diffuse and unstructured a CV, the less effective it is likely to be in transmitting information crisply and clearly. In this regard, lawyers, magistrates and judges are lay readers. They need to be able to see with clarity, and in short form, the underlying basis for an individual&#8217;s expertise. HCPC registration, or chartered status in the BPS, provide a reliable, one-stop, method of authentication. Where a potential expert is registered with the HCPC as entitled to hold themselves out as an expert under one of the protected titles, this can be taken as sufficient qualification to offer an opinion within that field of practice. Further detail in the CV may assist with the choice of one particular expert over another, but it is the kitemark of HCPC registration which should resolve the question of qualification without more. A psychologist&#8217;s CV should, therefore, prominently highlight whether they are HCPC registered or not. It is incumbent on an un-registered psychologist to assist the court by providing a short and clear statement of their expertise.</p>

The description of the three-tier structure in counsel&#8217;s submissions was necessarily summarised and requires further evaluation and explanation before it may be taken further by courts, but, if it is correct that publishers do restrict access to a range of valuable tools to those with HCPC registration, this can only enhance the need for the court to understand whether a potential expert is, or is not, registered. I am going to invite the FJC to investigate this issue and consider revising its guidance to include reference to this factor if that is justified.</p>

A psychiatrist is a doctor who is a specialist in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness, whereas a psychologist&#8217;s skill is in assessing personality, intellectual functioning and behaviour.

The aim of the template will be for readers to see at a glance whether an individual is currently registered with the HCPC (and if so in what category), or a Chartered Psychologist, or not. Further information, displayed shortly and clearly, should identify any formal qualifications, posts held and published work. If, on investigation by the FJC, the three-tier structure controlled by the publishers of assessment tools is seen as a valid indicator, that too should be included. Such a template might include some easily understood &#8216;traffic-light&#8217; indication of expertise. A template of this nature would, I believe, greatly assist courts in divining the basic level of expertise of a potential expert witness. It would remain open to the court to instruct any person who it considers is capable of discharging the expert role in each case, but, particularly where a proposed psychological expert is un-registered, the court should be on notice to the need to look more carefully at the underlying evidence of appropriate expertise.</p>

For these purposes, the ACP-UK wishes to emphasise that &#8220;parental alienation&#8221; is not a syndrome capable of being diagnosed, but a process of manipulation of children perpetrated by one parent against the other through, what are termed as, &#8220;alienating behaviours&#8221;.

Most Family judges have, for some time, regarded the label of &#8216;parental alienation&#8217;, and the suggestion that there may be a diagnosable syndrome of that name, as being unhelpful. What is important, as with domestic abuse, is the particular <span style="font-style:italic">behaviour</span> that is found to have taken place within the individual family before the court, and the <span style="font-style:italic">impact</span> that that behaviour may have had <span style="font-style:italic">on the relationship </span>of a child with either or both of his/her parents. In this regard, the identification of &#8216;alienating behaviour&#8217; should be the court&#8217;s focus, rather than any quest to determine whether the label &#8216;parental alienation&#8217; can be applied.</p>

In circumstances where the first appeal had failed on the basis that it was &#8216;totally without merit&#8217;, and a second attempt to overturn the findings of fact based largely upon subsequent guidance, rather than anything of more substance, had failed, the judge was fully entitled to hold that the mother&#8217;s conduct was not reasonable. Whether those words were used in the substantive judgment or not, the reality is that the application to reopen did not enjoy any prospect of success. In terms of proportionality, it is relevant that this was the first occasion on which the father had sought costs. Whilst the cumulative impact of the judge&#8217;s findings and orders will have been a substantial blow to the mother, by failing, without good reason (as Peel J, HHJ Davies and I have now held), to accept those findings but instead seek to overturn them, she had brought the making of those orders upon herself.</p>
