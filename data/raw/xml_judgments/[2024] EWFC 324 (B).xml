Sadly, some of the information that she was given in relation to her parents, namely the fact that they were in prison, appeared to have a destabilising effect on N, and, although support was offered, that was not sufficient to stop the placement breaking down, and that has led to the separation of the three girls.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The proposal is that the children will have monthly sibling contact.  The social worker rightly emphasised in her very helpful and nuanced statement the importance which the Local Authority attaches to sibling contact in this case.  I entirely endorse that.  It seems to me that, although there have been issues with the children living in one placement which have led to separation, the evidence is that the sibling bond can be successfully nurtured, and that that can be done through sibling contact.</p>

Having regard to the terms of s.1 of the Children Act 1989, when deciding whether to terminate a father's parental responsibility, the child's welfare is the court's paramount consideration (that question being a question with respect to the upbringing of a child pursuant to s.105(1) of the Act) but is not required to consider the factors set out in s.1(3) of the 1989 Act, as an order terminating the father's parental responsibility is not an order specified in s.1(4) of the 1989 Act.

By s 1(4), there is no requirement upon the court to consider the factors set out in s 1(3) (the "welfare checklist") but the court is not prevented from doing so and may find it helpful to use an analytical framework not least because welfare has to be considered and reasoned.  Given that the cessation of parental responsibility is an order of the court, the court must also consider whether making such an order is better for the child than making no order at all (the "no order" principle in s 1(5) of the CA 1989)'.</p>

Accordingly, factors that may be said to have significance by analogy or on the facts of a particular case, for example, the factors that the court considers within the overarching question of welfare upon an application for a parental responsibility order (the degree of commitment which the father has shown to the child, the degree of attachment which exists between the father and the child and the reasons of the father for applying for the order) may be relevant on the facts of a particular case but are not to be taken to be a substitute test to be applied (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Parental Responsibility Order)</span> [2013] EWCA Civ 969, [2014] 1 FLR 339, at paras [15] and [16]).</p>

He obtains it in accordance with the statutory scheme and may lose it in the same way.  In both circumstances it is the welfare of the child that creates the presumption, not the parenthood of the unmarried father.  The concept of rival presumptions is not helpful, although I entirely accept that the fact of parenthood raises the welfare question, hence the right of a parent (with or without parental responsibility) to make an application under s 8 of the CA 1989 without permission (see s 10(4)(a) of the CA 1989).  There is also ample case-law describing the imperative in favour of a continuing relationship between both parents and a child so that ordinarily a child's upbringing should be provided by both of his parents and where that is not in the child's interests by one of them with the child having the benefit of a meaningful relationship with both.  A judge would not be criticised for identifying that, as a very weighty, relevant factor, the significance of the parenthood of an unmarried father should not be under estimated'.</p>

By stressing the "responsibility" which is so clearly given prominence in the Children Act 1989, section 3 and the likely circumstance that that responsibility is shared with the other parent, it is hoped that some parents may be encouraged more readily to engage with the difficulties that undoubtedly arise when contemplating post separation contact than may hitherto been the case'."</p>

It would be possible to formulate prohibited steps or specific issue orders that &#8216;ring fenced&#8217; elements of the exercise of PR. In my view there are two reasons why that is not the welfare solution that best meets EMP&#8217;s needs at present. First, on consideration of the day-to-day elements of PR that remain to be exercised it is difficult to identify what should be left or what may raise itself as an issue in the future. Secondly, and more importantly, in this case the &#8216;representative&#8217; value of having PR is in my view significant. PR is important not just for the practical &#8216;rights and responsibilities&#8217; it manifests but also because of its intangible quality as a statement of those rights and responsibilities. From the mother&#8217;s (and I am sure in due course the child&#8217;s) perspective it is difficult to ignore the fact that however &#8216;ring fenced&#8217; or restricted, the father retaining PR represents an individual who has raped her retaining a legally recognised statement of his ability to involve himself and be consulted regarding the child. I fail to see how in the circumstances of this case that is a proportionate outcome.&#8221;</p>

By section 1(4), there is no requirement upon the court to consider the factors set out in section 1(3) (the 'welfare checklist') but the court is not prevented from doing so and may find it helpful to use an analytical framework not least because welfare has to be considered and reasoned.  Given that the cessation of parental responsibility is an order of the court, the court must also consider whether making such an order is better for the child than making no order at all (the 'no order' principle in s 1(5) of the Children Act 1989)."</p>

Their father has caused the gravest emotional harm to them by killing the mother.  In so doing, he has deprived them of her care throughout what remains of their childhood and into adulthood.  Whilst the younger children have been told that their father hurt their mother so that she died, the details of what occurred are not yet known to them.  P knows more of what took place but his knowledge remains incomplete for the moment.  In due course, all three children will learn what is known by the authorities as to the circumstances in which the mother died.  Coming to terms with that information will place a significant emotional and psychological burden on these children.  This is not just because of the circumstances of the mother&#8217;s death but also because the man all three love - their father - was responsible.

Protecting the children for a few years might give stability to P for example but thereafter would expose the younger children - at the start of or on the cusp of adolescence with its attendant emotional and psychological changes - to the profoundly destabilising effect of further applications at a time when they would be particularly vulnerable."</p>

Undoubtedly it would be an exacerbating factor in terms of the children's emotional safety if they were to go into the prison, which is likely to make them feel unsafe.  They key issue, however, is the emotional impact on them of being expected to engage with the father, as a father, in a normal way, whilst processing the hugely challenging information that he has sexually abused their sister, and at a very grave level.</p>

The children might have questions for F himself and, given his denial of the offences, it is simply impossible to see how that could be managed.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Finally, the application under section 91(14) Children Act 1989 also falls to be considered under the heading of harm.  In this regard I found the submissions of Mr McCall very helpful.  He submitted that the present case, like the case before Knowles J, contains the most serious offences against a family member of the children, in that case the murder of the mother, in this case heinous sexual abuse of a sibling.  He submitted that the court should consider the destabilising effect which any application &#8211; for example an application for contact - may have upon the children throughout their childhoods.</p>

Her early experiences have significantly compromised her ability to act in a self-protective way and to recognise and remove herself from people and relationships that were harmful.  She loves her children dearly, however her ability to meet the children's physical needs has been adversely affected by the dynamics of the relationship with F.  She does not have a good understanding of her own or her children's emotional needs.  Her understanding of safeguarding regarding sexual abuse is very limited.  Whilst she acknowledges that domestic abuse is not good for children, her ability to prioritise the children's needs is impaired because of her altered perception of what is acceptable within a relationship.  She has also viewed the children at times as her protectors, indicating an unhealthy reversal of protective roles within the family."</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The children are facing a long journey of coming to terms with what has happened to them against the background of their already vulnerable position as a result of the harm which had already been caused to them by their parenting.  There is, in my judgment, considerable scope for applications to destabilise the children if made without the filter of section 91(14).</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I do consider that it is likely, and I note that in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v F &amp; Others</span> [2022] EWFC 127, Knowles J considered it inevitable, that the children would need to be told of applications if made without the section 91 (14) filter.  As I mentioned, the eldest of F's children is nearly 10.  Unless F was to make an application in very early course, any application that he might be considering making might be when she is 11, 12, 13.  At those ages, it seems to me it would be inevitable that the child would need to be told.  With a mixed-age sibling group, even when they are not living together, given that they will be having extensive contact, there is clearly considerable scope for one child knowing of the application to lead to another child knowing.  Of course, LX and N are only a year and two years younger than L, so the considerations apply equally to them.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In short, the children's ages, it seems to me, are such that it is likely that they will need to be told about any substantive application, and there is the risk therefore that they will be disturbed by it and any progress put back by an application.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have already raised in discussion with Mr McCall that the leave filter is a flexible one, and it may be that the court in receiving an application from F considers it is hopeless and deals with it on paper; however it could also be that the court, even at the leave stage, calls for statements from the Local Authority, appoints a Guardian, and permits position statements from all parties.  Those are all possible responses to a leave application.  There is a flexibility as to how that would be approached.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">But once leave is granted, it seems to me that the children are going to become aware of it.  So, that is the difference, and it does seem to me therefore that there is a distinct and very clear welfare benefit to making the 91(14) order.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Dealing finally with the period of the section 91(14) direction, the key point seems to me that it is simply too unpredictable to try to predict at what stages the children's vulnerabilities may be most apparent.  I do not think that I can simply say, for example, after three years the risk of harm which I have identified is going to disappear, or after five years it is going to disappear.  I cannot come to that conclusion, and therefore I do consider, in the same way that Knowles J did, in <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v F and Others</span> that the order should be made for the length of the children's childhood.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I do not however consider that this is a case where I need to make a direction such as that made by HHJ Baker in <span style="font-style:italic">DG v KB v EMP </span>that the application should not be served until it has been considered by the court.  The fact that the Local Authority are in the driving seat as regards to parental responsibility, and not the mother, makes it in my judgment unnecessary to put that extra level of protection in place.  Of course, if an application was to be made, the court would almost certainly want to know from the Local Authority its views of the application.  So, I do not consider that to be a necessary direction.</p>
