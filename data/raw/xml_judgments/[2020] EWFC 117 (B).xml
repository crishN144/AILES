The Local Authority is a public body with a statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of children and support of families. Where that work has resulted in Court proceedings, the Local Authority is held accountable for its actions with families by the Court. The need for a public body to be identified when acting in respect of citizens is important. However, the Court concludes in the particular circumstances of this case that naming the Local Authority would carry with it a risk of identifying the children. Having balanced the risks between transparency of justice on behalf of the State where life changing decisions are made for children, and ensuring their privacy, welfare and safeguarding needs are taken seriously and protected, the Court concludes that the public interest in identifying the applicant Local Authority is outweighed by the risk of identification of the children.</span></p>

The Local Authority was concerned that the parents appeared unable to manage the children's behaviour and aggression towards each other as siblings, particularly regarding the child, C, which resulted in the children presenting on several occasions with injuries.  </span></p>

Having regard to the interim report from the residential unit, Dr Dowd observed that there were positive comments in terms of the mother&#8217;s progress and her ability to benefit from the support and guidance she was receiving. Dr Dowd noted that, in formal settings, such as meeting with the Local Authority or healthcare professionals, the possibility of an individual with autistic difficulties being affected by sensory input, which included verbal discussions that are complex or involve multiple speakers, is an issue that should be considered, as the sensory input could well disadvantage them. Further, verbal or didactically presented information and long discussions with the mother will be more difficult for her to interact positively with. </span></p>

C presents as a child who has significant maladaptive attachment patterns that are well engrained and he becomes dysregulated very quickly. There has been an increase in the level of his dangerous behaviour which indicated that his psychological needs were not being met. His behaviour has been so aggressive as to lead to the break down two foster care placements. His presentation significantly increases the likelihood of him suffering mental health problems in his childhood, adolescence and adulthood. His behaviour makes him a moderate risk to other adults and a significant risk to his younger sibling and potentially a risk to his baby brother. Further, his negative behaviour could preoccupy his mother such that she is unable to successfully care for her younger children, which also puts them at significant risk. C&#8217;s emotional development was at risk as he internalises a belief that his mother cannot manage her own behaviour in response to him. Faced with a lack of containment, his anxiety will rise and he is likely to increase his responses attacking his mother and siblings. Some of the specific aggressive behaviour and especially swearing and particularly aggressive language is likely to have been modelled from interactions C has witnessed between his father and his mother. His aggressive and coercive behaviour towards his mother is likely not only to be a result of his attachment strategies but in combination with learnt behaviour from things he has witnessed at home. His behaviour patterns are likely primarily to be the result of his disordered attachment difficulties which have been influenced by his maladaptive early experiences, most especially aspects of neglect and witnessing domestic violence and potentially witnessing differences in caregiving between himself and his other siblings. Should such patterns of behaviour continue or increase, he will pose a risk to his mother and others around him, his development trajectory from early childhood into school age will be immediately affected and overall the prognosis for him psychologically is likely to be poor with an increased risk of mental health problems. For the mother and C, the pattern of interacting was becoming so dangerous and difficult that ultimately it would not be sustainable. </span></p>

Dr Phibbs reported that D is quite self-reliant and, although he will try to interact with others, he often gives up. Dr Phibbs was of the opinion that although his mother picks up on some of D&#8217;s language, she failed to interact with many of his attempts to communicate and is not consistently reinforcing his use of language. Dr Phibbs observed, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">I felt that [the mother] was unable to interact with [D] in an age-appropriate way and often miscalculated or misunderstood what he would be able or comfortable doing.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> Dr Phibbs observed that D&#8217;s attachment strategies towards others, most importantly towards his mother, are developing and are likely to be relatively flexible.

Dr Phibbs acknowledged that the mother&#8217;s ability to make safe choices in relation to partners and her capacity to reflect on her children&#8217;s needs in part may have been impacted negatively by her autistic traits. In her oral evidence, Dr Phibbs went on to tell the Court that the possibility the mother had autism was highlighted as early as 2016 by Dr Dowd. Dr Phibbs told the Court, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">There is a risk that the mother&#8217;s deficits in her parenting become all about autism.

Approaches should be informed by autism but it is too simple to say it is just autism. That sits alongside an already complex picture.

Through play therapy sessions, role modelling sessions and one-to-one discussion with the mother, it was reported that the mother appeared to understand the importance of giving D and E toys that stretch their imagination and allow them to use their visual, hearing and coordination skills. The assessment reported that the mother continued to attend a local children centre and engage in organised play with both D and E. It was reported that the mother learnt lessons about keeping the children safe and was able to implement that learning whilst at the centre, being able to stop D climbing the table, coming down the stairs on his own and not letting him go off with strangers. </span></p>

The community-based assessment concluded that there continued to be some positives in the mother&#8217;s parenting of D and E and that she could meet some of their basic care needs such as feeding, bathing, changing in clean, age-appropriate clothing, taking D to nursery, reading them bedtime stories, offering them shelter and providing them with age-appropriate toys. The assessment noted that the deficits identified in the previous residential assessment still remained. In particular, the concern was noted that the mother still found it difficult to be &#8216;in tune&#8217; with the children&#8217;s developmental needs.

The father was observed to display, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">with a fair degree of clarity that he has sexist views about women.

Other concerns related to A being at risk of developing mental health illness and that he was likely to develop an eating disorder possibly linked to his background of neglect. B has some speech and language difficulties although he was able to make his needs known. The Head Teacher at the school was concerned that adults need to make sure they attend to B as he is a child who can get lost in his own thoughts.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:11pt">At the conclusion of the Final Hearing in May 2019, the Court determined, having regard to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, that it was clear that the children A and B would benefit greatly from remaining in the permanent care of their maternal grandparents. Both siblings settled well and have thrived in their care. The Court found that continued placement with the maternal grandparents was in the best interests of both A and B individually and collectively. The Local Authority&#8217;s recommendation for a Child Arrangements Order was not supported. In the judgement of the Court, a Special Guardianship Order would give the children more stability and a sense of permanence, the maternal grandparents would hold an enhanced parental responsibility. Placement under a Special Guardianship Order would ensure that the children&#8217;s placement was secure with support provided under a Special Guardianship Support Plan. Accordingly, the Court made a Special Guardianship Order in respect of both children A and B, in favour of their maternal grandparents and endorsed the recommendation for the Special Guardians to support weekly contact between A, B and their mother, subject to the Special Guardians continuing to monitor the welfare needs of A and B.</span></p>

His mother and father both found it difficult to manage his behaviour. His behaviour was also difficult to manage in the residential assessment unit, with reports of C being very boisterous and aggressive towards his mother and siblings. C had several placement changes whilst in interim care as a consequence of the difficulties in managing his behaviour. Dr Phibbs concluded that C&#8217;s extreme behaviour was likely to be related to disordered attachment patterns. C had made derogatory comments to his mother and had reported that his father said these things to his mother. </span></p>

The Local Authority was concerned that it was striking that the father had given little thought to his proposals. In his final statement, the father&#8217;s position was that all three of his children should be placed in his care. In his oral evidence his position changed twice. He accepted that E should stay with the mother. He then accepted that D and E should stay with their mother. The Local Authority expressed the concern that the father had not given any careful thought to the best outcome for the children, the practicalities of him caring for one or all the children or planning for those eventualities, such as where they would live and how to obtain suitable housing. </span></p>

Having regard to his immigration status, he is not entitled to public funds in the form of State welfare benefits. Based upon his stated income from employment, he would have very little money for food and bills let alone childcare while working. He provides financial support to his family abroad and he expressed no intention to divert or prioritise those funds to care for the subject children if they were placed in his care. When asked about the effect on any child in his care in the event that his immigration status was not secured and resulted in his removal, the father&#8217;s response was that the children should then be returned to the mother, appearing to demonstrate a lack of insight into the difficulties the children have experienced and the need for change, let alone insight into the difficulties of his own parenting. </span></p>

The social worker&#8217;s evidence was that the father idolised C. It is also clear on the totality of the evidence that the father was a significant influence on C at a time when the mother was working and the father was providing a large part of the care given to C.  The weight of the evidence was that C reacted to his mother with aggression, verbally and physically, behaviour which the professionals considered was copied from the father. Whilst the mother accepted she was not able to cope with the many challenges C presents with, the father appeared to have no insight into C&#8217;s behavioural difficulties and he appeared not to recognise any problems, notwithstanding the extraordinary amount of evidence he has access to. </span></p>

The mother asserted in her evidence that the father was extremely unpleasant and that he would punch holes in the doors of the property when the mother was inside the room, in the presence of the children. The evidence before the Court is that the father was extremely unpleasant in his interactions with the social worker, when his behaviour was aggressive and abusive in his use of language. That was consistent with the evidence of Dr Campbell who reported observations of the father being disrespectful of women. Further, notwithstanding the Court making a Non-Molestation Order at the outset of the proceedings, the father breached the Order by returning to the mother&#8217;s property on two occasions and entering the property, once whilst she was present. As a consequence, he was arrested and fined. </span></p>

A negative viability assessment was completed early in the proceedings which was not challenged. The paternal aunt gave evidence at the final hearing. The Court found no reason to depart from the conclusions reached in the viability assessment that the paternal aunt cannot be relied upon to work openly and honestly with Local Authority nor any reason to depart from the conclusion of the Local Authority that there had been an ambivalence on the part of the paternal aunt as to whether she and her husband wished to be considered as carers for C and a real doubt as to their commitment. The Court accepted the conclusion of the Local Authority that there had been no recognition on the part of the paternal family as to the problems facing C and the children generally. The Court accepted the conclusion of the Local Authority that there had been hostility toward and an unwillingness to work with professionals or to have anything to do with the Local Authority. The Court accepted the conclusion that the paternal family was unlikely to be cooperative with a full assessment and unlikely to work openly and cooperatively with the Local Authority, which would result in a delay in achieving permanency for C.</span></p>

The Children's Guardian observed this to be the case and C had a very good relationship and attachment to his carers. Accordingly, the Children's Guardian&#8217;s view was firmly that C should remain placed with his current foster carers.  His current carers were very keen to look after C in the long term.  Given C&#8217;s age, there would inevitably be a considerable impact on C of ending all links with his birth parents, siblings and wider family if an adoption Order was made. The highly important ties C has with his birth family could be maintained under a Care Order with a plan of long-term foster care which would otherwise not be maintained on adoption. This would reduce the impact on C considerably by allowing him to maintain those important ties with his parents, siblings, grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins through contact. </span></p>

Further, the Local Authority in its dealings with the mother did not adopt special measures particular to her needs. Whilst it had been highlighted some time ago that the mother may have signs of autism, the mother was not formally diagnosed until February 2019. By that time, the mother had already undertaken a lengthy residential assessment and was part way through her community-based assessment. </span></p>

That is likely to have been difficult for any parent but particularly difficult for the mother on account of her undiagnosed autism. There were several substantial changes in that placement with the children arriving and leaving at different stages of the assessment. That notwithstanding, the evidence before the Court was that the manager at the residential centre employed many models that were effective having regard to the mother&#8217;s undiagnosed autism. The manager told the Court specifically that she had training in autism. It is not surprising that the residential part of the assessment, albeit not without difficulties, was largely a positive one and resulted in the recommendation for further assessment in the community. </span></p>

It is clear from the evidence before the Court that a large number of different staff members came into the mother&#8217;s home during the morning and the evening, without the mother knowing in advance who would be attending and without the mother being provided with any or any accurate rota. The Court heard that on occasions, staff would change at short notice. It was clear to the Court that, unlike during the residential part of the assessment, the staff entering the mother&#8217;s home were either not specifically trained in autism or had limited training. Some members of staff worked more successfully with the mother than others. It is no coincidence that those members of staff employed some of the techniques used in the residential setting. It was also apparent on the evidence that on several occasions, the mother had staff from the assessment centre sitting with her in the home, particularly during evenings, when no assistance was provided or required, the children having been put to bed by the mother, whilst the staff waited around with little to do. On the mother&#8217;s evidence, she was often told that there were no problems by staff visiting the home, only for her then to receive criticism in the assessment. Further, the mother was provided with almost no suitable written feedback following the community-based visits. In contrast the mother was provided with helpful written feedback when undertaking the residential part of her assessment each week and the keyworker then discussed the feedback with her. That approach appears to have been successful. The Court accepted the convincing submission made on behalf of the mother that the approach adopted during the community-based assessment is likely to have resulted in the mother being confused.  </span></p>

The social worker accepted that she was unaware of the Department of Health guidance for social workers on dealing with autistic people. Some of the tools used in the form of worksheets were suitable. Others were less so, where the mother was required to think creatively around abstract lines and required to &#8216;read between the lines.&#8217; The social worker told the Court that PAMS tools were utilised, although the mother is not a person with a learning difficulty. The mother told the Court that at times she was made to feel stupid. The mother told the Court that during the lengthy parenting assessment by the Local Authority, she was given little praise and more criticism, which it was asserted on her behalf, was not the right approach for someone with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</span></p>

It was unfortunate, however, that prior to the final hearing, this case did not benefit from judicial continuity, the parties appearing before four different tribunals since the application was issued. The well-established principle of good practice, that case management of a complex case should be conducted by one Judge, was not achieved. In the family jurisdiction in particular, judicial continuity serves to ensure the identification of a Judge responsible for the conduct of all case management and interim hearings and the early identification of the Judge to conduct the final hearing. The many benefits to be achieved through allocation to a single Judge are well rehearsed. The relevant issues in the case are easier to identify. Only one Judge need read the case papers. Firmer judicial control can be exercised over a case and case management is more consistent with interim applications being heard by the same Judge. Experience has also shown that Judges to whom cases are allocated are able to accept a greater responsibility for the progress of cases and urgent applications heard in a timely manner. The aspiration of judicial continuity was ever more important in this case, having regard to general the guidance that autistic people may experience difficulties if the same Judge is not involved throughout the proceedings and having regard to the specific needs of the mother identified by the professionals, including the need to limit the numbers of people working with the mother to as few as possible.</span></p>

The Court accepted that not all the family support workers who attended the home were fully trained in autism and they lacked a full understanding of the mother&#8217;s condition. The contents of Dr Suleman&#8217;s report seemingly had not been shared with them. The large number of family support workers entering the home, was not consistent with Dr Suleman&#8217;s advice to limit the numbers of people working with the mother to as few as possible. The absence of written feedback and the use only of verbal advice and role modelling was not consistent with Dr Suleman&#8217;s advice.

The mother cared for E throughout the day while D attended pre-school. There were long periods when she parented the children alone with no concerns raised. There were no descriptions during these periods of the children running into the road or screaming or suffering accidents when in her care, as there had been with the older children. The school report for D suggested that he is secure at school and is developing well. The mother was punctual in taking him to school and the children were well presented and clean. D was described by the school as being a bright, confident child who always arrived with smile. Further, D was described as always being delighted to see his mother when she collected him from school. The manager at the residential unit described D as having behaviours of a normal child of his age and there were no significant reported concerns for E.  The staff members from the assessment centre told the Court that the mother responded appropriately to D&#8217;s health needs and accepted advice. The mother&#8217;s evidence was that she also took advice from her GP and appropriately changed D&#8217;s medication to something he found more palatable. The up-to-date evidence from the assessment centre in relation to the children appeared in contrast to Dr Phibbs&#8217; historic reports of the children from 2018. </span></p>

Further evidence was needed to fill the gap before final decisions could be made in respect of the children D and E, which would involve a regrettable further delay. Having regard to the nature of the mother&#8217;s specific needs, the Court determined that it was necessary for the case to exceed the statutory 26-week timescale in order to obtain further evidence to determine the case justly. Further assessment would impact on the welfare of the children having regard to that further delay. In the Court&#8217;s judgement, however, further assessment was necessary as the evidence otherwise available did not assist the Court in determining the outstanding issues relating to D and E. The potential harm to the children caused by the delay was far outweighed by the benefit to them of obtaining the evidence necessary to fairly and justly make the important decisions for their future permanence. In the Court&#8217;s judgement, there was a solid, evidence-based reason to believe that the mother was committed to making the necessary changes. Further, there was some solid, evidence-based reason to believe that the mother would be able to maintain that commitment with attuned, targeted support. Furthermore, there was solid, evidence-based reason to believe that the mother would be able to make the necessary changes within the timescales of the children, with such attuned, targeted support. Furthermore, the delay for the children was mitigated by them remaining in the care of their mother, and maternal uncle, such that there would be no change of circumstances for them in the interim. Whilst noting the concern expressed by the Children's Guardian that the window of opportunity for adoption would narrow the longer the delay, in the judgement of the Court, that was no sufficient reason to conclude the case in the absence of the necessary evidence to make informed, evidence-based decisions as to their permanence. Furthermore, noting the concern that delay might result in emotional harm to the children through their mother&#8217;s potential lack of attunement to their needs, the Court determined that the risk of future emotional harm could be mitigated through continued support in the family home through their maternal uncle, support from the maternal grandparents so far as they were able having regard to their commitments to A and B and through some ongoing input from support workers or social workers entering the home at a reduced frequency to that which was currently in place. </span></p>

No concerns had been raised by the school in relation to D&#8217;s needs not being addressed. The Independent Social Worker expressed a professional concern that there have been unrealistic expectations set by the Local Authority and that this has caused both the mother and the maternal uncle to not believe in their own abilities to co-parent effectively, which has eroded their confidence and which may be detrimental to them accessing future early intervention or support. The report concluded that the VIG work helped the mother and uncle to identify the importance of and need for one-to-one time with each of the children and to ensure they give time and listen to each of the children. The practical feedback appears to have been beneficial to the mother and uncle and they appeared to enjoy receiving the feedback and saw the benefits of the work. In the VIG work it was recognised that the mother and uncle worked well as a team and the Independent Social Worker commented that it was encouraging to see their strengths.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.03in"><span style="font-size:11pt">That no parent must be precluded from being able to parent effectively on account of a disability is a bedrock principle of family law. The extensive specialist expert evidence in this case reaffirms the importance of recognising that parents with autism are as individual as any other parent. There is a risk that professionals may apply a set of criteria or expectations in relation to parents in light of a diagnosis of autism without fully exploring that parent&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses. It is also important that a parent does not begin to explain or justify any difficulties in their parenting purely because of a diagnosis of autism. It is equally, if not more important, for professionals working with parents with autism to be alert to and take account of the parent&#8217;s individual needs when working with them, bearing in mind at all times the well-established principle that intervention by a Local Authority in a family may be appropriate but that the aim should be to reunite the family when the circumstances enable that and the effort should be devoted towards that end.  The Court&#8217;s assessment of a parent&#8217;s ability to discharge their responsibilities towards the child must always take into account the assistance and support which the authorities can offer, tailored to that parent&#8217;s individual needs. Those needs must be assessed carefully, by skilled professionals, specific to that parent, without applying generalised criteria or expectations.</span></p>

I accept, however, that Local Authority resources are not unlimited and the Local Authority must balance its resources for this family and resources for other families in need.  The Local Authority has, commendably, already invested a great deal of time and resources into the family over a lengthy period of time. Under the Supervision Order, the Local Authority is further committed to referring the mother to an autism advocate and refer the mother to further domestic abuse services. Additionally, the Local Authority will assist the maternal uncle in accessing a paediatric first aid course through the Family Centre when restrictions on social movements imposed by the government during the public health emergency are relaxed. The family will also have access to Children&#8217;s Services and the multi-agency group under universal services, including the family centre, health visitor and allocated social worker. The Local Authority is committed to providing written feedback after each social work visit. The range of services provided by the Local Authority under the Supervision Order will enable the Local Authority to continue to support the mother and maternal uncle to ensure that the needs of the children D and E are met consistently. The Local Authority will encourage the mother to engage with further professional support to enable her to learn new strategies to manage healthier relationships.  Furthermore, the children will be the subject of a Child In Need plan. The Local Authority will also assist the mother in making a backdated claim for Child Benefit. I accept the submission that Local Authority budgets do not stretch to further specialist VIG work. Whilst the VIG work undertaken to date has been useful in informing the professionals in the course of these proceedings, it is entirely understandable that this specialist work cannot be funded further for this family.</span></p>

Nevertheless, the Local Authority has recognised, commendably, that Ms Green is a professional trainer and the Local Authority proposes to undertake training work with Miss Green for its social work team, to enhance its expertise for the benefit of this family and other families within its area. That proposal appears to the Court to be a reasonable and creative solution.

I am told that F has reflected on advice given to him and now sees the benefit to the children of maintaining remote contact in the short term. The professionals entrust the maternal uncle to manage contact with flexibility, given the good working relationship between him and F. The professionals recommend a light touch of supervision by the maternal uncle in respect of F&#8217;s contact with the children, without too much intrusion, in a boundaried environment, where supervision can take place at suitable distance. I accept that the location of contact must be kept under review, having regard to the availability of contact spaces and having regard to changing advice from the United Kingdom government on restrictions on social movement. Contact should not take place in the mother&#8217;s home.

Paternity is not in dispute and the application for a Declaration of Parentage is not opposed by the mother.  To his credit, F has engaged in the proceedings since the outset.

The Court concludes that F has shown commitment and consistency. He remains present in E&#8217;s life and there remains an attachment between E and his father. F already has Parental Responsibility for the child D. A Declaration of Parentage will provide a formal legal document for the child E reflecting the reality of his parentage and putting him on an equal footing with his sibling, D.  It will also result in a legal record of his parentage he will have throughout his life.
