	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The background to this matter is as follows. The parties commenced their relationship in 2010. At that time, the father lived in Belgium and the mother in England. The father obtained employment in La R&#233;union and the parties cohabited in R&#233;union from 2012. R&#233;union is an oversees d&#233;partement of France and is governed by French law. Then parties entered into a civil partnership in 2014. Neither the mother nor the father holds French nationality. As I have noted, A was born in R&#233;union, in October 2016. The parties&#8217; relationship broke down in August 2018.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 15 November 2018 the mother left R&#233;union with A without the consent of the father. The mother was refused entry into the United Kingdom in circumstances where the father had obtained orders from the court in R&#233;union preventing the mother removing A from that territory. On 28 November 2018, the father made an application to the court in R&#233;union for a determination in respect of parental rights. The mother made a cross-application in the same terms. On 21 December 2018 the High Court of Saint-Denis in R&#233;union made a order establishing joint custody and directed a welfare report.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 6 February 2019 the Family Court Judge of the High Court of Saint-Denis gave judgment. The court has before it a translation of the decision of the court. The court awarded residence of A to the mother and lifted the prohibition on the mother removing A from R&#233;union. The latter decision was made on the basis of the High Court&#8217;s conclusion that the mother &#8220;must be free to settle where she wishes, insofar as her actions are not contrary to the child&#8217;s welfare and are not intended to deprive the father of his rights.&#8221; Within that context, the High Court concluded that there was nothing to prevent the mother from settling in England, her country of origin, if she wished to.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">As I have noted, the decision of the High Court of Saint-Denis rested its conclusion on the determination that the mother must be free to settle where she wishes provided, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, her actions were not intended to deprive the father of his rights. Within this context, with respect to contact between the father and A, the order of the High Court provided that A was to spend two weeks every two months with the father until she commenced education, plus one month in July to August, and thereafter all half term holidays and half of school holidays. The order further permitted the father to have contact with A in England &#8220;freely&#8221; subject to him giving 15 days notice.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The order of the High Court of Saint-Denis further noted that Art 373-2(3) of the French Civil Code required any change of residence by one of the parents that modified the terms of the exercise of parental responsibility must be the subject of notice to the other parent and, in case of disagreement, determination by the court. In addition, the order noted that all important decisions regarding residence were to be taken by the parents jointly and that any request to amend the provisions of the order was subject to a prior attempt at mandatory family mediation pursuant to Art 7 of the French Law of 18 November 2016, failing which an application to vary would be declared inadmissible.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 9 February 2019, the mother left R&#233;union for the jurisdiction of England and Wales. The father contends he was given little notice of this move. The mother and A have remained in England and Wales since that date. Some five weeks later, on 19 March 2019 and notwithstanding the terms of the order of the High Court of Saint-Denis dated 6 February 2021 regarding the requirement for mandatory family mediation prior to any application to vary the terms of that order, the mother made a without notice application to the Family Court sitting in Liverpool to vary the order made by the High Court and for a prohibited steps order under the <ref href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41" canonical="1989 c. 41" type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> to prevent the father from removing A from the jurisdiction of England and Wales. The application form alleged that there was a risk of abduction. However, the application also states that the father wished to take A for 15 days, which action was on the face of it consistent with the contact order made by the High Court of Saint-Denis on 6 February 2021 that A was to spend two weeks every two months with the father. In her first statement, the mother says she had changed her mind regarding the appropriateness of the level of contact she had agreed before the High Court and which that court had ordered.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In the Form C1A that accompanied her application, the mother alleged domestic abuse against the father by way of him &#8220;trapping&#8221; her in R&#233;union in November 2018 and being verbally abusive to her. Exhibited to the mother&#8217;s statement is an email from the mother&#8217;s lawyer confirming that in December 2020 the Disciplinary Chamber of the Medical Board of La R&#233;union sanctioned two doctors for wrongly representing the position in respect of the mother&#8217;s mental health. The mother contends that the father, who is also a doctor, was the instigator of this conduct.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The mother&#8217;s application came before District Judge Doyle on 15 March 2019 who, properly, declined to deal with it and re-allocated the matter to HHJ De Haas QC, then the Designated Family Judge for Cheshire and Merseyside. In doing so, District Judge Doyle rightly reminded the mother of the duty on a litigant making an application without notice to make known all matters relevant to the application, whether or not those matters support the making of the order sought. On 22 March 2019 HHJ De Haas QC declined to make an order on the grounds that the court had no jurisdiction to vary an order made by the High Court in R&#233;union having regard to the provisions of Art 9 of Counsel Regulation (EC) 2201/2003 (hereafter BIIa). Within this context, the contact between A and her father went ahead for two weeks in March 2019 in London, the mother stating in her written evidence that she told the father that she had lost A&#8217;s passport. A further period of two weeks contact took place in June 2019 in R&#233;union.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On 17 July 2019, the day on which the father was due to collect A for summer contact pursuant to the terms of the order of the High Court of Saint-Denis of 6 February 2019, the mother issued a further application in the Family Court sitting at Liverpool, again seeking to vary that order. That application was again made without notice to the father, although the justification for this course taken by the mother is unclear. The mother&#8217;s application dated 17 July 2019 asserted, in contrast to the earlier without notice application in March 2019, that there had not been any form of domestic violence and that there was no risk of child abduction. The grounds of the mother&#8217;s application were that the order of 6 February 2021 was not working, was too vague and was having an emotional and physical impact on A&#8217;s welfare based on her alleged response to contact with her father in March 2019.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The statement of the mother in support of her application argued for a wholesale revision of the arrangements for contact put in place by the High Court in Saint-Dennis in the order of 6 February 2019. On 17 July 2019 HHJ De Haas QC made a prohibited steps order to maintain the <span style="font-style:italic">status quo</span> and listed a return date on 18 July 2019 to enable the father to be given notice. In the event, the father was served with the application with insufficient time for him to attend the hearing but was able to speak briefly with the mother&#8217;s counsel. The father indicated that he wished to secure legal representation and requested an adjournment. Within this context, HHJ De Haas QC adjourned the matter until 16 August 2019 and continued the prohibited steps order preventing the father from removing A from the jurisdiction pending the further hearing. HHJ De Haas QC further directed that each party file and serve Skeleton Arguments addressing the question of whether the English Court had jurisdiction to vary the order made by the High Court of Saint-Denis dated 6 February 2019.</p>

Within this context, beyond a short contact on 25 June 2021, the father has now had no substantive direct contact with A since October 2019, a period of over 2 years. In these circumstances, on 2 August 2019 the father lodged an application in the Family Division of the Court of Appeal of Saint-Denis in R&#233;union appealing the order of the court in La Reunion made on 6 February 2019. The father contends that this was done in response to the mother&#8217;s refusal to comply with the contact provisions of that order.</p>

Her Honour Judge De Haas QC again directed the parties to file and serve Skeleton Arguments as to the jurisdiction of the English court to vary the order of the High Court in Saint-Denis dated 6 February 2019. Within this context, on 7 January 2020 the mother submitted that her application was first in time (when compared to the father&#8217;s appeal to the Court of Appeal in R&#233;union), that A was now habitually resident in England, that the father had engaged in the English proceedings and that his appeal to the Court of Appeal in R&#233;union was out of time. Against this, the father contended that the court was required to stay the proceedings pursuant to Art 19 of BIIa as his appeal remained extant before the court first seised on the original proceedings relating to parental responsibility in respect of the same child and involving the same cause of action.</p>

During the appellate proceedings the mother argued that the father had accepted the jurisdiction of England and Wales and, thus, that the Court of Appeal in R&#233;union should declare itself to lack jurisdiction. As a result of administrative delay, the father&#8217;s appeal was not heard and determined until 21 October 2020. The father&#8217;s appeal was successful and the order of 6 February 2019 was overturned. In its place, the Court of Appeal in R&#233;union made an order stipulating that A&#8217;s main residence be with her father. This court has before it a translation of the French appellate decision.

Within this context, the Court of Appeal held that an objection based on jurisdiction must be raised <span style="font-style:italic">in limine litis </span>but that it had not in this case been raised before the court of first instance; that the mother was not assisted by the provisions of Art 9 of BIIa in circumstances where that provision concerned access rights and the issue on appeal was residence; that there was nothing on the face of the order made by HHJ De Haas QC on 18 July 2019 that indicated the father had accepted the jurisdiction of the English court for the purposes of Art 12 of BIIa; and that the filing of the appeal by the father on 13 August 2019, before any hearing on the merits in the English court, supported the contention the father had not conceded jurisdiction.

In this respect, the mother relies on the fact that the High Court of Saint-Denis gave her permission to remove A to R&#233;union and, therefore, that removal was lawful. In this regard, Mr Gupta and Ms Parr pray in aid the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">In Re KL (A child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/75" isNeutral="true" canonical="[2013] UKSC 75" court="uksc" year="2013" jurisdiction="GB" type="case">[2013] UKSC 75</ref>. Whilst conceding that Art 9 of BIIa would have maintained jurisdiction with the court in R&#233;union with respect to access rights for a period of 3 months, Mr Gupta and Ms Parr point to the fact that this period had expired by the time the mother made her application.</p>

In support of this submission, Mr Gupta and Ms Parr point to the fact that Art 19 is not one of provisions of BIIa to which the operation of Art 8(1) is expressly subject under the provisions of Art 8(2). In the alternative, they submit that it is unclear how Art 8 and Art 19 interact when child&#8217;s habitual residence for the purposes of Art 8 changes during the currency of the <span style="font-style:italic">lis </span>under Art 19. Within this context, Mr Gupta raised the possibility of a referral being made to the CJEU on this question. I am satisfied this is not necessary for reasons I will come to.</p>

The mother submits that the parents prorogued by way of entering into the consent order approved by HHJ De Haas QC on 14 August 2021 providing that the English proceedings would be adjourned for three months to permit mediation and a prohibited steps order would continue in force during that period.</p>

Within this context, Mr Gupta and Ms Parr submit the court is under a positive duty to ensure the efficacy of A&#8217;s Art 8 rights, which can be achieved in this case only by ensuring she is not subjected to the upheaval that would come from now enforcing a French order made, on the mother&#8217;s submission, without any or any sufficient welfare analysis or account of A&#8217;s wishes and feelings.</p>

Further, they submit that the &#8216;consent&#8217; evidenced in that order was simply in respect of an agreement to mediate. In particular, Mr Setright and Ms Spruce submit that there is nothing on the face of that order, as would be required, that indicates that jurisdiction had been &#8216;expressly&#8217; or &#8216;unequivocally&#8217; accepted by the father, still less is there any reference to Art 12 of BIIa, and that had the mother wished for prorogation she should have sought the same from the father expressly. Finally, it is submitted on behalf of the father that the Court of Appeal in R&#233;union was invited to, and did, deal expressly with the mother&#8217;s assertion that the father had accepted the jurisdiction of England and Wales and determined that he had not. Within this context, Mr Setright and Ms Spruce submit that this conclusion, made in <span style="font-style:italic">inter partes</span> appellate proceedings in which the mother fully participated in the Member State of jurisdiction, and preceding in time any assertions made by the mother to this court, is conclusive of the question of prorogation. </p>

Within this context, they submit that the registration of the order (which order has been considered by both the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court in France in <span style="font-style:italic">inter partes</span> hearings with the full engagement of the mother to be the correct order) cannot fit within the narrow confines of Art 23(a) as being manifestly contrary to the public policy of this jurisdiction. Further, Mr Setright and Ms Spruce submit that the same conclusion is reached when cast in terms of A&#8217;s welfare, in circumstances where it is, they submit, clear from the French judgment in the Court of Appeal that the court heard arguments and reached a decision primarily motivated by considerations of welfare. Within this context, it is submitted on behalf of the father that the mother was able to advance any welfare arguments that she considered appropriate at both levels of appellate court in the French proceedings, that A and her father already enjoy a relationship and that the father has presented the court with details as to his plan for A were she to return with him to R&#233;union. </p>

In the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Mercredi v Chaffe</span> (Case C497/10PPU) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/report/2012/elr/1/22" isNeutral="false" canonical="[2012] Fam 22" reportSeries="elr" year="2012" type="case">[2012] Fam 22</ref>, relied on by Lord Wilson in <span style="font-style:italic">Re LC</span>, the CJEU noted that, as a general rule, the environment of a young child is essentially a family environment determined by the reference person or persons with whom the child lives, by whom the child is in fact looked after and taken care of and that this is even more true where the child concerned is an infant as an infant necessarily shares the social and family environment of the circle of people on whom he or she is dependent.

For as long as the Texan order remains in force, his mother is most unlikely to allow, let alone to encourage, him to spend his vacations in America with his father. Whilst conflicting orders remain in force, he is effectively denied access to his country of origin. Nor has his mother been exactly enthusiastic about contact here. The best chance that K has of developing a proper relationship with both his parents, and with the country whose nationality he holds, is for the Texas court to consider where his best interests lie in the long term. It is necessary to restore the synthesis between the two jurisdictions, which the mother&#8217;s actions have distorted. </p>

Indeed, the mother did not defend the Convention proceedings on the basis either of his objections or of a risk of harm should he be returned (although she did suggest that he had been settled here so long that to return would place him in an intolerable situation). Had it not been for our decision on habitual residence &#8211; which I accept that courts in some jurisdictions might consider debateable, it would have been our duty to return K to Texas under the Convention.&#8221;</p>

Just because, as a matter of fact, a child is habitually resident in a country jurisdiction does not <span style="font-style:italic">automatically</span> mean that that country has a jurisdiction it can exercise. Rather, the conclusion as to jurisdiction will depend on the application of the relevant legal principles to the fact of habitual residence. Within this context, and as is plain on their face, Art 8 and Art 19 are concerned with different things. Art 8 provides one of a number of bases (set out in Arts 8, 9, 10, 13 and 14 of BIIa) on which a court may establish jurisdiction under BIIa, namely the fact of habitual residence. Art 19 however, is concerned with which court is first seised of proceedings and which court, therefore, should first have the opportunity to establish its jurisdiction on one of the bases provided for in BIIa, during which time a court second seised is mandated to stay its proceedings. </p>

It is true that a judgment for the purposes of Brussels I is final even if an appeal is pending: e.g. Articles 37 and 46. But the object of Article 27 is to prevent irreconcilable judgments, and as a matter of policy it would be very odd if proceedings in the court second seised could continue even if on appeal the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established. Consequently, we consider (contrary to the view of the judge) that Article 27 applies until the proceedings in the court first seised are finally determined in relation to its jurisdiction. That would mean that the expression in Article 27.1 "until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established" should be interpreted to include the case where the court first seised has declared that it has no jurisdiction, but an appeal is pending against that decision, and that it would be unsatisfactory for the matter to be dealt with through a discretionary stay in the court seised second.&#8221; </p>

Without going into elaborate detail, the differences between the two may be illustrated by just one reference to the order that was there being sought to be enforced, I having decided that it should be registered. It was a consent order made by a Polish court on the basis of what they were told was the full consent of the mother and the father to the arrangements therein proved by that court. In fact, the mother was entertaining a grotesque fraud on the father and the court and was only ostensibly consenting to the order decreeing, amongst other things, extensive contact between father and daughter on the basis that it would give her opportunity, which she quickly availed herself of, of fleeing the country with the child and disappearing for as long as she could. I shall, despite the factual differences, nevertheless take the liberty of citing a brief passage from it to illustrate the all too obvious point that there may come a time when an order of a Member State is so stale (Miss Meyer's submission here) that, coupled with a variety of other powerful factors, a court would have to take a view in the light of welfare considerations as to whether or not that order should be recognised and/or enforced. Yet such a court would, in my judgment, remain powerfully constrained in so considering such an order by the necessary consideration of those matters set out in Art 23 of the Regulation, and would not readily or easily depart from the underlying principles of the Regulation.&#8221;</p>

In that sense there can in principle be an overlap between Art 23(a) on the one hand and Arts 23(b) and (d) on the other. So far so good.

With all respect to Macur J I simply fail to see how, in the circumstances as she has found them, it could be manifestly contrary to public policy to recognise the judgment of the Portuguese court. On the contrary, to take this course is, in truth, to embark, impermissibly and in breach of Art 26, upon a review as to its substance. Accepting, as I do, that manifest breaches of fundamental principles of procedural fairness can in principle engage Art 23(a), the fact is that this case, insofar as it is based on the mother's complaints about the process in Portugal or on the state of her emotional and mental health, falls far short of what is required to bring Art 23(a) into play.&#8221;</p>

It is of course possible to envisage a decision so ridiculous in child welfare terms that it would offend public policy. For example, this might arise if the beneficiary of the order was a gangster, a drug addict or a paedophile. Such a decision would be so offensive to the court's conscience that the Article would most likely be engaged. Here, however, even though a change in custody and country would be painful and might be damaging, D has a substantial relationship with his father and the mother has not raised any concerns about the father's abilities. Romania is the country of origin of both parents and the country of residence of both sets of grandparents.

The asking of the question does not in any way detract from other principles that are in play, for example, the convention policy under the Hague Convention for the return of the child to the jurisdiction of habitual residence or the no delay principle in domestic children legislation. Furthermore, the provisions of article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms are directly applicable (see above) with the consequence that the court is required to ask the question I have identified.</p>

Recognition is automatic by operation of law and the order remains valid notwithstanding a change in the habitual residence of the child. However, when a child's habitual residence changes, jurisdiction will shift to the new state of habitual residence and that court will, if seised of an application concerning the child, have a theoretically unfettered discretion to make orders under domestic law. However, the court in such a case is bound to recognise an existing order and, in the same way as it would not disregard an earlier order made by another domestic court, it must recognise an order made by another Member State. However, in appropriate cases it can make an order which makes different provisions to those made by the earlier order &#8211; although it cannot 'vary' the order itself. It should only do so (as it would in a purely domestic case) where there has been a change in circumstances which warrant making different provision. To do otherwise would permit the English court to act differently in an EU case as compared to a domestic case. If it does make different provision, the earlier order will not be susceptible to registration and enforcement, and there will exist a ground for non-recognition under Art 23(e). A '<span style="font-style:italic">later judgment</span>' to which Art 23(e) may apply is a judgment of a court with general jurisdiction that is given after the judgment which it is sought to enforce, see <span style="font-style:italic">E (Children)</span>.&#8221;</p>

As I have noted above, just because, as a matter of fact, a child is habitually resident in a country does not result automatically in that country having jurisdiction it can exercise. The conclusion as to jurisdiction will depend on the totality of the relevant legal principles against which the claim of jurisdiction falls to be evaluated. In the context of the competing contentions in this case, as made clear by Black LJ (as she then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G (A Child)</span>, the operation of Art 19 of BIIa does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> depend on the question of which court has jurisdiction, whether under Art 8 or otherwise, but rather on which court is first seised, in this case the French court. Within this context it is further clear, as confirmed in Dicey, Collins &amp; Morris, that the bases of jurisdiction under BIIa operate subject to any <span style="font-style:italic">lis</span> under Art 19. This is, as again recognised in Dicey, Collins &amp; Morris, consistent with the fact that, unlike the 1996 Hague Convention on which BIIa is substantially modelled, BIIa does operate the principle of <span style="font-style:italic">perpetuatio fori</span>. In circumstances where BIIa abides by this principle, a child may relocate from a Member State, but proceedings will nevertheless properly continue in the former Member State of habitual residence until they are completed or a transfer made under Art 15 of BIIa. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In the foregoing circumstances, it is in my judgment clear on the face of BIIa that where a court is first seised for the purposes of Art 19, and has thereafter established jurisdiction one of the other bases of jurisdiction provided for by BIIa, a subsequent change of the subject child&#8217;s habitual residence will not, because of the operation by BIIa of the principle of <span style="font-style:italic">perpetuatio fori</span>, result in the court first seised losing jurisdiction during the period for which the <span style="font-style:italic">lis</span> subsists.

As I have set out above, Art 12 requires the jurisdiction of the relevant court to have been &#8220;accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner&#8230;by the holders of parental responsibility&#8221;. Whilst the acceptance of jurisdiction can be express or otherwise, it must be<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>unequivocal for the purposes of Art 12, there is no indication of unequivocal acceptance by the father of the jurisdiction of the English court on the face of the orders made by the English court. Further, it is plain from each of the orders made by the English court that the father continued to seek to argue the question of jurisdiction and sought to do so both in the English proceedings and the French proceedings. Indeed, both parents argued the point fully in the French proceedings and the Court of Appeal in R&#233;union concluded that the father had not accepted the jurisdiction of the English court, which decision was left undisturbed by the French Cour de Cassation. There is no evidence before this court that would justify this court now going behind that conclusion. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The mother relies on two grounds of appeal, the first of which is that, pursuant to Art 23(a) of BIIa, recognition of the judgment of the Court of Appeal on R&#233;union would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the United Kingdom taking into account the best interests of A. When considering this ground, it is important to recall that under no circumstances may this court review the <span style="font-style:italic">substance</span> of decision of the French Court i.e. whether it was right or wrong. It is further important to recall that the Preamble to BIIa makes clear that recognition and enforcement of judgments given in a Member State should be based on the principle of mutual trust and the grounds for non-recognition should be kept to the minimum required. Within this context, the authorities make clear that non-recognition on the grounds of public policy is only envisaged where recognition or enforcement of the judgment delivered in another contracting state would be at variance to an unacceptable degree with the legal order of the state in which enforcement is sought in as much as it infringes a fundamental principle. Within this context, there should be no tendency in the enforcement process under BIIa to fail to recognise, and hence enforce orders, made by Member States. I reject the tentative suggestion of Mr Gupta, made during his oral submissions, that the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union has changed this position. In cases begun prior to 11pm on 31 December 2020, BIIa will continue to apply in full, as will each of the principles governing its application set out in the authorities.</p>

There is likewise nothing in the welfare outcome endorsed by the Court of Appeal in R&#233;union that makes it manifestly contrary to the fundamental principles applied in this jurisdiction.

However, the authorities make clear that this argument is difficult to make good in the context of recognition and enforcement as between Member States of BIIa. It is correct that the avoidance of delay in proceedings concerning children is central to the legal order in this jurisdiction. However, I am not satisfied that delay engendered by a lawful appellate process in a foreign jurisdiction can amount, particularly in circumstances where similar delays arise in this jurisdiction, to a manifest breach (having regard to the best interests of the child) of a rule of law regard as essential in the legal order of this jurisdiction or of a right recognised as being fundamental within that legal order. This much was recognised by Holman J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re N (Abduction: Brussels II Revised)</span>. Whilst I accept that the impact on of enforcing the order a significant time after it was made A may be adverse, at least in the short term, in the context of recognition and enforcement this has also previously been held not to be objectionable on public policy grounds where child has a substantial relationship with the parent seeking enforcement, the other parent has not raised any substantial concerns regarding parenting capacity and the child is returning to the country in which he or she was born, <span style="font-style:italic">per</span> Peter Jackson J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Re</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">D (Recognition and Enforcement of Romanian Order)</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I am also not persuaded that the mother has made good her ground of appeal under Art 23(b) of BIIa. Art 23(b) becomes operative where a child has not been given the opportunity to be heard, in violation of the fundamental principles of procedure of this jurisdiction. A was three at the time the order of 21 October 2020 was made by the Court of Appeal on R&#233;union. That is not an age that, in the context of the public policy of this jurisdiction, falls near the borderline above which giving the child an opportunity to be heard in private law proceedings through the direct gathering of his or her wishes and feelings might be regarded as routine. Rather, the wishes and feelings of a child of A&#8217;s age in October 2020, in so far as they might be capable of being established, would ordinarily be communicated to the court by the respective parties. Within this context, at the time of the order of 21 October 2021 A was of an age where, had the proceedings been in this jurisdiction, she would have been considered too young for her wishes and feelings to have been ascertained directly and both parents would have had the opportunity to make such representations as were open to them on the subject of her ascertainable wishes and feelings. Such opportunity was open to the parents in the French proceedings, who were each represented in those proceedings. Within this context, I am satisfied that it cannot be said that the enforcement of the French order would result in recognition or enforcement being at variance to an unacceptable degree with the legal order of the state in which enforcement is sought in as much as it infringes a fundamental principle concerning the participation of the child in private law proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The mother invites the court to embark on a reconsideration of the welfare assessment of the Court of Appeal in R&#233;union. That assessment was that it was in A&#8217;s best interests to move to the care of her father in circumstances where her mother was not permitting A to have the contact with her father that had been assessed by the French court to be in her best interests and in circumstances where it was not accepted that the father was incapable of meeting A&#8217;s needs. Within this context, and with the full participation of the mother in the proceedings, the court ordered that A should live with her father and have contact with her mother. Within this context, beyond the passage of time that has passed as the appellate process in the French courts has been completed, it is difficult to identify any change of circumstances that could ground a proper reconsideration by this court of the French order based on a change of circumstances. The father is still without the substantive contact with A ordered by the French court and, within that context, A continues to be deprived of a full relationship with her father in the manner contemplated by the terms of the original order made by the High Court of Saint-Denis. Whilst the mother contends that she has offered contact to the father which has not been taken up, those offers do not reflect the level or nature of contact which the French court considered to be in A&#8217;s best interests. Beyond her own statements relating matters that would have been substantially within her knowledge at the time of the hearing before the Court of Appeal in R&#233;union, the mother has adduced no additional welfare evidence before this court to suggest that the conclusion of the Court of Appeal in R&#233;union that the father could meet A&#8217;s needs requires revisiting by this court due to a change of circumstances.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re E (BIIa: Recognition and Enforcement) </span>was clear that any revisitation of a foreign welfare order in circumstances where the English court now has jurisdiction must take place in a manner akin to that adopted when reconsidering a domestic welfare order, namely by asking whether there has been a change of circumstances sufficient to justify a different welfare conclusion to that reached by the foreign court. For the reasons set out in the foregoing paragraph, I am not satisfied that such a change of circumstances justifying reconsideration of the French welfare order has occurred in this case. In those circumstances, I decline to revisit the French order on welfare grounds. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I accept that this conclusion means that A will now move from the care of her mother in this jurisdiction to the care of her father in R&#233;union. I likewise accept that this will have a significant, and potentially adverse, impact on A in the short term. However, I am further satisfied that it is possible to put in place so called &#8216;soft landing&#8217; provisions in the context of A having a pre-existing relationship with her father that has been maintained to a degree by indirect contact and in circumstances where no substantive concerns have been made out regarding the father&#8217;s parenting capacity. In particular, the parties will obviously wish to consider A being accompanied by her mother to R&#233;union, a period of gradual transition to the father&#8217;s care whilst the mother is in R&#233;union and a clear agreement with respect to future direct contact between A and her mother following her move to the father&#8217;s care pursuant to the French order which this court is enforcing. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I am not satisfied that this course of action amounts to an unnecessary and disproportionate interference in the Art 8 rights of A. I accept that the court is under a positive duty to ensure the efficacy of A&#8217;s Art 8 rights. As I have noted, I cannot accept the submission that the French order was made without any or any sufficient welfare analysis or without providing A an opportunity to be heard. Within this context, I am not able to accept the argument that enforcing the order constitutes a disproportionate breach of A&#8217;s Art 8 rights. Indeed, it is eminently arguable, in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in R&#233;union and the absence, as I have found, of any change of circumstances sufficient to justify revisiting that welfare decision, that not to enforce the French order would constitute a breach of A&#8217;s Art 8 right to respect for private and family life.</p>

Further, I am satisfied for the reasons I have given that this court must now enforce the order of the French court pursuant to the application of the father. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">That latter course will involve this court making an order that the mother now return A to R&#233;union in accordance with the order of the Court of Appeal of R&#233;union dated 20 October 2021, with such &#8216;soft landing&#8217; provisions as are appropriate to mitigate the short term impact on A of that course of action. I will invite leading and junior counsel to agree and submit an order for the court&#8217;s approval giving effect to the court&#8217;s decision.</p>
