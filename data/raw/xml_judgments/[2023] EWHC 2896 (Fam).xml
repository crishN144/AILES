	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an interlocutory decision in a private law family case concerning a 6 year-old boy XX. The Applicant, SK, is the Father, and the Respondent, RO, the Mother. The issue before the Court is whether a Special Advocate (&#8220;SA&#8221;) should be appointed and, closely associated with that decision, who should pay for the SA.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Mother applied for an order that XX live with her. At a final hearing in March 2022, an order was made that XX live with the Mother and a Prohibited Steps Order was made preventing the Father from removing XX from her care. In those proceedings the Mother made serious allegations of domestic abuse against the Father, and a Non-molestation Order was made. However, no findings of fact were made by the Court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Mother&#8217;s Schedule lists a series of very serious allegations against the Father. These include that he fractured her finger in July 2016 during an argument when he became enraged and she tried to lock herself in the bathroom to protect herself. A physical assault in 2017 when she was pregnant. The police were called and took no further action. After she left the family home, that the Father has threatened the Mother that he will pay someone to find her and then that he will come after her. In March 2021 the Father had come to her house late at night and the neighbours called the police. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 5 July 2022 Cafcass produced a safeguarding letter in which they record that the Mother alleged that domestic abuse was a feature of the relationship (including physical, emotional and controlling behaviour). She also alleged she had been assaulted by the paternal grandparents who removed XX from her. Cafcass recommended a fact finding hearing and that there should be no interim contact given the seriousness of the allegations and the lack of any existing relationship between XX and the Father. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Police disclosure was received on 12 December 2022 and a letter from Cafcass. In the light of this material the Mother&#8217;s representatives applied for the matter to be transferred to a High Court (or section 9) judge.  The Mother has made allegations which she does not wish to be shared with the Father. These allegations include, but are not limited to, a risk of honour based violence. The application was adjourned and HHJ Picken transferred the matter to the High Court.</p>

He says that he had tried to contact the Mother after they separated, but his solicitor&#8217;s letters received no reply. He went to her property because he was concerned about XX given the lack of information that he had received. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case first came before me on 16 February 2023. At that hearing I heard the Mother and the Police in a CLOSED hearing, and then invited the Father and his legal team to join for an OPEN hearing.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 26 April I had a further hearing at which the issue of how the Court should handle the non-disclosure of material, both from the WMP and from the Mother, should be handled. I ordered that the Mother and Father&#8217;s legal teams apply for exceptional funding from the Legal Aid Agency (&#8220;LAA&#8221;) to cover the cost of a SA and to make enquiries of SASO. At the hearing the WMP agreed to pay a proportion of the costs of a SA in light of the fact that some of the material which the Court had ruled could not be shown to the Father emanated from the Police. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The LAA have now rejected the application for exceptional funding. At a further hearing in June 2023 I indicated that in my view the case was sufficiently complex as to justify exceptional funding. The parties appealed the LAA&#8217;s decision, but the appeal has also been rejected. So the only further step possible in relation to Legal Aid is to judicially review the LAA. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SASO have written to the Court on 3 October 2023 indicating that they are not minded to appoint a SA. Firstly, the Attorney General is not prepared to appoint a SA until the question of funding has been resolved. Secondly, this is not a case concerning classified information or where vetting would be required. SASO suggested that a confidentiality ring approach might be appropriate whereby the Father&#8217;s lawyers are given the information but not the Father. SASO estimated that the costs of a SA might be &#163;20-30,000; the WMP offer is to pay 50%, i.e. &#163;15,000. </p>

In my judgment, the police, having taken this position (which I emphasise has been approved as reasonable and appropriate thus far), should be required to broaden its obligations to ensure that those who are most affected by the information are given the fullest and fairest opportunity to have the case for non-disclosure tested...I am further influenced in reaching my conclusion in this case by the fact that the local authority plays no part in the closed material process, and has no intention of doing so; it does not possess, or otherwise have access to, any sensitive material.&#8221;</span></p>

Ms Bhachu on behalf of the Mother submits that I must consider the CLOSED material if I am to fairly consider the Mother&#8217;s case.  I am severely constrained in what I can say about this in an OPEN judgment. However, I am satisfied that in order to determine what is in XX&#8217;s best interests I have to have regard to the entirety of the Mother&#8217;s allegations and the police disclosure. If I do not do so there is a real possibility that I will not properly assess the safeguarding issues that go to XX&#8217;s best interests. </p>

SASO have suggested a confidentiality ring, such as might be used in a commercial case. However, in my view that would place the Father&#8217;s lawyers in a professionally unacceptable situation. They would be potentially privy to allegations against their client which they could not share with him. In my view it would not be possible for them to meet their professional obligations to him whilst having this information. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, if the Court has the CLOSED material, but there is no process by which anyone acting on behalf of the Father can challenge that material, that will significantly impede the fairness of the proceedings. In all CLOSED material cases there is some infringement on the fairness of the process for the party who is excluded. Therefore, some compromises have to be made. Necessarily the nature of those compromises will greatly vary depending on the facts of the case, the risks involved and the nature of the CLOSED material. There are no hard and fast rules. The issues in this case lead me to the view that the Father&#8217;s ability to challenge the case being put against him in CLOSED necessitates the appointment of a lawyer who can represent his interests in that part of the hearing. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The lawyers do not have to be DV vetted given that this is not a national security case. However, there are significant procedural advantages in using SASO and counsel from the Attorney-General&#8217;s Special Advocate Panel given that they are familiar with this type of proceedings and the rules and challenges that go with it. The Mother has raised serious risks to her and XX by reason of the Father&#8217;s conduct, and it is therefore apparent that issues concerning the State&#8217;s positive obligations under Articles 2 and 3 may arise. Again, it is not possible to set out details of this in an OPEN judgment, but given the context of the case I consider it appropriate and pragmatic to request the Attorney-General to appoint a Special Advocate to represent the Father&#8217;s interests with the assistance of SASO.</p>

I fully accept that this is a problem with setting a cap. However, the grounds for making the Police pay unrestricted costs are much less strong than in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re R</span> because much of the information is not held by them. Further, I think it is wholly realistic that the SA&#8217;s costs can be limited here to &#163;15,000. There is not a large amount of CLOSED material, and therefore the preliminary gisting exercise will be a limited one. Further, the factual issues that arise in this case are not especially complex and I have no doubt the case can be finished easily within three days, even with a SA. Given that SAs are paid on Government Legal Department hourly rates, &#163;15,000 goes a very long way. I appreciate the sum also covers the solicitor&#8217;s costs, but these are also on Government rates. </p>

It will entail very strict cost budgeting by SASO, but cost budgeting is a feature of civil cases, so I am optimistic it can be adopted here.</p>
