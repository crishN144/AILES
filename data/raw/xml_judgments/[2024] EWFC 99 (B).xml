Mary had already been made the subject of a Care Order in favour of the local authority in October 2018. The matter was before the Court by reason of Alice&#8217;s application for contact to a child in care issued on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2023. In fact, as that judgment relates, the local authority came to the view that the care plan for Mary should change to one whereby Mary was removed from Bethany&#8217;s care.</p>

She is, however, emotionally fragile. She has faced and continues to face significant instability and uncertainty.

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;there is no evidence before the court that she has made any significant changes since the original set of care proceedings were completed. In particular I have considered the psychological report that was completed during those proceedings and the judgements by the court made against [Bethany] when the care order was made with a care plan that [Mary] should be placed in [Alice]&#8217;s care&#8230; I believe there is no substantial evidence before the court that [Bethany] has made any significant changes, indeed I feel there is a substantial case that with the alleged abduction by [Bethany] and the posting on the Internet of the video of [Mary] during the initial hearing would indicate that at the very least her ability to meet [Mary]&#8217;s emotional needs has not progressed since the original care proceedings. In light of this I do feel that [Bethany] continues to pose significant risks to [Mary]&#8217;s emotional well-being that means she cannot be placed back in her care.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I agree with the Guardian&#8217;s analysis. As set out in my April 2023 judgment, the expert assessments undertaken in the previous sets of proceedings concluded that Bethany was unable to promote a relationship between Mary and Alice; that she would appear to cooperate but then undermine that relationship; and that her personality characteristics are histrionic, turbulent and domineering. In my assessment not only is there no evidence to suggest that such assessments are now incorrect but in fact the events that have taken place during these proceedings positively contribute to the conclusion that they remain highly relevant and accurate.</p>

Her posting on social media, her failure to attend court, periods of refusal to attend contact unless it takes place precisely on her terms and her lack of co-operation with the ISW and the Guardian are all, in my opinion, manifestations of those personality characteristics and behaviours identified as long ago as 2017.</p>

All the evidence suggests that when Mary has contact with Bethany in a supervised setting the experience for Mary is positive. Likewise, I have no doubt at all that Mary and Bethany share a loving bond that is reciprocal and, absent the risks identified, could be very positive for Mary. </p>

Through no fault of her own she lost contact with Mary for extended periods of time and has had to endure years of court proceedings. At times, despite numerous judgments and assessments that have endorsed her position as a capable, attuned and appropriate parent, it must have seemed as if they were not worth the paper they were written on. Despite that, Alice has never objected to contact between Mary and Bethany. She has in the past been criticised for being too focused on the past. History has shown that she was right to highlight her concerns when the local authority was exercising its parental responsibility in a way that was in ignorance of the risks and was not in Mary&#8217;s welfare interests.</p>

It would, in my view, be wrong to continue a care order just to ensure that a particular resource from the local authority (i.e. contact supervisors) remains available. The local authority have at present given a somewhat open-ended commitment to continue to supervise contact, at least for the duration of a supervision order and possibly beyond. However, there will come a time when that resource may no longer be available.</p>

Secondly, such a period would cover the transition from primary school to secondary school. Thirdly, the evidence of harm and disruption to Mary is such that a longer period of recovery and stability is warranted.
