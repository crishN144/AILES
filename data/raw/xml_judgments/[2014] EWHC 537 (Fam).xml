	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case the original consent order for ancillary relief was made as long ago as 8 April 1999. Each party applied to vary it, and in the case of the wife she applied for the maintenance order to be capitalised. On 11 May 2005 Charles J handed down a full judgment disposing of the cross-applications. He ordered the husband to pay a lump sum of &#163;1.3m on a clean break basis; to pay child support; and, together with a company owned and controlled by him, to pay costs of &#163;324,000. The husband sought leave to appeal. Permission was granted on 13 October 2005 on terms that the husband provided security for costs. Thorpe LJ invited the parties to participate in the Court of Appeal mediation scheme. A mediation took place led by His Honour Clive Callman. An agreement was reached which substituted a new figure of &#163;926,000 for the lump sum of &#163;1.3m. The agreement was incorporated in a consent order made by Wall LJ on 21 January 2006. The new figure was to be paid in instalments. The first instalment was &#163;700,000 and was to be paid by 31 December 2006. If an instalment was missed the mediated agreement and consent order of Wall LJ dissolved and the original order of Charles J revived in full. By 31 December 2006 the husband had paid only &#163;315,000. Therefore the agreement and order of 21 January 2006 dissolved and the order of Charles J of 11 May 2005 revived.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 21 April 2010 the wife issued a Statutory Demand for payment claiming that the husband owed her, with interest, just under &#163;2m. The husband applied to set the demand aside. There were a number of hearings. Eventually the parties entered into an agreement on 2 November 2011 by which, inter alia, the wife withdrew the Statutory Demand. On that same day an order was made in the Court of Appeal discontinuing the husband&#8217;s appeal.</p>

If there is such an implied term the husband claims that it is itself subject to an implied term that his obligations would not stretch ahead indefinitely.

The husband says that the wife is debarred from proceeding to enforce by virtue of the agreement to mediate on 2 November 2011. The wife strongly disputes this. She says that the court cannot force or coerce her to mediate, whatever she might have agreed.</p>

Further, by CPR rule 26.4(2A) the court may, on its own initiative, and whether or not the parties agree, impose a stay on proceedings for a specified period to &#8220;allow for settlement of the case.&#8221; It is tolerably clear (at least to me) that the power under rule 26.4(2A) may be exercised by the court at any time and not just when a party files the completed allocation questionnaire. Curiously, and in contrast to the FPR 2010, the CPR does not contain a Part devoted to ADR.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As things stand, the court cannot impose a mandatory order on the parties that they must participate in ADR. This much is clear from <span style="font-style:italic">Halsey v Milton Keynes General NHS Trust</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 1 WLR 3002" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 1 WLR 3002</ref>. There Dyson LJ stated at para 9 &#8220;It seems to us that to oblige truly unwilling parties to refer their disputes to mediation would be to impose an unacceptable obstruction on their right of access to the court.&#8221; However, the court can robustly encourage and coerce participation in ADR, specifically by making clear that costs sanctions might await parties who unreasonably refuse to do so. In para 30 Dyson LJ referred to an order commonly made in the Admiralty and Commercial Court which requires the parties to take &#8220;such serious steps as they may be advised to resolve their disputes by ADR procedures&#8221; and that if the case is not settled &#8220;the parties shall inform the court what steps towards ADR have been taken and (without prejudice to matters of privilege) why such steps have failed." Obviously, the second part of the order is there to enable the court to make an order for costs if it formed the view that a party had unreasonably refused to engage in ADR. But as Dyson LJ makes clear the order &#8220;stops short of actually compelling the parties to undertake an ADR,&#8221; although it might be thought that the nature of the coercion amounts to much the same thing. Similarly, in paras 33 and 34 Dyson LJ refers to and approves the eponymous Ungley Order which requires the parties to consider whether the case is suitable for ADR, and the terms of which are designed to bring home to them that, if they refuse even to consider that question, they may be at risk on costs even if they are ultimately held by the court to be the successful party. </p>

The defendant was heavily penalised in costs. Briggs  LJ stated at para 4 &#8220;silence in the face of an invitation to participate in ADR is, as a general rule, of itself unreasonable, regardless whether an outright refusal, or a refusal to engage in the type of ADR requested, or to do so at the time requested, might have been justified by the identification of reasonable grounds.&#8221;</p>

The scheme was incorporated into the Family Proceedings Rules 1991 and extended nationwide in 2000. The rules governing the FDR are now to be found in Part 9 of the FPR 2010 and in the accompanying Practice Direction PD9A.
