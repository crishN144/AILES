		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus in Administrative Court cases just as in other civil litigation, particularly where a claim has been settled, there is, in my view, a sharp difference between (i) a case where a claimant has been wholly successful whether following a contested hearing or pursuant to a settlement, and (ii) a case where he has only succeeded in part following a contested hearing, or pursuant to a settlement, and (iii) a case where there has been some compromise which does not actually reflect the claimant's claims. While in every case the allocation of costs will depend on the specific facts, there are some points which can be made about these different types of case.</p>

	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority resists this, in summary because, it asserts: (a) that it was relying on the Registrar General&#8217;s published guidance in the Handbook &#8211; so it is the Registrar General who should be paying X&#8217;s costs; (b) that it adopted an approach to the proceedings that was helpful, sensitive and pragmatic in seeking to arrive collaboratively at the right outcome, for instance by not challenging the grant of permission out of time; and (c) that it does not necessarily agree X&#8217;s account of events on the two occasions when he and his partner sought to register the births (raising in this connection the question of why neither X and his partner nor the clinic drew the Registrars&#8217; attention to the Form IC). The Registrar General makes similar submissions and adds as further reasons why there should be no order for costs: (a) that the dispute of fact as to precisely what happened on the two occasions when X and his partner sought to register the births remains unresolved (see <span style="font-style:italic">Case K</span>, para 15); and (b) that the clinic was to blame (i) in setting off the whole chain of events and (ii) in failing to assert to the local authority (see, again, <span style="font-style:italic">Case K</span> para 15)<span style="font-style:italic"/>that there was in fact an adequate written notice, a Form IC, even though there was no Form WP and no Form PP.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The short point, at the end of the day, in my judgment, is that, as against the local authority, X was completely successful. The claim was conceded, and my judgment proceeded, on the short ground that the Registrar (for whose acts the local authority is liable) erred in law refusing to register the births: <span style="font-style:italic">Case K</span>, paras 23-25, 30-31. X succeeded in his legal argument and obtained the order he wanted.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, none of the various points canvassed by the local authority and the Registrar General provides any justification for departing from the general approach outlined in <span style="font-style:italic">R (M)</span>. The fact that what actually took place before the Registrar remains to an extent unresolved is neither here nor there, for the Registrar&#8217;s error of law was conceded and, having been conceded, was determinative. The fact that the Registrar was relying on the Registrar General&#8217;s Handbook is neither here nor there as between X and the local authority. The fact that but for the clinic&#8217;s initial error there never would have been the need for proceedings is factually correct but, again, neither here nor there. To repeat: X succeeded because of what is conceded to have been the Registrar&#8217;s error of law. That, at the end of the day is, in my judgment, the factor of magnetic, indeed determinative, significance. I should add that the point faintly argued by the Registrar General, based on something said by the clinic <span style="font-style:italic">before </span>there was any suggestion of judicial review proceedings, that I am entitled to infer that the clinic will meet X&#8217;s costs of the judicial review proceedings, is in my judgment wholly lacking in merit and cannot in any event have survived the very clear order set out in paragraph 2 above.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to consider the question of whether the Registrar General should be ordered to pay the local authority&#8217;s costs. The local authority&#8217;s key point is that, as it would have it, the real cause of what happened was what is now accepted to have been the error in the Registrar General&#8217;s Handbook. The Registrar General, on the other hand, points to: (a) the principle that an interested party is normally neither entitled to costs nor exposed to liability for costs (see <span style="font-style:italic">R Smeaton) v Secretary of State for Health </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2002/886" uk:canonical="[2002] EWHC 886 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWHC 886 (Admin)</ref>, [2002] 2 LR 146, paras 431-435); (b) various of the factors I have referred to in paragraph 6 above; (c) the fact that the Registrar never sought guidance from the Registrar General before deciding not to register the births; and (d) the fact that &#8220;in law&#8221; the error was that of the Registrar, for whom the local authority is liable, and that the attempt to make the Registrar General liable is &#8220;misguided in light of the statutory scheme.&#8221; </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, the fair, just and reasonable outcome in this most unusual case is that, so far as their <span style="font-style:italic">own </span>costs are concerned, the local authority and the Registrar General should each bear their own costs. In their different ways, each has to bear a significant measure of responsibility for having put X in a position where, if he was to be rescued from the position in which the state&#8217;s failings had put him (see <span style="font-style:italic">Case K</span>, para 21), he had no choice but to issue a claim for judicial review. I can see no real justification for ordering either to pay the costs of the other. The real question, in my judgment, is whether the Registrar General should be required to reimburse the local authority in relation to the costs I have ordered it to pay X.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the competing submissions summarised in paragraph 10 above highlight, both the Registrar General and the Registrar share some measure of responsibility for what happened, the one because of the error in the Handbook, the other because of the omission to seek further guidance. To leave the local authority alone responsible for meeting X&#8217;s costs would, in my judgment, significantly and unfairly exonerate the Registrar General from the consequences of the uncorrected error in the Handbook but for which the problem would never have arisen. As I have already said, in their different ways, each has to bear a significant measure of responsibility for having put X in the position in which he found himself. In my judgment, broad justice will be done as between the local authority and the Registrar General if I order the Registrar General to reimburse the local authority one-half of the costs that I have ordered the local authority to pay to X, in other words, the sum of &#163;8,255.06.</p>
