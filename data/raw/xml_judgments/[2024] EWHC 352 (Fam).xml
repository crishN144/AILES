I have heard oral evidence from both parties, the father&#8217;s through an Italian interpreter; I have also read 2 statements by the father, 2 by the mother in addition to her answer in the proceedings, and one by the maternal grandfather, along with police and CAFCASS evidence. I have then reserved this judgment for a matter of days. I should say that the father&#8217;s application under the provisions of the 1980 Hague Convention was made only on 12 October 2023, so that this cannot be classed as a &#8216;hot pursuit&#8217; case.</span></p>

But in evaluating the evidence the court will of course be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of the Hague Convention process.

Ms Chaudhry quite rightly pointed out that, insofar as this might amount to an assertion of consent, that this would become relevant not to the Art.3 question of whether there has been a wrongful removal, but rather as a potential defence under Art.13; as a path to an exercise of discretion, rather than as a complete defence under Art.3. </span></p>

Whereas acquiescence is expressly recognised to be acquiescence subsequent to the removal, consent is not so limited in Article 13 and must, therefore, include permission which is given before the removal. If clear unequivocal and informed consent is given to the removal of a child, then it is difficult to see why the court should not exercise the discretion conferred by Article 13 to permit the child to remain in the country to which it was agreed he or she should go. The policy of the Convention is to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention. If a child is removed in&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">prima facie</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">&#160;breach of a right of custody, then it makes better sense to require the removing parent to justify the removal and establish that the removal was with consent rather than require the claimant, asserting the wrongfulness of the removal, to prove that he or she did not consent. Article 3 should govern the whole Convention and Article 13 should take its place as the exception to the general duty to secure the return of the child which is, after all, the basic principle of the Convention.&#160;</span></p>

At that point the father telephoned her, and she handed the phone to the Officer, who invited the father to attend at the Police station, which he duly did. Although the parents did not speak to each other on that day, they each spoke to the Officer, and the father was persuaded to return home during the morning to collect the children&#8217;s passports which he subsequently brought back to the station.

Instead, it was apparent that the father did feel obliged to hand over the passports by the involvement of the Italian police.

The mother obtained a council tenancy for a flat in London W10 in 2015, which she has retained ever since. After the birth of XR, the father came to live with the family in London on a visitor visa, and although over the years since mother and children have spent time in Italy with the father, including the father says for over a year up to late 2019, I accept this had always been on a temporary basis at least up until the summer of 2022.</span></p>

Both letters are signed by the school&#8217;s head teacher, and are in otherwise identical terms, the first from October 2023, the second from January 2024. Whilst I cannot determine how the school have sent out these two different accounts, I am satisfied that XR&#8217;s time at the school was not especially settled. The mother says that he was unhappy as he did not speak Italian from the outset, and that she was told by the father that he would have to redo a year to catch up with his peers. Whilst the father does not accept that he struggled at all, his lack of native Italian must have been a challenge at first, and I therefore prefer the mother&#8217;s account in this respect.

The social and family environment of an infant or young child is shared with those (whether parents or others) on whom she is dependent. Hence it is necessary, in such a case, to assess the integration of that person or persons in the social and family environment of the country concerned.

She describes staying at home with the children whilst the father went out to work all day, and that neither she nor the children made many friends during the period, hampered by their language difficulties as none of them were fluent in Italian. She blames her own unhappiness and the breakdown of the relationship squarely on the abuse which she says that she was receiving from the father throughout this period.

There are also allegations against the paternal grandmother. I note that there is evidence that the mother reported the abuse to Officer Cillis, at about the time of her departure. I cannot determine whether these allegations, which are all denied, are in fact true, but I must proceed on the basis that they may be true, and if so, there can be no doubt that a return to Italy would cause significant stress for the mother, and for the children, they would be potentially impacted not only by the risk of further abuse, but also both by their own memories of suffering previously, and also by the mother&#8217;s potential reaction to a return to a place where she has been both profoundly unhappy, and the victim of abuse herself.</span></p>

He offers limited funding to cover travel and rental costs, including a deposit, which he agreed to extend through counsel from his initial offer of covering only the period up to the first welfare hearing after return in the Italian court, to a later date; and to pay undefined &#8216;reasonable maintenance&#8217; for the same period. He also offered not to support any criminal proceedings against the mother in respect of the abduction, not to attend at the airport on her arrival with the children, not to communicate with her save in respect of the children&#8217;s arrangements, and not to go within 200 meters of any property in which she or the children were living, pending that first hearing. He has also offered a standard form non-molestation undertaking. </span></p>

Given the serious nature of the as yet unproved allegations which the mother makes, I consider that these measures would fall significantly short of what a court might require before a return order could be considered. Because of my findings about habitual residence, however, I need not go further in this judgment.</span></p>

The object of securing a swift return to the country of origin cannot be met. It cannot any longer be assumed that that country is the better forum for the resolution of the parental dispute. So the policy of the Convention would not necessarily point towards a return in such cases, quite apart from the comparative strength of the countervailing factors...</span></p>
