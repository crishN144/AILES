The starting point is that the court should give effect to an agreement that is freely entered into by each party with a full appreciation of its implications unless in the circumstances prevailing it would not be fair to hold the parties to their agreement (see <span style="font-style:italic">Granatino v Radmacher</span> [2010] UKSC <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 AC 534" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 AC 534</ref><span style="font-style:italic"/>at [75]).

It is not obliged to tabulate all the assets and liabilities and to work out the precise quantitative or relative outcomes for each party under the agreement. Instead, in a fairly summary manner, the court can instead stand back, survey the evidence broadly, and decide if the agreement meets the standard of basic fairness.</p>

The parties are unlikely to have intended that their ante-nuptial agreement should result, in the event of the marriage breaking up, in one partner being left in a predicament of real need, while the other enjoys a sufficiency or more, and such a result is likely to render it unfair to hold the parties to their agreement.&#8221;</p>

I do not take the language used by the Supreme Court, namely "predicament of real need" as signifying that needs when assessed in circumstances where there is a valid prenuptial agreement in play should be markedly less than needs assessed in ordinary circumstances. If you have reasonable needs which you cannot meet from your own resources, then you are in a predicament. Those needs are real needs.&#8221;</p>

The right book-end represents a comfortable, perhaps even luxurious, life-style. The left book-end represents a spartan lifestyle catering for not much more than essentials. The space in between is the discretionary range. When the Supreme Court says that it may not be fair to uphold an agreement which leaves the applicant in a predicament of real need, it is clearly saying that if the result of the agreement would place the applicant in a standard of living to the left of the left-hand bookend, then that would be unfair. It is also saying that to make the agreement fair it should be augmented by no more than is necessary to move the applicant&#8217;s lifestyle just to the right of that left-hand bookend.</p>

In the proceedings below this argument was not pleaded or otherwise prefigured in writing. As stated above, the recital to the order of 2 March 2022 specifically records that the wife did not challenge the agreement on the ground that it was not legally concluded i.e. that it was vitiated. Certainly, there is no mention of such an argument in the judgment, and nothing was said about it in the wife&#8217;s appeal notice or grounds of appeal.</p>

The wife is a highly intelligent person, until February 2018 a Professor of International Relations, fluent in five languages, who knows exactly what is and is not procedurally permissible. I have to say that I regard her raising of this inflammatory allegation for the first time before me as being an example of a fixated approach to this litigation against the husband, which has endured for seven years. However, I will explain that I consider that this fixated approach is not entirely unjustified.</p>

If the court concludes that a substantive order is needed to meet the applicant&#8217;s needs the court should only make the award in such amount and for such a period as to avoid the applicant suffering undue hardship. The applicant must show good reasons why a non-extendable term maintenance order should not be made.

As such, the general rule of no order as to costs laid out in FPR 28.3(5) ought to apply to the proceedings. However, it has been held, in authority which I should follow unless there are powerful reasons not to, that the rule does not apply to an application that a concluded agreement be made an order of the court: <span style="font-style:italic">T v T</span> [2013] EWHC B3 (Fam).

The judge also found that the wife, with due diligence, could have found out for herself the matters which the husband failed to disclose. I will be considering the correctness of these findings later in this judgment. If the judge&#8217;s findings are correct there is no good reason why the principle should not be applied and the wife ordered to pay all, or at least part of the husband&#8217;s costs, subject to the court being satisfied that she has the means to pay them. On the other hand, if the judge&#8217;s findings are not correct then it will be difficult for the husband to resist an order that he pay the wife&#8217;s costs as a litigant in person. Therefore, the outcome of this ground depends entirely on my decision on grounds 1 and 4.</p>

The judge had earlier found in para 71 that the wife had, apart from her pension funds, assets worth about &#163;745,000 (see my para 42 above). But here in her para 93 the judge is ignoring the value of the second investment property (which she had taken at the husband&#8217;s figure of &#163;145,000) together with the wife&#8217;s savings and the unused LSPO. Further, it is not clear what finding the judge is making as to the likelihood of the wife having to repay all (or indeed any) of her debts. Although she expresses scepticism as to the debts due to the solicitors and to members of her family, it is unclear whether she is saying that, on the balance of probability, she is satisfied that the debts will not have to be paid. </p>

But the law is clear that there is no such duty of due diligence imposed on the victim of a fraudulent deception: see <span style="font-style:italic">Takhar v Gracefield Developments Ltd &amp; Ors</span> per Lord Sumption at [54] &#8211; [66].

The requirement in <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> (1843) 3 Hare 100 that a litigant should bring forward his whole case in the first set of proceedings does not apply in such circumstances, and there are no good policy reasons to allow the fraudulent party to rely upon the passivity or lack of due diligence of his opponent.&#8221;</p>

That the wife had a vague subjective belief that the husband had inherited a sizeable estate (all of which was admittedly non-matrimonial property and could only be taken into account to meet the wife&#8217;s needs claim) could not possibly, in my judgment, have led a trial court rightly to conclude that:</p>

Non-disclosure is a bane which blights far too many financial remedy cases. Litigants must understand that if they practise non-disclosure then the almost invariable consequence will be a set-aside with costs. The exceptions should be construed very narrowly indeed.</p>
