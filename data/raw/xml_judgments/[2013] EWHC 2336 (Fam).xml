	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue arises in care proceedings brought by Camden social services in respect of three girls, Y (aged 11), P (10) and K (4). Their mother lived originally in Venezuela where she gave birth to Y and P. According to the mother, the girls&#8217; father died when she was expecting P, and in about 2005 she took the girls to Spain where she was allowed to stay as her grandmother came from Catalonia. In 2007, she started a relationship with a Scotsman, GM, who was living in Spain and the following year they were married, and the family moved to Nairn in Scotland. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother alleges that, after she became pregnant again in 2009, her relationship with GM deteriorated and she was subjected to abuse and violence. The couple separated and, following K&#8217;s birth, a sheriff in Inverness granted the mother a residence order and permission to remove K from Scotland to Spain. In the event, the mother stayed in Scotland living initially in the former matrimonial home, but in 2011, having been evicted from that property, which was apparently owned by her former mother-in-law, she moved with the girls to Edinburgh where they were accommodated with the assistance of the National Asylum Support Service. </p>

They were placed temporarily in a refuge but the following week the mother returned to Scotland, allegedly to attend a court hearing, leaving the girls in the care of another resident at the refuge. The children were taken into police protection and placed in foster care. </p>

The mother returned to London, and had supervised contact with the children during which she seemed very tired and in a low mood. Assessments disclosed concerns about the mother&#8217;s mental health and parenting capacity. She made a series of allegations that the children had been ill-treated in foster care. In April, the mother moved back to Scotland and has not seen the children for three months. Meanwhile, K&#8217;s father has contacted social services wishing to care for his daughter and alleging that he had a residence order in his favour made by a Spanish court in 2009. </p>

The basic rule is set out in article 8.1 which provides that &#8220;the courts of a Member Stare shall have jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time the court is seised&#8221;. Article 13.1 provides: &#8220;where a child&#8217;s habitual residence cannot be established and jurisdiction cannot be determined on the basis of article 12 [prorogation], the courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction.&#8221; It is accepted by the mother that the courts of England and Wales currently have jurisdiction in this matter.</p>

There is nothing in either the preparatory report by Professor Algeria Borras prior to  the passing of the regulation nor in the Practice Guide published by the European Commission to suggest that it was intended to determine jurisdiction for disputes arising within Member States. The orthodox view has recently been approved by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re W-B (Family Jurisdiction: Appropriate Jurisdiction within the UK)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/592" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 592" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 592</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 1 FLR 394" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 1 FLR 394</ref>. That case concerned a private law dispute between a mother living in Scotland and a father in England.

Before the Court of Appeal (Thorpe, Hughes and McFarlane LJ), all parties maintained that agreement, and McFarlane LJ observed (at para 10):</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Notwithstanding this clear statement of principle, Miss Victoria Green submits on behalf of the mother that article 15 can be used to facilitate the transfer of proceedings between England and Scotland where the court is satisfied that the provisions of the article are satisfied. She submits that the combined effect of articles 2 and 66(c) is that, in countries involving more than one territorial unit, references to a &#8220;court of a Member State&#8221; mean the court of a territorial unit and that, as a result, article 15 includes transfers between different territorial units. She submits that the power to stay proceedings under jurisdictional rules under the residual domestic law set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.5</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> (which come into consideration when BIIR does not apply) is not available in public law proceedings since the rules under that statute only apply to applications for a &#8220;Part 1 order&#8221; as defined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref>, a definition which only extends to certain private law orders. Miss Green submits that it would be illogical for there to be a power to transfer proceedings between EU Member States (such as between the UK and Slovakia, as in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re T</span>, supra, or between Ireland and the UK, as in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re LM</span>, supra) but not between the different territorial units within the UK. </p>

The authors accept that the orthodox view is that national law supplements the allocation by BIIR of jurisdiction to the courts of Member States and determines the allocation of jurisdiction as between their territorial units. They suggest, however, that &#8220;it is &#8230; certainly arguable that effect of article 66 (c) is that any reference to a court of a Member State must be read as a reference to a court of a territorial unit within that State which is concerned&#8221; and that &#8220;there is a strong case for saying that the Council Regulation operates to allocate jurisdiction as between England and Scotland and between similar territorial units in other Member States&#8221;. </p>

If, as article 66(a) requires, the phrase &#8220;habitual residence in a territorial unit&#8221; is substituted for &#8220;habitual residence in a Member State&#8221; in, for example, article 8, it could be argued that the phrase &#8220;the courts of a Member State&#8221; must therefore mean &#8220;the courts of a territorial unit of a Member State&#8221;.

Both the local authority and the children&#8217;s guardian oppose any stay or transfer. There are at present no care proceedings in Scotland, and no suggestion that any local authority there is minded to start proceedings. This family was largely unknown to social services in Scotland before the move to London in February. The <span style="font-style:italic">substance</span> of the dispute between the mother and social services arose in England when the mother allegedly abandoned the children. The position in this case is therefore very different from the situation in both <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re T</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re LM. </span> In each of those cases, the authorities in the country to which the case was transferred (Slovakia in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re T</span>, England and Wales in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re LM</span>) had been heavily involved before the mothers moved to the other jurisdiction. .</p>

Any attempt to initiate the article 15 procedure, or any other process of staying these proceedings, to await proceedings in Scotland, would involve a delay which would be harmful to the children&#8217;s interests. The children are at present settled in foster care and at local schools. Their interests will be best served by the English court reaching a speedy conclusion as to whether the s.31 threshold criteria are satisfied and then determining the orders to be made. As part of that process, the court will of course consider the prospects for family placement, or alternatively a placement of the children outside the family with alternative carers either in England or Scotland. In that context, the mother would be well advised to return to England over the next few weeks so that she can resume contact with the girls and participate in the assessments.</p>
