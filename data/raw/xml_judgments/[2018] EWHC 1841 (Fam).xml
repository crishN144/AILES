	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am required to determine an application by a local authority for permission to withdraw care proceedings in respect of five children, A born in 2003, B born in 2005, C born in 2006, D born in 2009, and E born in 2011. By reason of separate proceedings in the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division, there is an anonymity order in force which prevents the identification of the father, the mother and the children. I am also required to determine an application by the mother, supported by the father, that the local authority should pay their costs from 4 May 2018 to day four of this hearing, 28 June 2018. That application was opposed by the local authority. I record that the children&#8217;s guardian adopted a neutral stance with respect to both the application for permission to withdraw and for costs.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application by the local authority for permission to withdraw the care proceedings was not resisted by any of the parties and I am quite satisfied that I should give permission. Given the circumstances of this case, it is appropriate that I give a judgment setting out the court&#8217;s reasons for granting permission. I have read the evidence filed and served in these proceedings over the course of two days and I have also viewed video material relevant to the activities of the parents. Finally, I have had the benefit of detailed position statements from the local authority, the mother and the father. The children&#8217;s guardian did not file a detailed position statement as he adopted a neutral stance in respect of the facts the local authority sought to prove.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The hearing listed before me was a fact-finding hearing with a time estimate of 12 days. Days one and two were set aside for judicial reading. When the parties attended on day three, I sought to ascertain from the local authority the evidence upon which it relied to establish the link between what were said to be extremist, radical beliefs held by the parents and the feared harm to the children, whether actual or likely. During the course of that exercise, it became apparent that, contrary to the most recent version of its threshold document, the local authority was no longer asserting that the children <span style="font-weight:bold">had</span> suffered significant harm attributable to their parents&#8217; care and now stated that the children <span style="font-weight:bold">were likely to</span> suffer significant harm attributable to their parents&#8217; care. Given that shift in the local authority&#8217;s position, I observed that I doubted whether the evidence I had read would establish the necessary connection between the facts asserted by the local authority and the likelihood of risk to the children. I allowed the local authority time to consider its position in the light of my comments.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On day four of the hearing the local authority indicated in an email sent to me and circulated to the parties that it intended to withdraw its application for care orders in respect of all the children, subject to there being a robust agreement between the parents and the local authority as to the way forward particularly with respect to Child A. At that point, it was not able to file a formal document to that effect as the same was under consideration by senior managers. Regrettably, Child A&#8217;s particular circumstances meant that it was necessary for the parties to attend before me on days five and seven of the listed hearing. On day eight I was able to conclude these proceedings by giving the local authority permission to withdraw the applications for care orders with respect to all five children. I also heard oral argument about the application for a costs order on days seven and eight.</p>

This judgment also explains my decision to refuse the parents&#8217; application that the local authority should pay their costs from 4 May 2018 up 28 June 2018.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applications for care orders arose out of an alleged risk to the children arising from what were said to be the parents&#8217; alleged extremist beliefs and the father being the subject of a Terrorist Prevention and Investigation Measure [&#8220;TPIM&#8221;] since June 2016. That order expired shortly before this hearing. I note that the father is due to stand trial for breaches of the TPIM later this year. The parents separated in 2013 and all the children lived with the mother until Child A left her mother&#8217;s care to live with her father in May 2015.</p>

He refused an application by the local authority for the disclosure of a psychiatric report on the father (though indicated the local authority&#8217;s application in this respect might be restored on 48 hours&#8217; notice to the father) and for the disclosure of various statements, including those made by the father.</p>

It required the father to live at some considerable distance from the children and from his extended family. The father is seeking permission to appeal the decision of Nicol J though I understand that there is no challenge to the findings of fact found by that judge.  In these proceedings, the father submitted that Nicol J&#8217;s findings could not bind this court as the evidential substratum on which those findings were based was simply not available to me. He asserted that he did not hold radical or extreme views of the sort attributed to him and that there was no evidence that the children had been harmed by any beliefs he and/or the mother might have.

The extremist and radicalised views expressed during meetings of the Women&#8217;s Circle were featured in the Channel 4 documentary <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Isis: The British Women Supporters Unveiled&#8221;</span> [&#8220;the ISIS Women Supporters&#8221;].

She submitted that the local authority insinuated she had been radicalised by her association with women whose husbands had been convicted of offences. Above all, she maintained that there was no evidence the children had been taught the views that the local authority contended the parents held or have held in the past. There was further no evidence that the children had been affected negatively by any extreme political or religious views, even if the local authority were able to satisfy the court that the mother had been radicalised.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There has been periodic and intermittent contact between the family and the local authority since December 2005. Some of the referrals concerned (a) allegations of domestic abuse made by the mother against the father; (b) mental health crises concerning both parents; (c) and the mother&#8217;s concerns about Child A&#8217;s alleged difficult behaviour. The first referral to the local authority in connection with the parents&#8217; alleged radical/extremist beliefs was made in July 2015 when the father was said to be under investigation for &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">terror offences</span>&#8221;. In November 2015 the local authority received notification from the police that the mother had been identified as one of the women participating in the ISIS Women Supporters&#8217; documentary. Following these referrals, the local authority conducted an investigation pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/47" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.47</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. However, it alleged that the parents had failed to cooperate with that assessment. The four younger children were made subject to child protection plans in respect of emotional abuse in December 2015. At this time, Child A was living with her father in another local authority and that local authority also completed a child and family assessment. Throughout 2016, the local authority bringing these proceedings sought without success to engage the family in anti-radicalisation work. It was also apparent that, in summer 2016, Child A had been seen by mental health professionals as a result of difficulties between her and her mother. With her father, Child A moved in September 2016 to live in the area of a yet another local authority. </p>

No interim public law orders were made at the first hearing before Cobb J on 2 May 2017 and none have been made subsequently. The local authority in whose area Child A had been living since September 2016 [&#8220;the second local authority&#8221;] issued proceedings in relation to Child A in July 2017. Those proceedings were consolidated with the existing proceedings concerning the four younger children. The matter was set down for a fact-finding hearing in January 2018 with a time estimate of 10 days. From 22 November 2017, I have been the allocated judge responsible for the case management of these proceedings.</p>

The fact-finding hearing listed for January 2018 had to be abandoned on 22 November 2017 because the mother was in hospital and required surgical treatment. She was simply in no position to give instructions so that the January 2018 hearing could be effective. In those circumstances I listed the matter for the next available ten day slot before me which was in June 2018. I also record that in March 2018 the local authority agreed to be the designated local authority in respect of Child A and that I discharged the second local authority as a party to the proceedings. At the March 2018 hearing, I refused an application for an interim care order in respect of Child A whose parents were agreed that she should be placed in foster care under the framework of an agreement pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. That placement in foster care arose because Child A&#8217;s home with her father had come to an end in the autumn of 2017 and she had been temporarily living with relatives and not attending school, in circumstances where neither of her parents were able to offer her a stable home.</p>

My order recorded that the court required the local authority to give careful consideration to its threshold document and to consider, in particular, (i) the relevance of historic domestic violence allegations; (ii) the evidential foundation for any allegation in relation to school attendance/non-attendance by the children; and (iii) the causal connection between any finding sought and the harm suffered and/or likely to be suffered by any of the children given the observations made by the President of the Family Division in the case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re A (Application for Care and Placement Orders: Local Authority Failings)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2015/11" uk:canonical="[2015] EWFC 11" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWFC 11</ref>.

The information in the social work statement was underscored by the contents of the local authority documents generated prior to the issue of proceedings.

Sometimes the linkage will be obvious, as where the facts proved establish physical harm. But the linkage may be very much less obvious where the allegation is only that the child is at risk of suffering emotional harm or, as in the present case, at risk of suffering neglect. In the present case, as we shall see, an important element of the local authority&#8217;s case was that the father &#8220;lacks honesty with professionals&#8221;, &#8220;minimises matters of importance&#8221; and &#8220;is immature and lacks insight of issues of importance&#8221;. May be. But how does this feed through into a conclusion that A is at risk of neglect? The conclusion does not follow naturally from the premise.

Given the process I undertook on day three of the hearing and the forensic difficulties I highlighted to the local authority, I am more than satisfied that the local authority should be given permission to withdraw its proceedings in respect of all five of the children.

Though those findings could not bind this court, Mr Rowley QC on behalf of the father acknowledged that those findings stood. I was told that the father&#8217;s application for permission to appeal Nicol J&#8217;s decision &#8211; as yet undetermined &#8211; did not seek to challenge the findings of fact made by Nicol J. Thus, I am persuaded that, with respect to the father, it would have been open to the court to make findings consistent with those made by Nicol J summarised at paragraph 11 above. As with the father in the case before Macdonald J [<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A Local Authority v X, Y and Z (Permission to Withdraw)</span>], this would place the father in a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">very small cohort of individuals against whom exceptional measures are deemed to be required</span>&#8221; [56].</p>

Though she had a caution for an assault committed in the presence of the children, this was unrelated to her alleged extremist beliefs. Her position was thus appreciably different to that of the father. The mother accepted that she had attended meetings of the Women&#8217;s Circle but denied that this was affiliated to ALM or that she held extremist views. She accepted that, occasionally, children might enter the room where the Women&#8217;s Circle was meeting but this was not intentional or encouraged.  Standing back and evaluating all of the material I have read, I have concluded that it might have been possible for the court to make findings about the mother&#8217;s extremist beliefs but that outcome was far less certain than the findings sought by the local authority in relation to the father. </p>

On the contrary, there was an absence of any evidence that the children had been significantly harmed by their parent&#8217;s alleged extremist and radicalised beliefs. There was certainly no proper evidential basis to put to the parents in cross-examination that they had radicalised their children; that their children shared their extremist beliefs; or that the children had been coached to disguise the true position in the family home. The threshold for establishing that significant harm had been suffered by any of the children simply could not have been crossed on the evidence before the court.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the risk of significant harm, my conclusion is the same. Given that the local authority could point to no evidence of the children having suffered significant emotional harm, the local authority would, in my view, have been unable to achieve a finding that there was a risk of significant harm on the evidence before the court. What was required to establish the likelihood of significant harm was a <span style="font-weight:bold">real possibility</span>, a possibility that could not sensibly be ignored having regard to the nature and gravity of the feared harm [<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H and Others (Child Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 1 FLR 80" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 1 FLR 80</ref>]. As Mr Rowley QC put it in paragraph 9 of his position statement dated 26 June 2018, the father had held his beliefs for the entirety of the children&#8217;s lives and in 15 years Child A had suffered no harm thereby. There was no inductively reasoned basis for concluding that the future for these children would not resemble the past. </p>

In my view, those additional provisions were equally unlikely to satisfy the threshold criteria. For example, though Child A was not in a school setting for an extended period, it was doubtful that she was being &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">kept out of education</span>&#8221; by her parents. The evidence was that the father was providing her with appropriate home schooling and was engaged with efforts to source suitable formal schooling provision. Likewise, there was no evidence that the parents had repeatedly told Child A that she was mentally unwell given that the local authority could only point to a single instance in the case of each parent of the use by them of an undoubtedly negative comment to Child A. Finally, the restrictions imposed by virtue of the TPIM were not attributable to the care given to Child A by her father not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to her and thus could not satisfy the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.31(2)</ref> attributability condition. I observe that, during these proceedings, it had not been suggested either by the local authority or by the second local authority that Child A should not live with the father in consequence of the TPIM conditions which had, in any event, now lapsed.</p>

Though no parameters defining the extent of the costs order sought by the mother were set out in that document, Miss Fottrell QC confirmed during the course of submissions that she sought an order requiring the local authority to pay the mother&#8217;s publicly funded costs from 5 May 2018 [this being the day after the directions hearing on 4 May 2018 when the local authority was required to give careful consideration to the contents of its threshold document] until the date upon which the local authority indicated that it would apply for permission to withdraw the proceedings [day four of the hearing, 28 June 2018]. Mr Rowley QC confirmed the same position was advanced by the father.

I permitted each parent a further 7 days to prepare and file such a document and gave the local authority an opportunity to respond in writing within the following five days.

It is a serious misfortune to be the subject of unjustified allegations in relation to misconduct to a child but where it is reasonable that these should be investigated by a court, justice does not demand that the local authority responsible for placing the allegations before the court should ultimately be responsible for the legal costs of the person against whom the allegations are made.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I set these out in summary form. Both Miss Fottrell QC and Mr Rowley QC submitted that, given the ambit of the costs order for which they contended, my focus should properly be on the local authority&#8217;s conduct between 5 May and 28 June 2018. Both relied on the local authority&#8217;s abandonment, during the course of the process I undertook on day three of the hearing, of its case that the children had been significantly harmed by reason of their parents&#8217; beliefs contrary to what was stated in its opening note and its threshold document, as an example both of insufficient analysis by the local authority of its overall case and thereby unreasonable conduct. Having been invited by the court on 4 May 2018 to consider the causal connection between any finding sought and the harm suffered or likely to be suffered, the local authority simply failed to do so in circumstances where (a) there was no evidence that the children had actually been harmed and (b) where Child A had not suffered the alleged harm during 15 years of care by her parents. Further, the local authority&#8217;s application for permission to withdraw was made on an evidential foundation which was essentially unchanged since 4 May 2018. The Court&#8217;s exchanges with counsel for the local authority on day three of the hearing had forced the local authority to an analysis and an appraisal of its case which it should have engaged in prior to the start of the hearing. In essence, the local authority had been unreasonable in seeking to assert a case which it could never have proved. </p>

Both were highly critical of what they considered to be the tendentious tone adopted in the local authority&#8217;s documents. Thus, for example, the local authority&#8217;s opening note at paragraph 71 asserted that the parents had obstructed the child protection system during the involvement of three local authorities. The comprehensive schedule of local authority involvement prepared on behalf of the mother indicated that, on the dates noted, the mother was considered repeatedly by the local authority to have been co-operative. Largely the same observations were applied at the time to the father&#8217;s involvement with the local authority. Put simply, the overall presentation of the local authority&#8217;s case was founded on assertion rather than proper analysis of the evidence available to the court.</p>

In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A Local Authority v X, Y and Z (Permission to Withdraw)</span>, Macdonald J had come to the view that the local authority would have been unable to satisfy the threshold criteria whereas in another case Pauffley J had refused a local authority permission to withdraw the proceedings but, having heard the evidence, had decided that the threshold criteria were not made out [<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re C (A Child: Application for Dismissal or Withdrawal of Proceedings) (No. 3)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2017/37" uk:canonical="[2017] EWFC 37" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWFC 37</ref>].

As I have already made clear, the local authority has an obligation to scrutinise the evidence underpinning its threshold case. Each case is intensely fact specific so analogies with other reported decisions concerning parents with alleged extremist beliefs are, in my view, of very limited value. There is no substitute for a careful and thorough analysis by the local authority before it decides whether to pursue its threshold case to a hearing. </p>

Addressing one of Miss Kirby&#8217;s complaints about the conduct of the parents, the mother failed to comply with the court&#8217;s direction to file her response to the local authority&#8217;s threshold document as directed on 26 March 2018 but did so on 13 April 2018 at the same time as she filed her detailed statement. The mother&#8217;s failure to respond as directed to the threshold document, whilst undesirable, was not fundamental in circumstances where the local authority comprehensively revised its threshold document on 8 June 2018. The other criticisms made by the local authority of the parents, such as the father&#8217;s objections to the disclosure of the TPIM conditions and the parents&#8217; witness requirements being notified/amended either late or unreasonably, did not amount in my view to problematic litigation conduct weighing decisively in the balance against the making of a costs order. To assert that, if the parents had co-operated, the proceedings need not have taken so long implied rather that the parents were being unreasonable in &#8211; as is their right - seeking to contest the threshold case advanced by the local authority. Indeed, Miss Kirby&#8217;s suggestion that I should look at the parties&#8217; conduct throughout the proceedings represented something of a double-edged submission for the local authority given that the advocates for both parents had been saying from the inception of the proceedings that the local authority could not establish its threshold case.</p>

In its threshold document dated 8 June 2018, the local authority abandoned any reliance on historic domestic violence allegations or school attendance/non-attendance as matters capable of establishing the threshold criteria.  Thus, the local authority had done what it had been asked to do and had reflected upon the relevance of two of the matters listed in my order. Though I concluded, in giving permission to withdraw, that the local authority&#8217;s analysis of the nexus between parental beliefs and behaviour and actual/likely harm was inadequate, I am reluctant to hold that it was unreasonable for the local authority to pursue its threshold case from 5 May 2018 onwards.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Firstly, the local authority had reconsidered its position following the exchanges in court on day three of the hearing and had indicated on day four of the hearing its intention to apply for permission to withdraw its applications for public law orders in respect of all the children. Thus, this was not a case in which the local authority had embarked on a hearing and realised, during the course of the witness evidence, that its threshold case was incapable of being established. In addition, the circumstances of this case were very different indeed to the wholesale and significant failings identified of the local authorities in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Coventry City Council v X, Y and Z (Care Proceedings: Costs)</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re R (Care: Disclosure: Nature of Proceedings)</span>. Secondly, though the local authority came to a faulty analysis of its threshold case despite my direction on 4 May 2018, it would not be the first or the last local authority &#8211; or indeed, party - to recognise at a late stage that either its threshold case or other aspects of its case were untenable. To visit costs on a local authority in such circumstances would be akin to saying that any change of mind by a party during the course of children litigation was an admission of past error requiring a punitive response from the court. As a matter of public policy, such a stance by the court would render unreasonable the finely balanced judgments many local authorities have to take both before and during children litigation and undermine the general proposition that an order for costs is unusual in such proceedings. Finally, I observe that the local authority responded appropriately to the observations I made in court on day three of the hearing, thereby giving effect to its obligation, pursuant to Rule 1.1(3) of the FPR, to help the court further the overriding objective set out in Rule 1.1(1) of dealing with cases justly, having regard to any welfare issues involved.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to consider CPR Rule 44.2(5)(c), namely the manner in which a party has pursued or defended its case or a particular allegation or issue. The parents criticised the local authority&#8217;s documents as demonstrating a confused approach to the evidence and relying on assertions which were not translated into its threshold documents. Thus, for example, in paragraph 28 of its opening note the local authority asserted that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the way in which the children are being brought up by their parents puts them at risk of being subjected to terrorism measures, imprisonment and death</span>&#8221;, a proposition which Mr Rowley QC described as wholly unsubstantiated by the evidence and barely comprehensible. The criticism of the local authority documents was well made. The assertions made did not stand even preliminary scrutiny by the court given that the local authority, during the exchanges in court on day three, managed to contradict the contents of its own threshold document by asserting it no longer relied on past harm to establish its threshold case. The local authority&#8217;s muddled thinking about an inherently weak case translated into confused and overly tendentious documents which tried to justify - despite the evidence to the contrary &#8211; its prosecution of this case. It is fortunate that the local authority reconsidered its stance before the evidence began. However, I am not persuaded that this ground alone would justify a costs order even though I recognise that the parents will have been upset by the way in which the local authority presented its opening position.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given that CPR Rule 44.2(5)(d) is not applicable in the context of this case, my analysis of the specific factors set out in Rule 44.2(5) and of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">all the circumstances</span>&#8221; [Rule 44.2(4)] does not support the making of a costs order against the local authority. I emphasise that the application made by Miss Fottrell QC and Mr Rowley QC was neither misconceived nor was it a long shot. There was much here in the local authority&#8217;s conduct to scrutinise with great care. Nevertheless, a costs order, even in the limited sum contended for, would have been unjust. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I make one final observation. Miss Kirby criticised the parents for failing to file a costs schedule prior to their application. That was a point well made because it is difficult to see how a court could come to a decision about costs in these circumstances without knowing the amount at stake. The amount of costs sought must form part of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">all the circumstances</span>&#8221; referred to in Rule 44.2(4) otherwise it is difficult to see how the court can come to a decision on what is just in the circumstances of a particular case [FPR Rule 28.1]. Thus, I disagree with Miss Fottrell QC that a decision on costs in cases of this sort can be made on principle without full knowledge of the sum involved. Before coming to my decision, I directed a process whereby each parent could provide a schedule of costs after I had heard their submissions and gave an opportunity for the local authority to comment thereon.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unfortunately, neither Rule 28 of the FPR nor the provisions of the CPR make clear how a party in children proceedings, whether publicly funded or not, is to place information about the costs it seeks before the court. Practice Direction 44 to CPR Rule 44 contains, in section nine, general provisions about summary assessment of costs, a procedure available to the court - as paragraph 9.2(b) makes clear - &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">at the conclusion of any other hearing, which has lasted not more than one day, in which case the order will deal with the costs of the application or matter to which the hearing related. If this hearing disposes of the claim, the order may deal with the costs of the whole claim</span>&#8221;. That summary process did not appear to be applicable in this case though I note that, in the context of a financial remedies case, Sir Peter Singer held that the power to make a summary assessment was not confined to a case listed for one day or less nor to cases involving modest amounts [<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Thiry v Thiry</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/4046" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 4046 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 4046 (Fam)</ref>]. That case had been listed for five days but had concluded within a day, the husband declining to be present or represented.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The provisions of paragraph 9.5 of Practice Direction 44 which provide for a schedule of costs to be prepared by the party claiming costs appear only to apply to the process for summary assessment. Until such time as there is revision or amendment of costs provisions in children proceedings, I suggest a pragmatic approach is adopted by those seeking to claim costs, whether publicly funded or not. They should prepare a schedule in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9.5 of CPR PD 44 which incidentally would give the local authority not less than 24 hours before the hearing to consider this document. By that route, the court would have the necessary information available to it to make a just decision without the requirement for the claiming party to prepare a comprehensive and detailed schedule of costs such as is otherwise required for a detailed or comprehensive assessment. </p>
