	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in">P is now just over 16 years of age. With the consent of her mother she has been accommodated under s.20 of the Children act 1989 since October 2013. In February 2014 the local authority issued care proceedings. At the final hearing of the care proceedings I concluded that P&#8217;s best welfare interests required that she be made a ward of court. An issue now arises concerning the arrangements for her present care. The local authority has applied to the court for a secure accommodation order. There is an issue as to the court&#8217;s power to make a secure accommodation order given that the application was issued shortly after P&#8217;s 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday. This judgment relates to that issue.</p>

With the consent of the parties the application for a secure accommodation order has been adjourned generally with liberty to restore. For reasons which will become clear later in this judgment, the local authority remains concerned that it may in due course find itself in a position in which it considers it necessary to proceed with the application for a secure accommodation order as a matter of urgency. I agreed, therefore, to address the issue of jurisdiction at this stage.</p>

That telephone call led to the beginning of multi-agency involvement with P and her family. Over the course of the next six months P&#8217;s behaviours included frequent self-harming, threats to kill herself and running away from home. Following the mother&#8217;s agreement to P being accommodated by the local authority, P was placed with foster carers. </p>

She was seen by a psychiatrist and by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (&#8216;CAMHS&#8217;). She remained in her local hospital until a specialist bed became available. As there were no specialist beds available locally she was placed in a unit more than 100 miles from her home. She was admitted as a voluntary patient.</p>

Whilst this clusters into a number of diagnostic groups of emotional disorders (obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, recurrent depressive disorder) and psychotic disorders, most of them do not reach formal diagnostic criteria. The cumulative impact on P&#8217;s emotional and social functioning on a day to day basis is however significant and very impairing indeed. He psychosocial disability as a result is moderate to severe&#8230;There are at this stage two clusters that are more convincing in terms of diagnostic validity. These are emerging borderline personality disorder (a form of an emotionally unstable personality disorder) and post-traumatic stress disorder.&#8217;</p>

The pattern is present by early adulthood, usually emerges in adolescence, and occurs across a variety of situations and contexts. Because a personality disorder is a pervasive, enduring and inflexible pattern of maladaptive inner experiences and pathological behaviour, there is a general reluctance to diagnose personality disorders before adolescence or early adulthood. However, without early treatment symptoms may worsen. Hence early recognition of this pattern is very important.&#8217;</p>

Concerns about P&#8217;s behaviour led to her being transferred to a more secure unit. P made progress. In February 2015 she was transferred to a &#8216;step-down&#8217; facility with a view to her ultimate discharge from hospital.

P is a vulnerable young person and due to the risk of absconding, when she is likely to suffer significant harm or injure herself, I would recommend that the Court considers a Secure Accommodation Order (Section 25 of the Children&#8217;s Act 1999 (sic)) for P.&#8217;</p>

It is clear that there are major problems with access to Tier 4 inpatient services, with children and young people's safety being compromised while they wait, suffering from severe mental health problems, for an inpatient bed to become available. In some cases they will need to wait at home, in other cases in a general paediatric ward, or even in some instances in an adult psychiatric ward or a police cell. Often when beds are found they may be in distant parts of the country, making contact with family and friends difficult, and leading to longer stays.&#8217;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in">Those observations appear to make two points. Firstly, that there is an important distinction between <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20(3)</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20(5)</ref>, the former creating a duty upon a local authority to accommodate a child over the age of 16 and the latter giving a local authority a discretion to accommodate a child between the ages of 16 and 21. Secondly, that the restriction imposed by reg 5(2) of the Children (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 1991 applies to a child accommodated under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20(5)</ref> but not to a child accommodated under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20(3)</ref>.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.63in">&#8216;11. &#8230;at the start of the argument today I questioned whether C should be regarded as a child who was being provided with accommodation in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in">In my judgment it is clear that the restrictions imposed by reg. 5(2) on making a secure accommodation order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref> in respect of a child over the age of 16 are limited to children who are accommodated as a matter of discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20(5)</ref> and do not extend to children who are accommodated as a matter of duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20(3)</ref>. Where a looked-after child aged between 16 and 18 is accommodated under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> the court has the power to make her the subject of a secure accommodation order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref>. It follows, therefore, that in this circumstances of this case it is appropriate that the local authority&#8217;s application for a secure accommodation order be adjourned generally with liberty to restore should circumstances arise in which it considers it appropriate to do so.</p>
