The Local Authority, under the guidance of Mr Downs of Counsel, has made very extensive efforts to see what information could be found about Jade.  Six weeks ago a public campaign was approved and then launched which set out the background history of the case.  The objective was to reach the widest possible audience.  The campaign identified the child as Jade.  In addition the initial inquiry had produced material which led the Local Authority to conclude that she might have the surname Alma or Nakabugo.  This information was included in the public campaign.  At that stage the best guess as to her age was that she was 19 months old.  A photograph was also disclosed into the public domain as well as a short summary of Jade&#8217;s character and personality.  </span></p>

She makes a sensible observation that in years to come there may be some crumb of comfort for Jade when her attention is directed to the press articles which have been generated by the search for her parents and which set out the extent of the efforts that have been made to discover her true origins. </span></p>

Strict procedural compliance is essential.  Further, I should add that I have delivered this short extempore judgment in Open Court with the Press present. I have done this in order to grasp a further opportunity to identify the parents and to signal the nature of the very important orders I am making in respect of this child.</span></p>
