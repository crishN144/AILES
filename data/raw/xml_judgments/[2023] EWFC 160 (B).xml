	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The applicant applies to the Court to vary a periodical payments term found in a consent order dated 26 March 2019 (&#8220;the 2019 order&#8221;) [22] under which he is liable to pay to the respondent maintenance each month at the rate of &#163;1,500 per month until 28 March 2027 when it will reduce to &#163;1,250 per month and then to 28 March 2036 when the obligation will terminate with a clean break and a section 28 bar preventing any extension to the term. The logic for such change is argued to relate to (a) the respondent&#8217;s relationship with a cohabitee and (b) to a purported earning capacity on the part of the respondent beyond that accepted by her. The applicant argues the maintenance should be reduced immediately to &#163;625 per month (backdated to the date of the application with a repayment of sums overpaid to date) and then should end in 3 years&#8217; time. He originally argued for a reduction to &#163;500 per month but has recalculated the same in the light of a separate reduction in child support (see below). He originally argued that the clean break should be brought forward from 2036 to 2026 but now accepts a clean break should not be brought forward. The respondent disagrees with the applicant and argues for the continuation of the existing order save that she will give credit for any benefits received after the date of the hearing. I have considered the papers contained within the hearing bundle; the live evidence of the parties and the respondent&#8217;s fiancee (&#8220;the cohabitee&#8221;) and the submissions made by counsel for each party. Within this judgment I will not deal with every piece of evidence or reference every argument made but I have kept it all in mind when reaching this judgment.</span></p>

It seems agreed the respondent was not open to this suggestion. Plainly the maintenance was not varied as part of the 2021 order. In April 2022, the applicant made this application [35]. Remarkably this is the first time on which the parties have been before the Court. As such it has taken the best part of 18 months for their application to come to final hearing. This is a particular shame given the issues are relatively narrow and the facts far from complex. Previously the Court approved directions agreed by the parties on paper and a listed hearing had to be vacated due to judicial availability. The applicant has applied for the appointment of an expert (occupational health physician) to provide an opinion on the employability of the respondent. This was refused by the Court on a paper consideration requested by the parties [65].</span></p>

There is separate provision which permits the Court to order a capitalised lump sum or other appropriate transfer to enable such a clean break (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>(7B)).

The respondent argued the relevant order was the 2021 order and by that time the role of the cohabitee was well known. Notwithstanding this within the same order the maintenance was maintained without change. It was therefore not possible to contend that the issue of cohabitation was in any way a change of circumstance from the date of this order. The applicant disagreed suggesting the focus was on the 2019 order and that the point of cohabitation was not a &#8216;use it or lose it&#8217; point in 2021. In any event the applicant had in fact raised the cohabitation in 2021 but it had been put to one side so as to resolve the pressing issue of the property. For the respondent it was said the Judge&#8217;s approval of this order was on all matters including the maintenance. For the applicant it was said this belied the reality of the situation in which the focus of the 2021 order was on resolving the housing issue.</span></p>

Whilst acknowledging the respondent&#8217;s undoubted health issues it was said these are not such as to rule employment out entirely and particularly so given the applicant sets earning capacity at a modest level of under &#163;10,000 per annum. The applicant pointed to job adverts as suggestive of the options available to the respondent and noted reference to such points being &#8216;disability aware.&#8217; The implication of the applicant&#8217;s argument was that the respondent was electing not to work whilst receiving maintenance.

It was pointed out that these conditions had been present throughout the marriage and the applicant was well aware of the implications of the same. The fact the respondent had successfully raised five children did not change this reality. These were conditions which deteriorated over time and the applicant was poorly placed to assess the extent to which the respondent was impacted on a daily basis. The respondent told me about how she was affected and explained this left her fatigued and unable to offer reliable availability for any employment. She would rather this was not the case but it was a fact of her life. The fact that the children were now older did not make her any more available to carry out paid work.

The respondent and cohabitee appear to have formed their relationship in early 2020 and they have now been living together for 3 years. The cohabitee made a significant financial contribution to reduce the mortgage (see above) to preserve the home for the respondent. The cohabitee claims to input &#163;1,068 per month into the family budget. He plays a supportive role for the respondent and helps with the children and grandchildren. The respondent/cohabitee are engaged since March 2021 but deny any plans to marry or any concerted effort to avoid marriage so as to prolong maintenance. He told me that he has borrowed off family to help the respondent with her legal costs. The cohabitee provided a statement and set out his budgetary demands which include some level of support to his own children. He claims a net income of about &#163;2,600pcm and spending needs almost equal to this. Of his spending needs &#163;1,068 are paid into the household (41%). A further 21% of his income goes towards his own property, which is rented and provides part of his net income. This leaves him a little under &#163;1,000pcm for his personal spending. He noted that recently the mortgage on the property came off a fixed period and went up by about &#163;300. As the respondent cannot afford this, he has met this additional sum.

On day one of the cohabitation the circumstances may be markedly different from how the relationship exists on day one hundred. Relationships can of course wax and wane and commitment is often a developing emotion. As such it would be foolish to identify a specific point at which a change has to be raised if it is to be examined by the court. I agree it is wrong to suggest there is a &#8216;use it or lose it&#8217; principle in play.

Whilst I accept, in approving the order the Judge was approving an order which included a paragraph which referenced the continuation of the maintenance obligation, I consider it is highly artificial to suggest this amounts to a resetting of the maintenance obligation. I doubt very much either party would have explained the purpose of the order in those terms if asked at the time.

Furthermore, where in such an assessment are the attitudes and opinions of the cohabitee? A party may choose not to marry to maintain maintenance but this does not automatically demonstrate that but for this the cohabitee would be open to marriage.

In my assessment I do not doubt the authenticity of the minutes but I gauge they must be taken as a snapshot rather than a guaranteed conclusion as to what the future holds. After all there are good grounds for believing the 2019 consent order was founded upon the remuneration package in place at that time yet, over the following three years it provided a poor indication of the actual remuneration received by the applicant. In any event there is force in the point that the applicant agreed the terms of the 2019 order when his finances were set at a similar level to that noted in the minutes. Furthermore, at that time it is not at all clear that any account was taken of his now-wife&#8217;s resources. Finally, in examination he did not resist the suggestion that the maintenance remained affordable. I accept the point that the maintenance is globally set at about 50% of his net income if he earns around &#163;100,000, however that was the position in 2019 and if nothing else changes this will be automatically addressed as child support falls to &#163;850 at the end of this month and then terminates in summer 2026 followed by maintenance reducing to &#163;1,250 the following year. At that point if nothing else changes global maintenance will have fallen to 25% of likely net income with the gross contribution falling from &#163;2,450 to &#163;1,250. I also note in the interim period between 2019 and this application the maintenance obligation has been substantially eased by reason of the applicant&#8217;s income exceeding the levels of 2019. This will have provided the applicant with an opportunity to save against future uncertainty.</span></p>

Cohabitation can come in many shapes and forms and the mutual obligation between the parties to a relationship can differ significantly. I have reached my conclusion starting from the position taken by the respondent. She told me that she and the cohabitee became engaged to signify their commitment to each other. It is this commitment that is of relevance when assessing the relevance of the relationship to issues of maintenance. I have no reason to question the evidence of the respondent that she has not formed an intention to remarry nor consciously held this off to maintain support from the applicant. In reality and for the reasons set out above with respect to &#8216;conduct&#8217; I am far from clear this makes any real difference to my assessment. It is noteworthy that both the respondent and cohabitee have been married before and this may provoke in their minds a level of opposition to remarrying. It would seem unrealistic not to expect the respondent to be conscious of the implications to her of getting married (i.e., losing support) but this does not mean this is the operative factor in her decision making. The evidence from the applicant in this regard was based on what &#8216;unnamed&#8217; family members have said to him. This is hardly a foundation for a safe conclusion.</span></p>

I remind myself he has loaned an interest free sum close to &#163;270,000 and has tied the same up until summer 2026. To enable this, he mortgaged his own property. This evidences real commitment. In addition, the respondent and the cohabitee have now lived together for three years in the context of the respondent&#8217;s poor health and the demands of the children from her previous marriage. I heard nothing to suggest their relationship was anything other than strong and stable. The cohabitee provides significant monthly income support and practical help. All the evidence illustrates this flows from his commitment to the respondent and vice versa. Indeed, he has borrowed from his family to enable her to meet her legal fees. In my assessment this relationship has all the hallmarks of a strong and enduring relationship. It is in no way transitory or casual in character. Of course, no one predict the future but at this time the signs are good. I am of the view their mutual commitment will continue and that the cohabitee will continue to provide support to the respondent to the best of his ability. All things being equal I can see no basis for believing this will cease when the time comes to sell the property. In reality this property has become a home for the respondent and her children, but also for the cohabitee who has rented his own property out. In my assessment there is a strong likelihood that these individuals will continue to plan their futures together beyond 2026 and an aspect of this will be mutual planning as to accommodation.</span></p>

It is in my assessment something of an ask on the part of the applicant to expect the cohabitee to take on a second job so that the applicant can be relieved of his maintenance obligations which arose out of a lengthy marriage and which produced five children, two of who are still under eighteen. In any event I accept the cohabitee&#8217;s evidence as to his working history and how he has found himself somewhat unqualified after returning from East Asia in around 2016. I heard nothing in the evidence to suggest that he is not doing his best and appropriately maximising his income. As noted, he has rented out his property as part of this planning and enhanced his income as a result. He might not be working full time but I do not consider it appropriate to calculate on the basis that he should seek a second job as was suggested to him. I should also bear in mind the role he provides in assisting the respondent although I appreciate this feature does depend to an extent on my findings as to the respondent&#8217;s ability to work.</span></p>

I have outlined the level of contribution made by the cohabitee both in financial and non-financial terms. Whilst he contributes 41% of his income into the home directly, I do not lose sight of the fact that he also meets additional expenditure at 21% which reflects the consequences of borrowing to enable the property to be preserved. This is an indirect contribution. This leaves 38% of his income available. Of this he provides an account of how the balance is spent. Now, whilst one might seek to forensically probe this account, I question what the upshot of any probing would be. It cannot be right to argue he should not support his own children in circumstances where the applicant accepts, he continues to support his own adult children in addition to those at home. Why should he not contribute to a pension or have a gym membership? I have to bear in mind the cohabitee is not a party with any responsibility to the applicant in making his own financial choices. Ultimately, I can see how the budget might produce some limited savings (see running car at &#163;250) but I note there is no allowance for holidays or clothing. I am of the clear view the cohabitee is not a realistic source of additional support at this time.</span></p>

I have regard to the issues around the older child&#8217;s engagement with education and struggles but this of itself does not prevent the respondent from pursuing a level of employment. I also accept there are many positives in respect of the respondent. She appears presentable and I am sure is an engaging and interested individual. She may have many characteristics which might attract an employer. The difficulty is her undoubted ill health and the presence of conditions which are associated with deteriorating health. None of this is new to the applicant and it is agreed many of the conditions have been present throughout her adulthood and through the marriage. I appreciate in the marriage the respondent nonetheless held down a significant role as home maker and mother. But the applicant loses sight of the fact she was a younger person then and these are conditions which worsen with age. The respondent is entitled to point to the limited interaction she has had with the applicant in recent times and there is strength in the submission that he simply does not have a clear understanding of how her conditions impact upon her now.</span></p>

The respondent has a right to buy out the applicant&#8217;s interest but importantly the cohabitee is entitled to his monies at that point as well. So, a buyout could only arise in circumstances where the cohabitee left his money in the property and further funds were obtained to fund the applicant&#8217;s interest. On balance this seems an unlikely state of affairs unless the cohabitee was to sell his own property and use these funds to pay to the applicant. What is far more likely is that the property will be sold as anticipated and the proceeds distributed. On current figures the cohabitee would receive his monies &#163;271,000) with the applicant receiving around &#163;195,000 (using a mid point of the values given by the parties&#8217;).

This being the case and absent any other change the respondent should be around &#163;768 per month better off and could therefore require &#163;768 less from the applicant without suffering any hardship.

He does not live in the home free of cost. Whilst this cannot be calculated with exactitude, I suspect it may amount to a significant portion of the &#163;768.

Inflation has been running in excess of 10% in the last year or so. Whilst the maintenance has stayed fixed costs have gone up. I note there has been no change in maintenance since 2019 and I calculate that &#163;2500 (in March 2019) upgraded for inflation would equate to &#163;3,067 (in August 2023 &#8211; see At A Glance Table 6 updated for August 2023: 131.3). This means that just to stand still the respondent would have had to make savings. I appreciate the same point bites equally on the applicant&#8217;s budget. I consider the cohabitee&#8217;s additional contribution has been eaten away by inflation to the point where it is wholly offset. So, I accept the global income coming into the home has increased but that this has been offset by increasing costs with the net effect that the respondent and cohabitee are living at a level just within the available resources. There is no scope for reductions beyond those noted above.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Matters will improve as the mortgage is shed and the opportunity for mortgage free living arises. I understood the evidence of the respondent to confirm that at such point her priority would be to reduce her costs of housing over preserving a larger home. On today&#8217;s information this would reduce the costs by the sum of &#163;1,126 being the current mortgage on the property. On my assessment it is likely the cohabitee will continue to rent his property as the net return on this is a valuable part of his income. He would only likely stop doing this if it were no longer needed. I am therefore not minded to fundamentally change his likely income reducing it to income from employment only. But were I to do that I would then have to set off the current costs on the that property (&#163;558 per month) and attempt some form of calculation as to the likely return on his capital (if as I find they will pool their resources). On the information I have the better assessment is the approach taken at the outset of this paragraph.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">So, in simple terms the respondent/cohabitee will be &#163;1,126 better off. However, matters do not end there as it is reasonable to assume there will be (i) some reduction in living costs associated with this replacement property being smaller than the current home; (ii) it is reasonable to assume the older child will be less dependent as he will be close to twenty-one by this time, and; (iii) generally all of the children will be less reliant on the support they currently receive. In my assessment these points taken together will likely accumulate to reduced needs (taken globally for the respondent/cohabitee with respect to their domestic economy) of around &#163;1,600 per month.  In reaching this figure I allowed &#163;1,126 for the mortgage; &#163;250 per month related to a smaller property and the balance of &#163;226 relating to the child costs. I did not remove children spending altogether having regard to the younger child only just being eighteen at that point; out of respect for the entitlement of the cohabitee to wish to spend on his children and in the light of the evidence of the applicant of continuing to provide some support to his older adult children in any event.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">However, at the same time the respondent will lose her child maintenance entirely. For these purposes I use the figure of &#163;850 per month as I have had regard to the September 2023 loss in the calculations already undertaken above. In the following year she will see her maintenance step down by &#163;250 to &#163;1,250. Together these deductions total &#163;1,100 which has to balance against the &#163;1,600 figure above reducing it to &#163;500 per month. This might justify a reduction of maintenance to &#163;750 per month (whether before but no later than April 2027). In contrast the applicant argues for an immediate reduction of maintenance to &#163;500 now and a cessation of all maintenance as of 2026. For the reasons set out in the narrative and detailed calculations above this is not a maintainable position.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">I have reached the conclusion there is no justification for a phased reduction between summer 2026 and April 2027 and that a single adjustment can appropriately be made. I have reached the conclusion that there should be a single step down on the youngest child leaving secondary education and at that point maintenance should reduce to &#163;750 per month. For these purposes and to avoid any doubt this date shall be no later than 1 September 2026. It will then continue until the operation of the s28 bar in 2036. Pending  the 2026 reduction maintenance shall continue at the current rate. I have considered all the circumstances of the case but have plainly focused on those points which have been primarily placed before me. I accept the concession as to a &#163; for &#163; reduction for any PIP award received.</span></p>
