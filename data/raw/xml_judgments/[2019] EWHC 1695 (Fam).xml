The identity of his biological father is unknown to the court and I shall call him X.  At all times he has believed the mother&#8217;s husband AB to be his father. </p>

The mother resists both the proposal that C should be told that AB is not his father at this stage and that she should be required to disclose X&#8217;s identity.   </p>

The circumstances which led to the affair are irrelevant to my determination.  She says that she was at the time still in a sexual relationship with AB, her husband, and she convinced herself that she was carrying his child.   </p>

That was carried out in December 2018 and both that test and another test carried out the next month confirmed that AB was not the biological father of C.   </p>

C knows no other father.  It is common ground that AB and C are very close (as are CD and C) and their relationship is of huge importance to C.  I treat AB&#8217;s threat of withdrawal from C&#8217;s life as now parked firmly in history.  AB lives abroad and comes to England for about a week a month to see C and spends approaching half the school holidays with C. </p>

Far better, she says to wait for about two years by when he will understand the genetic process.  In the meantime, C can get on and enjoy a full relationship with AB.   </p>

In an ideal world she would hope that the secret of X&#8217;s identity might remain in the background until C approaches adulthood. </p>

At this age, C is still a young child, and whilst he is developing an increased understanding of the world and is more able to understand more complex information, his thinking remains relatively uncomplicated.  Children are better at dealing with life events at this age, because they have a lesser sense of permanency as they tend to live in the moment.  From a cognitive standpoint, the information shared is likely to have less of a devastating impact that if C were older.  He is more likely to overcome initial feelings of shock and distress than if he were entering the pre-teen or teenage stage of development, where the advance of puberty can bring about real emotional turbulence, that would compound any initial emotional response.  Further, an older child is increasingly likely to experience a sense of loss of trust in a parent at not having been told sooner.  </span></p>

I acknowledge once that that should be the guiding principle in all cases with which the court deals.  It has obvious merit, not least the general proposition that truth, at the end of the day is easier to handle than fiction and also it is designed to avoid information coming to a young person&#8217;s attention in a haphazard, unorganised and indeed sometimes malicious context and a court should not depart from that approach unless the best interests of the child compel it so to do.   </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.04in">I am of the clear view that the risk of the mother retaining C in India is very small.  She and C have lived in England throughout their lives.  They are completely settled in England.  Their social status in India is undermined by the fact that her adultery is, within their circle, a known fact.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.04in">Further, at this particular time the financial consequences of the mother not returning with C to England would be very large.  She has a claim for financial remedy orders to be determined by me early next year and if she was in breach of an order to return C that claim would be extremely adversely affected.  The incentive for her to return is higher now than it has ever been, including the three occasions on which she went to India with C last year, namely August, October and December 2018, the last occasion being after the first DNA test results. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.04in">What would the magnitude of risk be if the mother did not return on time with C?  AB points to two particular matters.  First, if X is indeed in India and if he accepts that he is the biological father, both of which are unknown, he could as C&#8217;s father apply for orders in respect of C in the courts of India.  I recognise that that is a risk but at no stage during C&#8217;s life has he ever expressed any interest in C and I have no reason to think that this might now be the case.  True it is that Indian proceedings may take what might seem an extraordinarily long time to resolve, as the single joint expert points out.  But there is, so far as I know, no bar to AB visiting India and exercising all his rights to spend time with C.   He is now a holder of parental responsibility for C. </p>

She says that her parents are the beneficial owners of the property and they have agreed to subrogate their interest in the property to any right or claim that AB might have in the event of a retention of C in India.  With these precautions in place I am as confident as I can be that the mother will return with C on time. </p>

The question, however, has arisen, as to who the sender should be.  I rule that the letter should be sent by the mother&#8217;s solicitors, but in a form agreed between the parties, including the guardian.  The body of the letter must make clear that it is a letter that is sent on behalf of all three parties and which has been approved by the judge.  Any and every reply must be copied to the other parties subject only to the redaction of name and address. </p>

He saw the inconsistency and said that he would abandon his claim against the mother for reimbursement. </p>
