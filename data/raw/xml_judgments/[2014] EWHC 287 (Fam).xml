	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns a young girl, E, who has just turned 10, as she was born on the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2004 and I heard this case on the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2014. E&#8217;s mother is IS, a British citizen, who is an ethnic Russian originally from Kazakhstan. Her father is EG a British national. Her parents met in 2000, their relationship lasted until August 2005 when EG left the family home. E has not seen her father since July 2009 when her mother took her to Russia; ostensibly for a holiday visit she has now told me while giving evidence that she removed E from the jurisdiction having already formed the intention to remain in Russia and to deny E contact with her father. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the case of IS that E has been sexually abused by her father at some time during the period between 2005 and 2008 when she was having contact. These allegations which her mother and maternal grandmother say were disclosed to them by E were investigated by the Metropolitan Police and by Westminster Social Services in early 2009 and both investigations concluded that there was no basis for taking the matter further. E had two ABE interviews, one on the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2009 and one on the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2009. In neither interview did E make any disclosures of sexual abuse. Following the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> interview and an order of the court for a section 7 report (ordered by District Judge Bowman on the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2009) Westminster Social Services filed a letter with the court which said, among other things, that they did not believe that the information provided by E on its own supported an allegation of sexual abuse, the questioning and taping by her mother of E raised questions regarding the reliability of this information, and that IS had stated the intention of obtaining a child psychologist [report] solely to further investigate the allegations which they would not support as they believed further investigation was not necessary. They concluded that they did not believe that EG posed a risk to his daughter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Prior to the allegations of sexual abuse, around the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August 2008, it was alleged that E had complained of her treatment at the hands of her father&#8217;s then girlfriend CC. Specifically E complained that CC shouted at her and that she had hurt E when she had washed her. E complained of soreness in her genital area. This was investigated by Westminster and in their Core Assessment report they concluded that there were no concerns as to physical/sexual abuse by CC but that it was likely that E became sore around her bottom when being washed by CC.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following E&#8217;s retention in Russia, on the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2009, EG issued an Originating Summons in wardship and orders were made to locate E. Meanwhile IS claimed refugee status in Russia and E started school there. Nearly two years later, in June 2011, having found out that E and her mother were in Moscow, her father issued an application for contact: at the same time IS sought to have him deprived of his parental rights. There followed proceedings in the Butyrsky District Court in Moscow granting EG monthly contact. IS appealed against that order and her appeal was dismissed.</p>

	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the currency of the Russian proceedings IS claimed that E had made further disclosures to her about sexual abuse by neighbours of her father&#8217;s which took place in a garage and in his flat. IS took E to be interviewed by an educational psychologist, Ana Anatolyevna, and she produced a transcript of this interview which was put before the court in Moscow. This report and that of the centre in which Ms Anatolyevna was based was the subject of criticism by the District Court both as to methodology and as to the competence and qualification of the authors of the report to reach the conclusions they did; a finding that was not over-turned on appeal. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Contact was ordered in Russia. IS was subsequently found not to have complied with the order and to have evaded the court bailiffs. She removed E from school and did not take her to the Uchastie Centre where contact was ordered to take place.  The contact order was varied on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2013. IS removed E from school and home-tutored her. Eventually on the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December IS returned to England with E.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Notwithstanding that none of the evidence filed in the previous proceedings (set out below) had been found by those investigating the allegations to support a basis of sexual abuse, IS seeks findings in this court. She also seeks a finding that CC physically abused E. EG seeks a finding that IS fabricated the allegations to undermine contact and has caused E &#8220;serious emotional harm.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are civil proceedings, the burden of proof is on the party making the allegations. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities &#8211; &#8220;neither more nor less&#8221; &#8211; to quote Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (Care proceedings:  Standard of Proof)</span> [2008] UKHL&#160;35, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 2 FLR 141" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 2 FLR 141</ref>. I&#160;may make a judicial inference upon facts that are themselves established and the balance of probability, and here I&#160;make reference to <span style="font-style:italic">A local authority v A (No.1)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/28" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 28 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 28 (Fam)</ref> also reported [2011] 2&#160;FLR at 137, and I&#160;will do so in the course of this judgment. Once a decision is reached on the facts it will form the basis of any decision as to what orders should be made in respect of E. All decisions regarding E will be based on the paramouncy principle; that is to say her welfare is paramount. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The allegations made by IS are of a very serious nature but that does not alter the standard of proof. As Baroness Hale said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B</span> there is no logical connection between seriousness and probability. I keep that in mind as I do the need to consider all the evidence with care taking into account the totality of the evidence before the court including the background to the allegations, their genesis and the conduct of the parties. I shall set out some of the evidence in the narrative in this judgement, which should be read as a whole, forming as it does the path I followed through the history of the case to reach my conclusions.</p>

I have read the statements of the parties contained in the wardship bundle and in the bundle prepared for the hearing on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2009. I have read the documents, reports, letters and transcripts contained in both bundles, and the translations of the decisions of the Russian courts which were reached when IS retained E in Russia between July 2009 and December 2013. I have read the reports prepared for those hearings and a transcript of  interviews E had with a educational psychologist on the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July and 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of August 2011.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the end of June 2011 EG started proceedings in the Russian courts, applying for a contact order and IS counter-claimed to deprive him of his parental rights. The court ordered that E should be interviewed by a psychologist at the Uchastie Centre for Diagnosis and Counselling. In July and August 2011 E was interviewed at the OZON centre. This was not ordered by the court in Russia; it is a matter of dispute how the referral came to be made as IS says it was made by her local authority and EG says it was made by the mother. The document from the OZON centre dated 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2011 sets out at the outset of the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> paragraph that IS contacted the Centre in respect of her daughter E. The interview with E is appended to that document. The local authority decision of the Council of Inter-city Municipal Establishment &#8220;Presnenskoye&#8221; in the City of Moscow is translated as stating in paragraph 6 that the Butyrsky District Court contacted the authority responsible for guardianship of minors and that E was then referred to OZON. It is not possible to say exactly how the referral came about, it was undoubtedly supported by IS. The Russian court rejected its findings and was highly critical of it. I do not intend to go behind their decision and find myself in agreement with many of their criticisms; their report as translated and exhibited is absent of any explanation for the methodology involved and lacks any analysis of the interview or interviews undertaken with E. </p>

There are serious shortfalls in the report which accepts all that is said by the child and her mother (and there is no record of what was said by IS) at face value without analysis or challenge which undermines the conclusions reached. Over and above those shortcomings is the fact that the OZON Centre did not engage with or interview EG which can only have increased the lack of balance and analysis in their report.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The interview of E must be set against the antipathy of her mother towards her father and her marked reluctance to promote contact ever since she and EG parted. A reluctance which is clear from the history of contact going back to before E&#8217;s second birthday. The interview with Ms Solovyeva took place after E had been separated from her father, geographically and physically having had no contact for two years. She had become immersed in a very different culture and language and had spent most of the time with her mother. The allegations disclosed by IS to the police in her emails were not repeated in any detail by E. E did not, for example, say she had been blindfolded or tied up when pictures were taken of her; she did not say there were objects used on her, or that she was hurt so much they had to stop. E did not say other children were hurt in her presence or that red paint that looked like blood was used to frighten her. All these are allegations made by IS alone. This pattern repeats that when E was interviewed twice by the police in London in the presence of the social worker; the disclosure of sexual abuse of a much more serious nature which she is alleged to have made to her mother, and grandmother, are not repeated by E herself when she is interviewed.</p>

She told me she had not intended to return to England but was being pursued by the court bailiff and had no choice. She told me she had no intention of obeying the Russian court&#8217;s orders. It is not clear what her immigration status was when she left Russia but the ground for her refugee status must have been substantially undermined by the courts decisions in respect of E and her father. IS told me that when she had written to this court refusing to allow a safe and well check by British Embassy staff she had done so as to co-operate with the check would have undermined her claim for refugee status. </p>

It is plain that in order to do so she needed the agreement of EG. IS accepted that contact went well between March and July 2009 and that relations improved between herself and EG.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">LN&#8217;s evidence was unconvincing. She seemed to be going through the motions and displayed little emotion apart from a ill concealed dislike for EG. She complained about his lack of financial support; which was not based on the reality of the situation, as apparently there was a substantial financial settlement. LN could not find one positive thing to say about him yet she did not appear convinced about the allegations. The clock game as demonstrated by her consisted of the child moving both hands against each other in a circular motion as if the hands of a clock. E was not distressed at the time she told her, or at any time she told her grandmother about games with her father. E put her hands on her grandmother&#8217;s chest, stomach and abdomen. It would appear that E was doing nothing more than playing in bed first thing in the morning and LN chose to find it wrong and disgusting because it fitted with her dislike of EG. She said that her daughter did not tell her she would remain in Russia. I find this most unlikely and even if she did not LN clearly had no objection to the plan or to denying E contact with her father. LN was not a witness who inspired belief in her evidence or displayed insight into her granddaughter&#8217;s current situation. </p>

He accepted that he was very quick to introduce other women to E. He said that he and E would mess about in bed in the morning when she had contact but he had no knowledge of the clock game. However I thought he lacked sensitivity and empathy for E and was dismissive in respect of her feelings in respect of CC, in particular.</p>

The evidence contained in the investigations at the time show that E complained about her and about being bathed by her in a way that E found uncomfortable and that the complaints were consistent and made to different people, spontaneously in different circumstances. E made it plain she did not like CC and did not enjoy her being there. EG denies that CC bathed E; and says that E seemed to get on well with CC. </p>

To do so without her being given an opportunity of responding or defending herself would be a breach of her rights under the ECHR. The evidence such as it is primarily of E&#8217;s discomfort and dislike of being with CC; there could be many reasons for this (as was observed in the core assessment) including picking up on her mother&#8217;s antipathy and probably that of her maternal grandmother too. I find that EG was slow to consider how his very young daughter would feel about the introduction of CC and too quick to dismiss E&#8217;s unhappiness. He displayed a lack of sensitivity which he can ill afford to replicate now if he is to build a relationship with his daughter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not find any of the allegations of sexual abuse are proved on the balance of probabilities. The attempts to influence the ABE interview with the police by taping the allegations and transcribing them &#8220;to make sure they got it right&#8221;  as IS said in evidence. The lack of any convincing detail as to how the allegations came to light either in London in 2009 or in the Black Sea resort, instead relying on generalised observations of sexual abuse victims which IS said she&#8217;d researched. Her delay in reporting allegations to the local authority do not ring true and are not indicative of a parent who believes that their child has been abused. When put together with the obstruction of contact that was there from the outset from shortly after the parties separated and the absence of allegations of sexual abuse by E being made to independent witnesses, until after the sojourn in Russia, the balance weighs against making findings that sexual abuse took place.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The most telling piece of evidence against there being any basis for the allegations being true is the evidence and conduct of IS herself. I find it striking that she told me that she had decided to go to Russia and remain there in defiance of the court orders shortly after they were made in March 2009. To do so she had to get the agreement of EG and avoid a return to court. IS must have deliberately set out to gain his trust by ensuring contact took place without difficulty and that she was on good terms with him. Either she did not believe that sexual abuse had ever taken place, or she cynically and deliberately placed her daughter at risk of further abuse for the 4 months prior to her move to Moscow. On balance I find it more likely than not that she did not believe her daughter to be at risk. I do not think that she would place E in danger, but rather that she knew she was safe because the allegations had no foundation and were not true.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Such calculated behaviour can only be as a result of deliberate planning. The plan was to sever the relationship between E and her father. The obstruction of contact, the blatant disobedience in the face of court orders here and in Russia could be seen as an attempt to safeguard a beloved child but any such view here is vitiated by the fact that IS ensured that E stayed with her father regularly between March and July 2009. She did this to manipulate a situation where she could go to Russia with his agreement in order to achieve her aim of stopping contact, not to ensure E&#8217;s safety but to stop her having a relationship with her father.</p>

She has not filed a report but her initial impressions of E are contained in the Position Statement filed on her behalf, dated the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, 2013. She found both meetings concerning as E was nervous, tearful and anxious. E said she did not want to remember about her dad. She believes she has been sexually assaulted by him; and by CC the latter resulting her being taken to hospital. There is no evidence that E was taken to hospital as a direct result of CC hurting her. The Guardian says that findings of the  court will form the basis for a welfare hearing and for work that needs to be done with E for, as she says either E was sexually abused or she believes she was; both constitute significant harm.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Had these allegations been made in public law proceedings the court would not have delayed in hearing the evidence to determine whether there had been abuse or whether the child had been made to believe in such abuse, for as the Guardian observes, both constitute real harm. The need for judicial determination of the facts in private law cases is as necessary as it is in public law cases as the court has a duty to protect children and ensure that decisions and orders are made which are consistent with their best interests and welfare. To do so requires that the factual basis on which orders are made is not permitted to become the subject of a continuous dispute between the parties. It is necessary that there is judicial determination of issues such as there were in this case at the earliest opportunity to avoid proceedings being drawn out and conducted by way of review. An early determination of the facts in this case, in 2009, would have formed the basis for decisions about contact and residence that may well have avoided the enforced separation of E from her father which has allowed her perception of her father to become more and more distorted. </p>
