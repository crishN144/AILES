	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This court is concerned with two appeals, each of which involves allegations of domestic abuse, specifically rape and sexual assault, by one parent against the other. This judgment is in three main parts: the first concerns the general propositions of law engaged by both appeals; the second concerns my determination of the appeal in the case of ABC; and the third, my determination of the appeal in DE. I have given these initials to the parties in these appeals in order to prevent identification of the children with whom these appeals are concerned.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Permission to appeal in the case of ABC was given by Morgan J and in the case of DE by Arbuthnot J. As the grounds on which permission was given raised similar issues, both cases were allocated to me and listed for a case management hearing on 7 October 2022. Prior to that hearing and in an effort to give some focus both to the wide-ranging submissions made by the Appellant mothers and the rather broad grounds on which permission had been given, I prepared a document which set out the general propositions raised in both appeals upon which I would require submissions. Those propositions were as follows:</p>

The Centre for Women&#8217;s Justice produced helpful written argument and a bundle of relevant authorities but, though present in court through leading counsel, did not participate in the oral argument. On 18 November 2022, I heard oral argument specific to each appeal. This judgment is lengthy and would have been even longer had I listed all the evidence and submissions I considered. I have, of course, taken all I have read and heard into account in reaching my decisions.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In a wide-ranging document, the Appellant mothers asked the court to give guidance on matters such as how allegations of sexual assault, rape and consent to sex should be determined in family proceedings. Such a course is problematic given the role of the appellate court which is to determine whether the decision at first instance was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;wrong&#8221;</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity in the proceedings in the lower court&#8221;</span> (see Family Procedure Rules 2010 [&#8220;the FPR&#8221;], rule 30.12(3)]. On behalf of father B, Miss Fottrell KC submitted that, were the court to embark on the exercise suggested by the Appellants, it would go well beyond its appellate role by seeking to legislate on matters where Parliament had declined to do so. If Parliament had intended the framework applicable to these issues in the criminal justice system to apply to the family court, it would have made that clear. It would thus be wrong for the court itself to construct a wholly new legal framework. She drew my attention to the clear guidance of the Court of Appeal on the use and application of criminal legal concepts in the family court reiterated as recently as 2021 in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H-N and Others (Children) (Domestic Abuse: Finding of Fact Hearings</span>) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2021/448" uk:canonical="[2021] EWCA Civ 448" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWCA Civ 448</ref> [&#8220;<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H-N</span>&#8221;] . </p>

(3) Disputed matters of social policy are less suitable areas for judicial intervention than purely legal problems. (4) Fundamental legal doctrine should not be lightly set aside. (5) Judges should not make a change unless they can achieve finality and certainty.&#8221;</span></p>

The President of the Family Division can exercise the statutory function delegated to him by the Lord Chief Justice, of issuing a Practice Direction. The President can issue also non-statutory Practice Guidance. The Family Justice Council can issue guidance, which typically bears the President&#8217;s endorsement (a recent example is Guidance on Financial Needs on Divorce, June 2016). The President can commission a piece of work from some appropriate expert which is then issued with his imprimatur (for example, The Family Courts: Media Access and reporting - Guidance issued by the President of the Family Division, Sir Nicholas Wall, the Judicial College and the Society of Editors, issued in July 2011). Very typically, all these various forms of guidance are the result of processes which, even if they do not involve wider consultation, will have involve the input of the Family Justice Council and/or the Family Procedure Rule Committee.</span></p>

It presented a de novo framework which was impermissible and unnecessary. She submitted that importing definitions applied in the criminal courts or having regard to the ingredients of particular offences ran contrary to the purpose of the fact-finding task in family proceedings. A focus on seeking to characterise or establish behaviour as meeting a particular definition obscured the court&#8217;s task of identifying and determining only those factual disputes which were relevant to the child&#8217;s welfare.</p>

It had the freedom to determine what was abusive within the definitions set out in PD12J, always focused on what was relevant for the welfare determination.

Its focus, as <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re R</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H-N</span> made clear, is to determine how the parents of a child behaved towards each other so as to be able properly to assess risk and determine the welfare issues in each case. I note that Parliament recently passed the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17" uk:canonical="2021 c. 17" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Domestic Abuse Act 2021</ref> and, in so doing, expressly replicated in the family court some provisions applicable in the criminal courts, for example, in relation to cross-examination by litigants in person. However, Parliament declined to legislate for a framework in the family court within which to determine allegations of rape and sexual assault: it was not invited to do so during the passage of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17" uk:canonical="2021 c. 17" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. In those circumstances, it is difficult to conceive that this court might now attempt to do so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At first instance, the family court determines allegations of rape and sexual assault without a legislative definition or framework. That is consistent with the purpose of a fact-finding exercise in family proceedings, which is to determine only such factual issues as are necessary to assess risk and to illuminate the welfare issues. That approach in private law proceedings is consistent with the approach in public law proceedings in which the family court conducts fact-finding in circumstances where, for example, a parent is alleged to have caused the death of a child, or where a parent is alleged to have inflicted injury on a child.</p>

It is unnecessary for me to identify the judgments in issue since the relevance of those decisions was not the characterisation of behaviour by reference to concepts of consent or submission to sexual intercourse but rather that the court had accurately determined narrative findings which could inform the subsequent risk and welfare analysis. In that regard, I am very clear that the comments of the Court of Appeal at [71] in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H-N</span> are crucial in underscoring the clear distinction between the family and the criminal court, namely that:</p>

The judge failed to bring the various points of challenge made by the father into his evaluation. Those failures meant that there cannot be said to have been a fair consideration of these important allegations from the father&#8217;s perspective. At no stage did the judge step back and consider the mother&#8217;s credibility in the round, bringing into account his findings that the mother had put forward false allegations of reporting to Dr C, of financial control, and (also) of isolation from her family when in fact the family had lived with her parents between 2004 and 2012.&#8221;</span></p>

It includes definitions of the sorts of behaviour which constitute domestic abuse and general principles by which the court should be guided but, rightly, does not contain a detailed framework to assist the family court either in evaluating evidence or in determining what might constitute domestic abuse in an individual case. As I have already indicated, the inclusion of the type of framework advocated for by Mr Metzer KC would inappropriately narrow the court&#8217;s focus and run the risk of becoming a tick box exercise rather than a holistic evaluation of the evidence in a particular case.</p>

All the parties appeared to be in agreement that a complainant&#8217;s sexual history with a person not involved in the proceedings would rarely be relevant. However, Mr Metzer KC alone sought to persuade me that evidence of consensual sexual encounters between the complainant and the alleged perpetrator was irrelevant when the court was determining allegations of abusive sexual behaviour.</p>

First, obligations in relation to disclosure and inspection arise only when the relevance test is satisfied. Relevance can include &#8220;train of inquiry&#8221; points which are not merely fishing expeditions. This is a matter of fact, degree and proportionality. Secondly, if the relevance test is satisfied it is for the party or person in possession of the document or who would be adversely affected by its disclosure or inspection to assert exemption from disclosure or inspection. Thirdly, any ensuing dispute falls to be determined. We determined ultimately by a balancing exercise, having regard to the fair trial rights of the party seeking disclosure or inspection and the privacy or confidentiality rights of the other party and any person whose rights may require protection. It will generally involve a consideration of competing ECHR rights. Fourthly, the denial of disclosure or inspection is limited to circumstances where such denial is strictly necessary. Fifthly, in some cases the balance may need to be struck by a limited or restricted order which respects a protected interest by such things as redaction, confidentiality rings, anonymity in the proceedings or such other order. Again, the limitation or restriction must satisfy the test of strict necessity.&#8221;</span></p>

The fact that adult parents had previously or subsequently engaged in consensual sexual activity of any sort does not mean that they were not raped or sexually assaulted on another occasion. However, evidence as to the parents&#8217; sexual relationship may be logically probative of an allegation of partnership rape or sexual assault. Thus, communications between the parties of a sexual nature may well be relevant as may communications between them either before or after the relevant incident or time period. That approach is in keeping with the court&#8217;s obligation to consider the wide canvas of evidence and its duty to have regard to patterns of behaviour - both of the complainant and the alleged perpetrator - as described in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H-N</span>.

I decline to do so. First, that approach runs contrary to current practice in the family court which has been centred on relevance and is free from presumption or starting point. It also runs contrary to the basic principle that, by adopting an inquisitorial approach, the court requires the best <span style="font-weight:bold">relevant </span>evidence before it to assess both the risk posed by a parent or the welfare best interests of the child. Second, and practically speaking, the Appellant&#8217;s approach runs the risk of depriving the court of evidence relevant to its factual determination. I observe that there may well be circumstances in which evidence of sexual history <span style="font-weight:bold">as between partners</span> is relevant to the court&#8217;s assessment of the dynamic, their respective patterns of behaviour and the nature of their relationship.</p>

The CPS Guidance is a dynamic document which is regularly updated in accordance with new case-law.

In that regard, I note that the Court of Appeal highlighted the training available to family judges in [67]-[68] of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H-N</span> as follows:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">Following the judgment of Russell J and at the request of the President, the Judicial College devised a freestanding sexual assault awareness training programme for Family judges. The programme draws heavily on the successful &#8220;serious sexual assault&#8221; programme for criminal judges. Since July 2020, it has been a mandatory requirement for all judges who hear any category of Family cases to undertake this programme. The programme, which is under constant review, includes elements in respect of psychological reactions to sexual assault and trauma, and has the benefit of contributions having been made by a number of victims of sexual assault discussing the impact that an attack has had upon them. In addition to the more general training in relation to domestic abuse, which is already in place for Magistrates, bespoke training suitable for the work they undertake in respect of sexual assault and trauma is in the process of being developed.</span></p>

Though written to assist those sitting in the criminal courts, there is much in that section which family judges may find useful. The Equal Treatment Bench Book is publicly available on the judiciary.uk website at <a class="Hyperlink" href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Equal-Treatment-Bench-Book-July-2022-revision-2.pdf">Equal Treatment Bench Book July 2022 revision (2) (judiciary.uk)</a><span class="Hyperlink">.</span> Likewise, the CPS Guidance on Rape and Sexual Offences at Annex A provides a comprehensive guide to the unhelpful stereotypes which may cloud judicial thinking in cases involving sexual assault.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have also come to the view that I should not produce a list of common rape myths or stereotypes or attempt to craft a standard self-direction about sexual assault stereotypes which a family judge might give her/himself. No list would be comprehensive.  Further, it would run the risk of creating a rigid framework to which adherence would be given. That would deprive a family judge of the flexibility to think about what is apposite in the particular case, having been appropriately trained to recognise unhelpful stereotypes, and should they consider it necessary to do so, for a family judge to draw attention in her/his judgment to the manner in which they have guarded against applying any relevant stereotypes. Secondly, any self-direction I might devise would be equally inflexible because it cannot encompass the great variety of stereotypical thinking outlined, for example, in the two sources to which I have referred. </p>

His expressed findings are always surrounded by a penumbra of imprecision as to emphasis, relative weight, minor qualification&#8230; of which time and language do not permit exact expression, but which may play an important part in the judge&#8217;s overall evaluation&#8217;</span></p>

She said he manipulated her emotionally as well as causing her vaginal trauma.

A second incident of rape was alleged to have taken place in the mother&#8217;s home in January 2014 the presence of her daughter (then aged two years).

Later that month, the mother said she did not wish to make a complaint of rape as she felt it would worsen her situation. However, in April 2015, the mother contacted the police saying she wished to pursue her complaint of rape and gave a video recorded interview. The father was arrested in July 2015 and interviewed but asserted that the sexual encounter in January 2014, which was the subject of the rape complaint, was consensual.

Additionally, the judge noted that the mother had given an inconsistent account of the alleged rapes to a consultant psychologist who reported in 2019. The mother had also neglected to inform the psychologist that she and the father had resumed their sexual relationship in early 2017. Finally, the mother&#8217;s case that she was coerced and manipulated by the father was, in the view of the judge, inconsistent with the text messages and photographs sent by her to the father in 2017. In [60] of her judgment, the judge made plain that she preferred the evidence of the father to that of the mother who, the judge commented, had a tendency to recharacterise past events to make them consistent with her view that the father had abused her.</p>

It is not probable in my judgment that she would have resumed such a highly charged sexual relationship with [B] if he had raped her as [A] suggests.

Significantly, in my judgment, those messages and exchanges are consistent with a consensual relationship, there is no sense of unwillingness that can be derived from them on the part of [A], or any sense that she is in a position where she had to placate an abusive partner. Looking at the broad canvas of matters, therefore, and the fact that [A] did not volunteer anything about the resumption of her relationship with [B] in 2017 until the text messages referred to were put in evidence by [B], I am unable to accept [A&#8217;s] account is accurate. If [A] had truly felt she had no choice but to engage in a relationship with [B] in 2017 she could and should have been upfront about that in the context of her allegations that this was a coercive and abusive relationship. In fact, the suggestion that [A] felt that she had no choice but to engage in a relationship with [B] because she needed support only came after [B] had put the resumption of their relationship in 2017 into evidence. For all the reasons set out above therefore, and on the basis of the evidence I have seen and heard, I prefer the evidence of [B] on this allegation and I do not find [A] has proved this allegation.&#8221;</span></p>

The judge did not ignore the asserted pattern of behaviour to focus only on specific incidents but, under the framework of the individual allegations pleaded, stood back and considered the relationship and the dynamic between the parents as a whole: she took a holistic view, as stated often in her analysis.

I cannot find on the evidence that [A] was being coerced or manipulated into continuing a relationship with [B].

Further, the judge evaluated the mother&#8217;s allegation that she was pressured or coerced into having sex and rough sex at that. The mother had expressly relied upon an assertion that there was medical evidence in support of her sustaining vaginal trauma as a result. Having surveyed the wide canvas of evidence, the judge could not identify any such medical evidence. She also for the reasons articulated in her judgment found the mother&#8217;s evidence about being pressured into conceiving a child and coerced into having an abortion to be internally inconsistent, preferring the evidence of the father on this issue. Thus, the judge evaluated the mother&#8217;s allegations about pressure and coercion in the parental relationship by reference both to the evidence as a whole and to the evidence of each party.</p>

Firstly, and following the parties&#8217; separation in 2014, the mother had taken a number of protective measures and sought support from a variety of sources: obtaining non-molestation relief from the family court; reporting to the police on several occasions the father&#8217;s breaches of that order; reporting to the police and then eventually pursuing allegations of rape and sexual assault; obtaining support from the local authority and from domestic abuse support services; and obtaining support from her GP. Secondly, between November 2014 and December 2016, there was no contact between the parties. Thirdly, in January 2017, the mother initiated contact with the father seeking his support to care for their child. Thereafter, she facilitated contact between the father and his child. Fourthly, the parties resumed a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;sexually charged and explicit relationship&#8221;</span> in which, on the judge&#8217;s assessment, the mother appeared to be very much in control of her role and where she was clear in articulating her own wants and desires. Fifthly, in 2019, the mother obtained support from a psychologist, Dr X, to whom, in the judge&#8217;s assessment, she inaccurately reported the most serious of the allegations she made to the court and she also failed to inform Dr X that she had resumed a sexual relationship with the father in early 2017.</p>

The judge did attach weight to the contemporaneous evidence from early 2017 when evaluating the mother&#8217;s assertion that the sexual relationship between the parents at that time was non-consensual. It is difficult to see how the judge&#8217;s approach can be challenged when she was entitled to do so as part of her evaluation of the evidence.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The key issue was whether the judge placed improper weight on the evidence relating to the parents&#8217; 2017 relationship when assessing the allegations of earlier sexual abuse. The judge clearly took that material into account when assessing the relationship as a whole. However, it was evident that her analysis of the earlier allegations of rape and sexual coercion was based on her assessment of the parties&#8217; evidence as a whole, with appropriate self-direction as to the caution to be applied to the way in which the parties gave their oral evidence as set out in [21] - [22] of her judgment. Thus, the judge found that the mother&#8217;s evidence with respect to the first allegation of rape in August 2013 was internally inconsistent whereas that of the father was consistent. Where there was a conflict of evidence, the judge preferred that of the father. Additionally, there was an absence of evidence to support the mother&#8217;s account that she had been subjected to rough sex as she described. The mother had expressly claimed that there was medical evidence in support of that allegation yet the judge had been unable to find any such evidence in the records upon which reliance was placed. Further, although the mother had alleged that the father had threatened her and engaged in blackmail, the judge was unable to find evidence of this and preferred the evidence of the father. With respect to the remainder of the allegations, and in particular to allegations that the father had coerced the mother into conceiving a child and into having an abortion, the judge&#8217;s evaluation of each parent&#8217;s evidence led her to find the father&#8217;s evidence on these issues more credible than the mother&#8217;s because of the inconsistencies in the mother&#8217;s evidence.</p>

The judge heard the oral evidence of the mother, the father and five other witnesses and received oral argument from counsel on behalf of the mother and the father. By his judgment - though regrettably not reduced to a schedule contained in the court&#8217;s order dated 20 July 2022 &#8211; the judge found (a) that the mother had been economically controlled by the father; (b) that the father&#8217;s behaviour had, on occasion, been unacceptably nasty and arrogant towards the mother and the child; and (c) that the father had asserted himself over the mother in a way which was insensitive. The judge made no findings on the mother&#8217;s allegation that she had been raped by the father on a date between October 2011 and June 2012 and that, on occasion, the father had strangled her during sex. He also made no findings that the father had physically and psychologically abused the couple&#8217;s child.</p>

The mother&#8217;s case was that she had suffered serious emotional and physical abuse from the father during their relationship whereas the father attributed the breakdown of the marriage to the parties growing apart and to financial pressures as the mother was not working. The couple had one daughter, F, now aged six years, who lived with her mother. Arrangements for the father to spend time with F were agreed through mediation. In 2019, the father entered into a relationship with another woman whom he eventually married. The father claimed that, at this point, contact with F deteriorated as the mother gradually restricted his time with her. The mother maintained that F was not always willing to go with the father and she criticised some of his behaviour towards the child. Contact between the father and F ceased in January 2021.</p>

Further, the father was said to have manipulated the mother into meeting his new partner unannounced on three occasions and to have made fun of and been unkind to F, sometimes refusing to communicate with her; c) the father intimidated the mother by lunging at her in the dark to scare her, by punching his chest to show how strong he was, by threatening the mother when she was pregnant and at a time when she was concerned that the baby had stopped moving in the womb, by grabbing her finger and pushing it backwards when F was crying and the mother refused to hand her to the father; d) the father economically abused the mother by not including her as joint owner of the home, by requiring her to use her savings when she was unemployed in order to pay household bills, by stopping maintenance in retaliation when there were problems with contact; e) the father psychologically abused F by telling her the mother would die and that she would then live with him and by telling her that Covid would kill <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;useless old people&#8221;</span> thereby causing F to become concerned for her grandparents; and f) the father was physically abusive to F by hitting her with an umbrella, by smacking her hard, by biting her finger in January 2021, and by putting his foot on her stomach in December 2018.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the allegation of rape, the judge listed ten deficits in the mother&#8217;s evidence. First, he noted that the mother was unable to give a date as to when the rape occurred, giving three different timeframes between 2011 and 2012. He contrasted this with her ability to give a detailed account of what had occurred when she was raped and said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I found it difficult to accept that an intelligent lady could not place the alleged rape within a very short time window given that the incident was certainly etched in her memory&#8221;.</span> Second, the judge noted discrepancies between the mother&#8217;s account to the police of what had happened when she was raped and her evidence to the court. This included the father putting on a condom, a feature she had not mentioned to the police. Third, the judge noted that there was no contemporaneous evidence to support the mother&#8217;s allegation of rape in that she had not complained to the police, to her GP or to the hospital when she was pregnant. The judge made particular reference to the mother contacting a charity in 2012 for those who had experienced abuse in childhood and said, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;if they had been told about rape in the mother&#8217;s marriage, I am sure they would have told her to go straight to the police and to leave the father&#8221;</span>. The judge noted that the absence of contemporaneous evidence meant that the court only had the evidence of the mother and father about an alleged rape which had happened a decade earlier. Fourth, the mother said that, at the time of the rape, she was unable to move and was in a debilitated state as she was suffering from Lyme Disease. The judge examined the GP notes and concluded that they did not support the picture painted by the mother. However, he noted that the father accepted the mother was unwell at times and that, on one occasion, he had had to shower her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fifth, the mother claimed that the father tried to have anal sex with her which she did not allow. The judge noted the father&#8217;s denial and also observed that, if this was a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;kink&#8221;</span> of the father&#8217;s sexual conduct as had been put on behalf of the mother, there was no explanation why such behaviour had not occurred earlier in their sexual relationship. Sixth, the judge referred to a long email sent by the mother to the father in March 2018, the purpose of which was to explain why the mother felt unable to continue with their relationship. Though the email made reference to the parties&#8217; sexual relationship, there was no reference to any rape or strangulation during sex. Seventh, the judge noted that the mother had left the family home in 2018 to live with her own mother but returned a month later because of difficulties in that relationship. The judge opined that it made no sense for the mother to return to the matrimonial home when there were other options to her such as staying with friends or living in a refuge. Eighth, the judge referred to seemingly affectionate messages between the parties in 2012 and at other times. The judge dismissed the suggestion that such messages reflected the mother&#8217;s fear of the father together with a desire to avoid conflict on the basis that the mother had sent the father a message in May 2018 before she returned to the family home. This described her confronting her own mother about the childhood abuse the mother had experienced and the judge observed that it was odd the mother had chosen to confide in the father about this when she believed him to have abused her. Ninth, the judge noted that nothing had been said about the rape and strangulation during sex in the mother&#8217;s divorce petition. The judge recognised that some petitions were watered down in order to avoid further conflict but considered it strange that these matters had not been mentioned. Tenth and finally, the judge noted that contact had broken down after the father had formed a relationship with a new partner.</p>

He noted that the father had lied to the mother about his sexual experience prior to their relationship. In particular, the judge made reference to the father&#8217;s account to the police of having sex on a daily basis with the mother save for three occasions when she was unwell. The father had accepted that the mother had Lyme Disease which the judge noted must have restricted the mother on occasion. The judge noted that, in his oral evidence, the father tried to distance himself from his account of having sex on a daily basis with the mother. The judge found that the father had been telling the truth in his account to the police. Finally, the judge noted the father&#8217;s lack of sympathy when the mother had spoken to him about the abuse she had suffered as a child.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The judge reached the following conclusions. First, that the father saw sex as important in a relationship and felt entitled to demand it from the mother. He wanted sex regularly and bragged about being sexually experienced so the mother could live up to his sexual expectations. At times and as the mother had suggested, the father wanted sex regularly to make the mother pregnant. However, the father did not know about the mother&#8217;s abusive childhood experiences. Second, the mother had a complex personality and struggled at times with emotions arising from her past and with her desire to become pregnant. Against this background, the judge found that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;she allowed the father&#8217;s demands for sex&#8221;</span>. The judge was not satisfied that the father realised on any occasion that the mother did not want sex or that he knew she did not consent to sex.

The judge had the inestimable benefit of hearing from both the parties at length and was best placed to assess the credibility of their evidence. It was plain that he had reservations about the account given by both the mother and the father which he set out in some detail. He was thus uniquely well placed to determine the factual issues. Likewise, the judge&#8217;s finding that the father had not strangled the mother during sex was grounded in his assessment of the evidence, particularly the deficits he identified in the mother&#8217;s evidence overall.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, Dr Proudman&#8217;s submission, that the judge had failed to stand back and consider the significance of the findings he had made about the parties&#8217; sexual relationship and set these against the other findings he made about the father&#8217;s behaviour, had real traction. First of all, it seems to me that the judge failed to consider whether his findings amounted to behaviour which, though falling short of establishing rape or non-fatal strangulation, was nevertheless profoundly abusive and which should not be ignored (see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H-N</span> at [71]). It might well be thought that, in the circumstances of this case where the judge assessed the father to be a man who wanted things his own way, the father&#8217;s sexual behaviour - evincing an entitlement to daily sex coupled with his admission to having had sex with the mother each day apart from three occasions - might constitute sexually abusive behaviour in circumstances where the mother <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;allowed&#8221;</span> this behaviour to happen. Secondly, that conclusion might also have added force in circumstances where, on my reading of the judgment, the judge had found other examples of abusive conduct by the father within the meaning of PD12J, for example, verbal abuse of the mother, belittling her in front of others, and frightening her as a way of asserting himself over her. In my assessment, though he had a stated awareness of the need to consider if there was a pattern of abusive behaviour, the judge fell into error by failing to stand back and look at the big picture. I venture to suggest that, had the judge adopted the discipline of evaluating his factual conclusions against the definitions in PD12J, so as to produce a schedule of his findings, he may not have fallen into error. A failure to evaluate whether there was a pattern of abusive behaviour has profound implications both for any welfare analysis by Cafcass and for the court&#8217;s ultimate determination about the children&#8217;s welfare.</p>

I have decided that the matter should be remitted to the relevant Designated Family Judge who should determine, by reference to PD12J, whether a further fact-finding hearing is necessary and, if so, its parameters. For the avoidance of doubt, the finding by the judge that the allegations of rape and non-fatal strangulation were not made out stand, as do the positive findings that were made by the judge with respect to allegations two, three and four.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Proudman was highly critical of the judge for adopting what she described as stereotypical thinking about the way a victim of rape should have behaved. Given the conclusion I have come to above, I need not dwell on this issue save to make one observation. I regard the judge&#8217;s comment in [96] of his judgment (see above at [116]) that the mother was intelligent in the context of her failure to seek help about the father&#8217;s sexual behaviour at the time it occurred as unhelpful. The intelligence or otherwise of a victim of sexual assault or of any assault in the context of an intimate relationship is nearly always irrelevant to the reporting of an assault to the authorities. Victims of whatever age, race, sexuality, appearance, intelligence, and background often have the greatest difficulty in reporting when an assault has occurred because of shame, fear of being disbelieved or fear that the process of reporting an assault will itself be traumatic. However, that observation does not mean that the judge&#8217;s finding about rape and non-fatal strangulation should not stand since he gave other detailed reasons grounded in the evidence for coming to his conclusions about those two issues.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I have already commented on the failure by the judge to either produce his own schedule of findings or, if what I was told was correct, to endorse the schedule drafted by counsel. He was not alone in so doing, as the judge in the ABC appeal also failed to produce her own schedule of findings (though one was later produced by counsel at her invitation and attached to her order). Paragraph 29 of PD12J requires a schedule of findings to be attached to the court order following a fact-finding determination. In my view, it is desirable that, with the definitions of domestic abuse contained in PD12J firmly in mind when doing so, a judge produces her/his own schedule of findings, either incorporated into the body of a judgment or appended to its conclusion. That course avoids any lack of clarity about the detail of what the judge found, and any schedule can then be incorporated in or appended to the court&#8217;s order. I make this suggestion fully conscious of the pressures on the family judiciary engaged in what can often be a relentless train of successive fact-finding determinations, but it is not intended to make the task of judgment writing more difficult. On the contrary, I hope it represents good practice which may help to illuminate a judge&#8217;s evaluation of the evidence and to inform their ultimate findings.</p>
