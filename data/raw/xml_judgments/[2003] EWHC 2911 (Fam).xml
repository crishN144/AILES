It sanctioned the mother&#8217;s move to England with Alejandro.

There is in any such application a degree of finality which few other orders achieve within the framework of parental responsibility or family law.  It emphasises the finality of the judgment.</span></p>

This can only sensibly be seen as a continuous process.  Of course an order conferring on one parent custody or residence is more easily classified as a unique determination encapsulated in a single order, but orders for contact or access generally have to be revisited and revised to reflect changes of circumstance.  If the Regulation is to be effective access orders of the court exercising jurisdiction must be enforceable whether the order is embodied in the decree that changes the marital status of the parents or whether in an order pre-dating or post-dating the decree.&#8221;</span></p>
