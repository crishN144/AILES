By the time of the hearing the parties had been living independently for nearly a decade. The former matrimonial home was matrimonial property but W had paid for the vast bulk of outgoings including on food, the wedding and the parties&#8217; child. H&#8217;s contributions had been extremely low. His total contributions were &#163;250 a month from late 2013 to the birth of L and then &#163;500 a month until separation. These contributions were extremely low for a working adult. H had been unable to evidence any other contributions. </p>

When asked whether he was in a relationship with the mother of his son, he answered &#8220;we have a child together. I consider that a relationship.&#8221; He blamed his solicitors for failing to disclose his shareholding portfolio. When asked why he had not provided any text messages or other evidence to substantiate his claim that the parties&#8217; relationship was subsisting between 2015 and 2018, he stated &#8220;I don&#8217;t know the law&#8230;. If there was a requirement for me to provide them, I would have provided them.&#8221; H&#8217;s oral evidence was in keeping with his approach to disclosure, where he had responded to W&#8217;s requests for evidence of his contributions by saying &#8220;check your own bank statements&#8221;.</p>

He blamed his failure to do those courses on the Covid pandemic but gave no indication of any attempts to do them since. When asked why he had not made an enforcement explanation he gave conflicting reasons: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I had to do that. I emailed the judge and the court emailed me with the form.

This appeared implausible. I find it likely that the payments were for a different car.  I take into account that the events in question took place over 10 years ago and I take the view that W was mistaken rather than dishonest in her evidence. The evidence was clear that she had made payments for a car and to that extent it was of little significance. Overall my impression of W was that she was a credible witness. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In applying those factors to the case, the higher courts have indicated that three principles should be applied.&#160; The first is the sharing principle, which means that the assets acquired during the marriage as a result of the matrimonial partnership should be shared out between the parties. Applying that principle may mean identifying which of the assets are matrimonial in nature. This will depend on how and when those assets were acquired, how long they were available to the parties during the marriage and the extent to which they were used to meet the family&#8217;s needs. This is a sliding scale rather than a binary question. The non-matrimonial source of an asset can still be taken into account even where it has been used as a family resource.&#160; The weight attached to the original source depends on the facts of the case.&#160;</p>

H&#8217;s net monthly pay is &#163;3473 compared to W&#8217;s &#163;4059. This difference is likely to be accounted by a combination of H having more deductions and/or doing less overtime and/or not being an instructor. Insofar as it is due to H having more deductions, those are likely to come back to him at some point. Insofar as it is due to him doing less overtime, as a person with no childcare responsibilities there is nothing to stop him doing overtime if he so wishes. Insofar as it is due to him not being an instructor, I am told that he is looking to progress into management and he will therefore have the same increased earning opportunities in due course.
