	      <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">The parties separated in January 2008.&#160; The total length of the marriage was therefore three-and-a-half years.&#160; On 16th May 2008 the husband petitioned for divorce under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.&#160; The wife defended the suit, asserting that she had not behaved in a way that the husband could not reasonably be expected to live with her and that, in any event, the marriage had not irretrievably broken down.&#160; Her answer did not include a cross-petition for divorce.&#160; Prior to the hearing of the defended divorce the husband invited the wife to agree to a sale of the former matrimonial home -- a substantial property in London -- on the basis that a sale was inevitable, given the breakdown of the marriage, the size of the property and the condition of the property market at that time.&#160; The wife refused to agree to the sale.&#160; In view of the fact that she was defending the divorce suit, and that an order for sale in the ancillary relief proceedings under the Matrimonial Causes Act could only be made following a final order, the husband issued an application under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/47" uk:canonical="1996 c. 47" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Trusts of Land and Appointments of Trustees Act 1996</ref> ("TOLATA") seeking an order for sale under that legislation.&#160; The wife opposed the application.&#160; The contested final hearing took place before Mr. Recorder Sapsford QC on 5th June 2009.&#160; By an order dated 31st July 2009, at the end of that hearing, a sale of the property was ordered, with a direction for vacant possession to be given by the wife upon completion.&#160; In October 2009 the divorce suit was heard as a defended cause.&#160; After a hearing lasting five days the court found that the marriage had irretrievably broken down and that the husband could not reasonably be expected to live with the wife.&#160; Thus a decree nisi was granted to the husband on 9th October 2009.&#160; Orders for costs were make against the wife in both the TOLATA proceedings and the defended divorce.</p>

The appeal against the Recorder's decision was dismissed.&#160; Giving the lead judgment in the Court of Appeal, Wilson LJ stated, inter alia, at paragraph 18, that </p>

	    <p class="jus">In this case the Court of Appeal concluded that </p>
	    <p class="ind">"the time frame until possible, indeed perhaps probable, determination of the parties' claim for ancillary relief did not represent a delay tolerable in all the circumstances." (paragraph 19)&#160; </p>
	    <p class="jus">Foremost among the factors that led the Court of Appeal to reach that conclusion were: (a) the fact that the wife had defended the divorce; and (b) the very high mortgage instalments on the matrimonial home. </p>

	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">When one turns to pensions there is a much wider disparity.&#160; The wife has a modest pension fund of about &#163;75,000, whereas the husband, approaching the end of his successful business career, has a fund in excess of &#163;3.7 million under a final salary scheme.&#160; It is the wife's case that she has always been told by the husband that, in the fullness of time she would have the benefit of the widow's pension attached to his company's pension scheme, which will be worth about &#163;120,000 per annum gross.&#160; On that basis she says that she did not keep up her own pension provision.&#160; In addition, she was also told that she should be able to rely upon the husband's private health care insurance and so did not keep up her own.&#160; It is asserted that, other things being equal, if she ceases to be the husband's spouse, she will lose the potential rights to pension provision and health care insurance to which she is currently entitled.&#160; It is said that this would constitute a very significant prejudice to her.&#160; </p>

	    <p class="ind">"Mr. Miller-Smith has contacted the pension trustees in respect of his pension with the company and they have confirmed to him that upon pronouncement of the decree absolute your client will no longer benefit from his pension upon his death.&#160; However, Mr. Miller-Smith is able to nominate your client as a dependent, even if she is no longer married to him and as for as long as she remains so nominated she will benefit from his pension in the event of his death.&#160; Mr. Miller-Smith does not accept that the risk of the loss of pension rights will be a justification for delay of decree absolute in the present case, given the totality of the financial resources available and all the other circumstances of the case, but he is nevertheless prepared to file with the court a formal undertaking to the effect that he will take all necessary steps prior to decree absolute to nominate your client to receive the benefit under his company pension in the event that he should die before an enforceable order resolving your client's claims for financial and ancillary relief has been made in the divorce proceedings between the two of them, unless he has prior to his death been released by the court from his undertaking in respect of this nomination."</p>
	    <p class="NormalWeb">In response to a request for clarification by the wife's solicitors, the husband's solicitors wrote again on 17th November, stating:</p>
	    <p class="ind">"Our client was advised that he can elect for your client as a dependent to receive the benefit from his pension identical to that which she would receive as his widow and he is prepared to do so pending the outcome of the ancillary relief proceedings."</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">Mr. Wilson's position, set out in his written document and developed in clear and careful oral submissions, was as follows.&#160; The wife's primary position was that the matter should be stood out for a further seven days to enable her solicitors to complete their enquiries.&#160; In the event, however, I had an opportunity to hear and consider full argument on the merits of the wife's main application, namely to make an order preventing the husband from seeking a decree absolute pending the resolution of the financial proceedings.&#160; I was able to allow the parties ample time to develop their arguments -- more time than had been indicated in the wife's application as to the probable length of the hearing of her main application.&#160; I am satisfied that all parties were able to deploy all arguments on these matters in the hearing before me.&#160; On that main application Mr. Wilson contended that the court has a discretionary power under its inherent jurisdiction to delay the making of a decree absolute.&#160; He relied on the decisions of the Court of Appeal in <span class="Emphasis">England v England</span> (1980) 10 Family Law 86 and <span class="Emphasis">Dart v Dart</span> (unreported, 27th October 1995).&#160; Mr. Wilson contended that, on the facts of this case, the court should exercise its discretion so as to make such an order.&#160; He submitted that the wife does face very significant prejudice and detriment if a decree nisi is made absolute.&#160; She would, he added, face a very significant loss of pension unless the husband's undertakings are copper-bottomed, which were still being investigated.&#160; He argued that it was vital that this point was clarified properly.&#160; Mr. Wilson accepted that the jurisdiction can only be exercised in special or exceptional circumstances.&#160; He asserted that his client was not seeking to be obstructive.&#160; He accepted that, in the event of the husband's death, the wife would have a claim under the inheritance provisions of the Family and Dependents Act 1975, but that prior to that such a claim would involve very considerable expense and difficulty for her and would be likely to bring her into conflict with her stepchildren which, unhappily, is something that has already occurred during the marriage.</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="text-indent:0.5in">In reply Mr. Turner made three broad points. First, he submitted that there is no power under the inherent jurisdiction to make an order delaying a decree absolute.&#160; Secondly, in the alternative, he argued that if there is such a jurisdiction it should be exercised only sparingly.&#160; Thirdly, he submitted that on the facts of this case an order was unnecessary.&#160; The husband had offered clear undertakings about the pension and health insurance.&#160; Furthermore, any losses that might accrue to the wife in the event of the husband dying, leaving her without a pension or health cover, could be adequately met out of his other substantial assets.</p>

	    <p class="ind">"Consequently, one starts from the proposition that the husband has the right to a decree absolute after the appropriate period from decree nisi, and that period has now elapsed.&#160; In the normal course of events he would be able to make the decree absolute unless the wife is able to show special circumstances to defer it.&#160; At the end of the day it is an exercise of the discretion of the trial judge, but that exercise of discretion weights the granting of the decree absolute against the special circumstances very heavily in favour of the grant.&#160; It is not a balancing exercise in the ordinary sense."</p>
	    <p class="jus">In Dart the Court of Appeal considered, and rejected, several arguments which were said to constitute sufficient reason for delay of the decree absolute.&#160; Amongst those arguments was the possibility that the husband might die before decree absolute and as a result the wife might be worse off.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Butler-Sloss LJ pointed out that</p>

WILSON:</span>&#160; And that is that I am instructed to ask for permission to appeal the order that your Lordship has made, and to seek a stay of the execution of the order pending the hearing of that appeal.&#160; My Lord, there are obviously the issues of law as to jurisdiction, on which your Lordship has found in my favour, but as a matter of the exercise of that discretion, there is an order made which has the effect of changing my client's status by bringing into place a decree absolute at an earlier stage than she has sought and there are the points that I made in my submissions to your Lordship last Wednesday in relation to how that discretion should be exercise.&#160; So in those circumstances I would ask you for permission to appeal.</p>
	    <p class="jus"><span class="Strong">MR. JUSTICE BAKER:</span>&#160; Thank you, Mr. Wilson.&#160; I refuse your application for permission to appeal.&#160; In my judgment this was a very clear decision on the exercise of the discretion and I do not consider that the issues of law which you raise by themselves justify the giving of permission. So I refuse that application.</p>
	    <p class="jus">So far as a stay is concerned, of course, your client is to some extent covered by the terms of the undertaking which give seven days -- give you a leeway of seven days -- after receipt of the notice about the pension benefits.&#160; So in those circumstances I consider -- unless there is anything else you want to say -- that you are adequately covered and that if you wish to pursue this matter further you must make an application in the appropriate terms to the Court of Appeal.</p>
	    <p class="jus"><span class="Strong">MR. WILSON:</span>&#160; So be it, my Lord.</p>
	    <p class="jus"><span class="Strong">MR. JUSTICE BAKER:</span>&#160; Thank you.</p>
	    <p class="jus"><span class="Strong">MR. TURNER:</span>&#160; I am most grateful, my Lord.</p>
	    <p class="jus"><span class="Strong">MR. JUSTICE BAKER:</span>&#160; Application for permission and stay refused.&#160; Mr. Wilson, I would be very grateful if you could draw that order up. It is not something that needs to be done in the next few minutes if you have other matters to attend to; but at some point in the first part of this week, I would be very grateful.</p>
	    <p class="jus"><span class="Strong">MR. WILSON:</span>&#160; My Lord, yes.&#160; I would want to consult with my learned friend over the precise terms of the undertaking --</p>
	    <p class="jus"><span class="Strong">MR. JUSTICE BAKER:</span>&#160; Absolutely.</p>
	    <p class="jus"><span class="Strong">MR. WILSON:</span>&#160; -- before I set it down on paper.</p>
	    <p class="jus"><span class="Strong">MR. JUSTICE BAKER</span>:&#160; The position is you may have observed that I was reading out a judgment.&#160; It is not in a form which I can hand down at the moment.&#160; But in the event that for any reason a transcript is required, there will be no difficulty about that being done at relatively short notice.</p>
	    <p class="jus"><span class="Strong">MR. WILSON:</span>&#160; Thank you very much, my Lord. </p>
	    <p class="jus"><span class="Strong">MR. JUSTICE BAKER:</span>&#160; I think I should retain these papers for the moment in the event that I have to tidy up the transcript for any reason.&#160; Thank you.</p>
