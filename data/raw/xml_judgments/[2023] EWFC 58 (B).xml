Mr M already had a positive assessment to care for M.  Mr M was swiftly and positively assessed to care for N on an interim basis under Regulation 24.  He then put himself forward to be assessed for N as a special guardian.  At this stage the Local Authority's contingency plan for N, if Mr M did not receive a positive assessment, was one of adoption.</p>

The court has therefore been able to conclude matters on the basis of confirming the placement of N in the care of Mr M, together with her half-brother M, with N's placement being secured under a special guardianship order, and M's under a live-with child arrangements order.  There were issues in relation to contact, which I have determined, and the change of surname application in relation to N, which was not contested.</p>

I had at that hearing made the declaration of non-parentage in respect of Mr K not being the father of N.  It seemed to me at that interim hearing that the decision as to whether to adjourn the parental responsibility discharge application was dependent upon whether I considered the discharge of parental responsibility to be a welfare decision or whether I considered it to be an automatic consequence of a declaration of non-parentage.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[9] Ordinarily, an application for an adjournment will be considered before the substantive issues.  In this instance N's application for an adjournment is intrinsically connected to the legal issues that include the need for a welfare analysis before his parental responsibility is discharged.  Therefore, I will consider his application in the overall analysis of the law.  I have quoted extensively from the statutory provisions as there are several relevant threads joining these different statutes.  The Act is the primary source for matters concerning parental responsibility.  S.2 of the said Act addresses who may acquire parental responsibility for a child and what this entails for the holder of it.  Importantly, in this section there is a clear and important distinction in the terms used to describe who may hold parental responsibility.  S.2(1) and (2) refer to 'father and mother'.  However, the provisions of s.2(1A) and (2A) refer to a 'parent' which reflects the terminology of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (2008) ('HFEA 08').  Part 2 of the HFEA 08 sets out the definitions and who shall be treated as the mother, father and a parent.  Further detailed consideration of these provisions fall outside of the scope of the submissions that I have received and this judgment.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[10] S.4 of the Act addresses the 'Acquisition of parental responsibility by father'.  Where the father is not married to the mother or in a civil partnership, he may acquire parental responsibility by three routes, registration as the father, parental responsibility agreement or an order of the court.  S.4(2A) provides that where a father has acquired parental responsibility under the provisions of s. 4(1) of the Act, he may only cease to have it by an order of the court.  The registration of an individual as the father is governed by the provisions of the Births and Deaths Registration Act (1953) ('the BDRA 53').  S.10 of this Act sets out the different routes though which an unmarried father may be formally registered as the child's father.  The terminology used in this provision is clear when referring to the father and the mother.  S.10ZA of the Act refers to 'father' and 'second female parent', when setting out the registration requirements relating to the HFEA 08.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[11] The submissions by the mother, the local authority and the guardian are founded on the clear references to the term 'father' in the above mentioned enactments.  It is argued that the legal framework around the acquisition of parental responsibility by an unmarried father is based on a rebuttable presumption that the 'father' is the biological father of the child.  If that presumption is rebutted, the very foundation for the acquisition of parental responsibility is displaced.  This in turn gives rise to consideration as to whether the parental responsibly will be void ad initio or whether it ceases on declaration of 'non-parentage' or reregistration.  It is submitted that it would be contrary to the intention of parliament and more generally, public policy that the parental responsibility should be void <span style="font-style:italic">ab initio</span>.  Mr Kirkwood, having taken the lead on this issue, argues that in circumstances such as this case, where a person such as N, has exercised his parental responsibility in good faith, there may be enumerate possible difficulties if the legality of his decisions and actions are threatened.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[12] N agrees with the analysis of the other parties in respect of the presumption that informs the acquisition of parental responsibility by an unmarried father.  However, Mr Merrigan argues that there is no 'automatic discharge' of the parental responsibility.  The Act is explicit by providing [S.4(2A)] that N will only cease to hold parental responsibility if the court orders it so.  Thus, the court is tasked with a welfare analysis when faced with what is effectively an application for the discharge of N's parental responsibility.  Furthermore, such an analysis is better undertaken at the final hearing where the court will be tasked with analysing the overall welfare of each of the children.  So it is that he invites the court to adjourn this application to the Issues Resolutions Hearing which is listed some weeks away.  He relies on the analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">A local Authority v SB &amp; Ors</span> as detailed earlier in this judgment.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[13] The relevant term of the statutory provisions clearly refer to a 'father' and when there is a requirement to state otherwise, for example reference to a 'parent', the said provisions meet that requirement.  This clearly illustrates the clear intention behind the statutory scheme that has catered for the means by which different individuals with different relationships to the child can acquire parental responsibility which is commensurate with the values of the progressive and modern society we live in.  As observed by Theis J, the Act itself does not define the term 'father'.  In my judgment, the biological link is the foundation that identifies a man as the father of the child under the aforementioned statutory regime.  When that foundation is displaced, the status of that man as the 'father' cannot persist.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[14] There is a greater divergence in the parties' positions as to the impact of a declaration of 'non-parentage' that recognises and gives effect to the rebutted presumption of a biological link between N and C. S.4(2A) is clear in its terms that provide where a father who has acquired parental responsibility via the three routes that are identified in s.4(1), may only cease to have it if the court orders it.  In this section there is no requirement for a welfare analysis for a father to acquire parental responsibility through registration.  The Act provides for additional routes through which individuals, whether the father or not, with or without a parental biological link, may acquire parental responsibility (see s.8 of the Act).  There is no doubt that such an application will be determined by the court by considering the child's welfare as paramount and undertaking an analysis of the child's welfare.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[15] However, in my judgment this does not support an argument that an order under s.4(2A) enquires [sic, 'requires' clearly intended] a welfare analysis.  It lends support to the argument that it does not.  The statutory regime is distinct in its approach to the different routes by which parental responsibly is acquired.  Where the very legal presumption for the acquisition of parental responsibility by operation of law under s.4(1) does not exist, any welfare analysis is superfluous and would serve no purpose at all.  I agree with Mr Kirkwood's sagacious submissions that it would be contrary to public policy and the intentions of parliament to conclude that in such circumstances parental responsibly ceases <span style="font-style:italic">ab initio</span>.  Therefore, this raises the argument that a declaration of 'non-parentage' and a subsequent re-registration is all that is required for N to cease to have parental responsibly for C.  There is an inherent attraction and neatness to this argument.  However, in my judgment, this cannot survive the provision of s.4(2A) of the Act.  Its terms are clear by stating that a court order is required.  In my judgment it would also be good practice to be clear that parental responsibility has ceased by reference to a particular date especially given the public policy arguments that I have summarised above.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[16] Finally, I turn to the issue of the proposed adjournment.  As I have set out earlier in this judgment, the argument for an adjournment is routed in the requirement of a welfare analysis.  Such an argument cannot persist in the face of my judgment that in these circumstances there is no room for a welfare analysis.  Although C may well be aware of N's position, it is important that these proceedings and the space that the parties occupy within it continue in the correct legal premise.  N was made a party to these proceedings and there is no suggestion that his party status should change.  It would be important that he should continue to have the benefit of legal advice and representation within these proceedings.  However, it would be entirely inappropriate for me to involve myself in the assessments that the Legal Aid Agency must undertake in accordance with its own regulations.</p>

If that presumption is rebutted, the foundation for the acquired parental responsibility is displaced.  Subsequently parental possibility will be lost by the order of the court that reflects the status of the individual adult and does not require a welfare analysis.  By contrast, where there is an application for a parental responsibility order or other orders that would grant parental responsibility to the applicant, the court will be tasked with undertaking a welfare analysis.  This is a separate and different route through which parental responsibility may be awarded to the instance case.  Therefore, I grant the mother's application, order that N shall cease to have parental responsibility for C from the date that this judgment is handed down and invite the Registrar to reflect this on the register."</p>

There is no definition of "father" in the CA 1989.  Mr Kingerley and Ms Carew jointly submit that the father must in fact and in law be the father to be able to take advantage of this route to obtaining parental responsibility.  In this case, it is established pursuant to the relevant provisions of the HFEA 2008, outlined above, that PA is not the legal father therefore the inclusion of his name on the birth certificate as the father cannot be correct in the light of the court's declaration.  It follows, therefore, if he is not the father he does not have parental responsibility because section 4 CA 1989 does not apply (to an individual who is not the father).  Although not directly relevant to the application this court is being asked to determine, those submissions make logical sense and I accept their analysis.'</p>

Without hearing full argument, he appears to have proceeded on the basis that the declaration of non-parentage and subsequent removal of a wrongly registered mother from the birth certificate would have the effect of removing her parental responsibility.  It appears to be for that reason that Williams J decided to pause before making the declaration under section 55A of the Family Law Act 1986.

The concept of rival presumptions is not helpful, although I entirely accept that the fact of parenthood raises the welfare question, hence the right of a parent (with or without parental responsibility) to make an application under section 8 CA 1989 without permission (see section 10(4)(a) CA 1989.  There is also ample case law describing the imperative in favour of a continuing relationship between both parents and a child so that ordinarily a child's upbringing should be provided by both of his parents and where that is not in the child's interests by one of them with the child having the benefit of a meaningful relationship with both.

When that foundation is displaced, the status of that man as the father cannot persist", and later, "Registration and the consequential award of parental responsibility by operation of law is based on the rebuttable presumption that he is the biological father of the said child.

It is likely to include men who had little or no relationship with the children in question.  However, it  may very well also include men who could be termed "psychological fathers" to the children concerned, who may have been living with or having very extensive contact with them throughout their childhoods.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The approach of HHJ Moradifar would mean that the court would be compelled to discharge parental responsibility under section 4(2A) whenever a declaration of non-paternity were made.  Of course, in some circumstances the court might nevertheless be able to reinstate parental responsibility if a section 8 order was made.  However, a section 8 order may not always be in the child's best interests.  Indeed, there may be cases where the above approach is simply not open to the court, for example, in respect of a child who is 16 or over, where the making of section 8 orders is heavily restricted.  By contrast parental responsibility lasts until 18.</p>
