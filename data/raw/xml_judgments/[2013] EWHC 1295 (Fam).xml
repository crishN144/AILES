His mother applies for permission to relocate with him to her native country, Columbia.  His biological father is a stranger to him and, subject to what appears below, plays no part in the matter.  His psychological father is his mother's estranged husband, Mr C, who is registered as his father on his Colombian birth certificate and consequently holds parental responsibility for him in that jurisdiction.  Mr C, to whom I will refer as &#8216;the father&#8217; in this judgment, opposes the mother's application to relocate and seeks a residence order or a shared residence order in his favour.  S is represented by a Children's Guardian, who supports the mother's application.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The case has certain unusual features.  In the first place, the proceedings have been on foot since March 2012.  A fact-finding hearing was directed but was repeatedly adjourned.  Schedules of allegations and counter-allegations were created.  In the end, while there are certain credibility issues to be determined, it is accepted by the parties that the outcome does not depend on a fact-finding exercise but upon a broader assessment of S's best interests.  </span></p>

In this case, there may have been some value in a swift early resolution of some of the factual issues, but with the passage of time the direction for a fact-finding hearing has simply kept a number of old and not particularly significant grievances warm long after they should have been allowed to fade in the memory.</span></p>

In the course of these proceedings, a direction was given for Mr P to be contacted.  He apparently received a letter from the Guardian earlier this year, but did not reply.  An e-mail was then sent to him shortly before this hearing.  Mr P replied, asking to be part of the legal process and asserting his parental rights and responsibilities. </span></p>

I did not think it appropriate to delay the progress of the case, bearing in mind that Mr P has never had anything to do with S at any stage in his life and that he had had an earlier opportunity to take part in the proceedings.  It is nevertheless a feature of the case that a return to Colombia would place S at closer quarters to his biological father.  If S lived in Colombia, he would be likely to meet him at some point.</span></p>

In July 2008, when on any view he knew the truth, the mother came to England to be with him.  S remained in Monteria in the care of the mother's sister Paola.  The mother then went back to Colombia between January and July 2009, when she returned to England again.  In December 2009, following the father's divorce, the parents married in England.

In January 2011, they returned to England, bringing S with them.  He was then 3&#189; years old.  The family obtained a one-bedroom flat and S in due course began at a local school.  The mother obtained some cleaning and childminding work and the father continued with his employment.  The mother currently has Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the United Kingdom.

The relationship between the mother and the paternal grandmother was friendly, but the grandparents were never able to visit S.  Contact was limited to a handful of short visits to the grandparents&#8217; own home, including a visit after Christmas 2011.  On that occasion, the grandmother saw the mother slapping S three times on the leg when he was being disobedient.  The grandmother asked her not to do it.  The mother denies the incident took place.</span></p>

The mother found it impossible to be in the small flat with the father, and the father, no doubt alarmed by the failure of the relationship, began to plan defensively for the future.  At the end of that month, he issued proceedings for a residence order and an order preventing S's removal from the home.  A series of hearings followed.  In June 2012, the parties agreed that fact-finding was not necessary, the court declared the father to have parental responsibility (see below), and a shared residence order was made on the basis of an equal division of S's time.  The mother agreed to leave the flat and in early July, she and S entered a refuge.</span></p>

At the time of separation, there is no doubt that the mother was in need of advice and moral support, having left a relationship that she experienced as controlling.  However, it has not been entirely in S's interests, because the rules of the refuge inevitably placed restrictions on the level of contact.  This is not a case in which a parent was fleeing a serious physical threat, yet the most that the Guardian was able to negotiate by way of contact for S was three hours a week, with collection and return at a contact centre.  Moreover, the refuge is about two hours&#8217; journey from S's school, which has been burdensome both for him and for the mother.  </span></p>

The Guardian expresses some confidence that the mother will honour the contact arrangements but makes her recommendation about relocation in the knowledge that enforcement of future contact if S moves to Colombia cannot be guaranteed.</span></p>

While she is by no means without fault, she struck me as having a more balanced understanding of S and a more charitable attitude to the father that he has of her.  I am afraid that the father's anxieties have often got the better of him so that he has become blaming and pedantic, losing sight of the qualities that he once liked in the mother as a parent and a person.

The father's attitude to the mother would be likely to lead him to try to take overall control when he had S and to police the mother when he did not.  The mother should have the ability to bring S up without being the object of continuous suspicion.  This is not a case for a shared residence order, if ever it was.  </span></p>

It may be that material conditions will not replicate what is available in England, but they were good enough for him for the first years of life and I had no reason to believe that this will change.  The father has, over the past six months, worked tirelessly to identify dangers and difficulties relating to the mother's family and their locality.  Even taking these at their highest, they do not persuade me that Cantaclaro is an unsafe or unsuitable place for S to return to.  The father made no such complaint in the good times and I do not accept his account that he has only just found out about it all.  He speaks Spanish and has visited Colombia often, and it is not credible that he would have failed to identify real danger and inadequacy if it truly existed.  Moreover, S is a Colombian child and it is not appropriate to view his welfare through an exclusively English lens.</span></p>

She has not turned S against the father in the course of the past year and has complied with contact orders.  I believe that if the father is willing to meet her halfway in re-establishing some mutual respect, there is every reason to believe that contact will take place in Colombia and England.  The practical and financial difficulties cannot be denied, but they can be overcome with a measure of cooperation.
