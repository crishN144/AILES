D had made an escape. In doing so she put herself at considerable peril.  D managed somehow to scale a six-foot-high wall and run through a barbed wire fence into a very busy main road.  She was found by the police, in a distressed and agitated condition and returned. The following day D&#8217;s behaviour had reached such an alarming level that the staff at Eden House felt the need to call an ambulance because they were afraid that D would seriously injure herself.  They were also extremely concerned about D&#8217;s general well-being. The ambulance took D to Macclesfield Hospital in Cheshire where D was admitted.</span></p>

Thus, it seems reasonable to assume, for the present, that much of her extreme behaviour may be a consequence of what she witnessed in Iraq. This I understand to be the general, tentative, consensus of those who are seeking to help her.</span></p>

The following day D was reported missing to police by her father. The father asked that when D was recovered she be taken to Alder Hey Children&#8217;s Hospital as he believed he simply could not keep D safe.  It was, sadly, felt necessary in the end to convey D to Alder Hey Children&#8217;s Hospital in handcuffs.  When D arrived, she was screaming and assaulting staff, she was attempting to self-harm by putting ligatures around her neck and a plastic bag over her head.  It was decided that there should be both staff and security guards on the door to protect the other children as well as to prevent D harming herself.  </span></p>

The Placements Team contacted commissioners in other Local Authorities, requesting any intelligence concerning potentially suitable placements.

It is not possible in this ex tempore judgment to set out the full chronology of these past few months. Mr Mylonas QC, who appears on behalf of the Trust, has drawn to my attention a particularly alarming fact. The Alder Hey Hospital, specialising as it does in the treatment of profoundly sick children, regularly has four to five air ambulances arriving every day.  He told me that he had been informed by his clients that the noise of those air ambulances caused real distress to D and that it was the view of those treating her that it triggered memories of her experiences in Iraq. She displayed conspicuous behavioural problems at such times. At no point had Judge De Haas been informed of this.  </span></p>

We are, even in these times of austerity, one of the richest countries in the world. Our children and young people are our future. X is part of our future. It is a disgrace to any country with pretensions to civilisation, compassion and, dare one say it, basic human decency, that a judge in 2017 should be faced with the problems thrown up by this case and should have to express himself in such terms.&#8221;</span></p>
