	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in">&#8220;There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely.&#8221;</p>

The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities.  However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence.  Indeed in family cases, where the question is not only &#8216;what happened in the past?&#8217; but also &#8216;what may happen in the future?&#8217;, a witness&#8217;s demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable. </p>

Such interviews should be conducted in accordance with the detailed guidance in Achieving Best Evidence in Criminal Proceedings (ABE) (latest edition 2022) although this guidance is non-statutory. The court can make findings based on ABE evidence so long as it is alive to the hearsay nature of the evidence and the age of the children at the time of interview (<span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Sexual Abuse: Evidence)</span> [2010] EWCA Civ 1030). In <span style="font-style:italic">TW v A City Council</span> [2011] 1 FLR 1597, CA, the Court of Appeal found that the inadequacies of the ABE interview were so manifest, even allowing for a broad margin of latitude to anyone conducting such an interview, that no evidential weight could be placed on it. In particular, it was not sufficient for a judge to rely primarily on the fact that a child might be able to stand up to and overcome a thoroughly unsatisfactory interview; rather, a clear analysis of all the evidence was required and the child&#8217;s interview had to be assessed in that context. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re W; Re F (Children)</span> [2015] EWCA Civ 1300, the forensic value of the ABE interviews was found to be minimal such that the trial judge had been wrong to attach any weight to them. Whether the flaws in ABE evidence are so fundamental as to render the interviews wholly unreliable is a matter for the trial judge who must analyse the process thoroughly to evaluate whether any of the allegations made in such inter views can be relied upon (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re E (A Child) (Evidence)</span> [2017] 1 FLR 1675, CA, <span style="font-style:italic">Re M-Y (Children)</span> [2019] 1 FLR 79, CA and <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (A Child) (Fact-Finding)</span> [2022] EWCA Civ 584 where the Court of Appeal dismissed a father&#8217;s appeal against findings in care proceedings where criticisms were made of ABE interviews).</p>

I find that MGM did say those things; it is difficult to see how the police, the SG assessor and social worker are all wrong in their reports. In relation to the first, it was in the context of an unexpected section 47 enquiry/pre-interview assessment visit to C. In relation to the second she was being asked questions by the SG assessor. In the third this was perhaps unwise but I do not find individually or collectively the allegations come anywhere near meeting threshold which requires significant harm.</p>

However, it is difficult to know how her placement will be effected by such a drastic reduction.  Under their Looked After Procedures, the Local Authority should consider whether it is in C&#8217;s best interest to spend time with her family 12 times a year (in total). Some of the sessions could be joined by mother and grandmother (if their relationship at one particular time allows it).  The sessions can be shared at a ratio of 9 for grandmother and 4 for mother. I do not believe that a contact order is in C&#8217;s best interest as this is likely to reduce the Local Authority&#8217;s ability to protect her and promote her emotional wellbeing&#8230;</p>

She was concerned about rigid or formulaic thinking by the Local Authority but on balance did not support a defined order for the lack of flexibility that would impose, in particular if it met C&#8217;s welfare needs to have contact with other family members in due course. She did suggest inviting the Local Authority to vary the care plan on contact and in submissions the Local Authority agreed they would do so if that was my decision. She considered that contact should remain supervised; the concerns about MGM are that she would expose her strong views about the Local Authority and contact to C but once proceedings ended, with a clear plan for contact, a good working relationship with the foster carers, a clear written agreement and some work with MGM on child focused conversation that might be mitigated. However, that would not take place overnight but the benefit of supervised contact would be to assess compliance and there should be a new risk assessment of MGM to assess the risk in light of MGM&#8217;s changed position and following a period of monitored compliance with a written agreement. She recommended the Local Authority revise the care plan to make specific proposals for sibling contact recognising the likely longevity and importance of such a relationship.</p>

That will be kept under review by way of child in care reviews which the Local Authority confirmed MGM would be invited to. In those circumstances I prefer the Guardian&#8217;s evidence that contact with MGM and M should be monthly when combined (ie 8 for MGM, one joint and 3 for M). It is certain and sufficiently frequent with MGM to maintain the connection that is plain on the evidence (set out above). However both MGM and M need to be aware that it may need to reduce over time to take account of the needs of C to have contact with the wider family and potentially F. I found the Local Authority argument that it would be harmful to C&#8217;s welfare to set the annual combined contact at 12 only to have to reduce it in the event of possible wider family contact entirely failed to take account of the converse harm of setting at just 6 per annum with MGM with whom C has a strong bond and which has been regular and consistent.</p>
