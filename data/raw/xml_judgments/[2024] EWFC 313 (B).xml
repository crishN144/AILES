	<p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Unfortunately, Tom&#8217;s mum and dad have always found it very hard to agree about important decisions that need to be made for him, such as where he should live and when, and what schools he should attend. This is actually the sixth time that Tom has been the subject of a court case. Tom should know that this is a very high number, and not at all normal. It is also not his fault. </span></p>

	<p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The first three cases in 2013, 2015, and 2016 concluded with Tom spending a roughly equal amount of time with each of his parents and an order that he attends W Primary School. I then dealt with a case in 2019 that again looked at these questions. Tom turned 10 during this case, and I was presented with evidence as to what Tom wanted to happen. I was told that Tom wanted to move to live with his dad and change schools closer to where his dad lived. </span></p>

I was worried about what would happen to Tom&#8217;s relationship with his mum and Anna should he move to live mostly with his dad, and that Tom appeared somewhat confused as to what he wanted and why. I also thought that it was not in Tom&#8217;s interests to change schools, as the information I had was that he was happy and doing well at W Primary School.</span></p>

	<p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The fifth case about Tom took place in 2022, when Tom&#8217;s dad asked the court to decide where he should attend secondary school. Tom&#8217;s mum wanted him to go to X Comprehensive, whilst his dad preferred Y Comprehensive. It was also reported that Tom wanted to move to live with his dad, and so the court considered this question as well. </span></p>

	<p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This time the case was dealt with by a different judge, District Judge Andrews, but I have read through her decision. Judge Andrews also considered carefully what Tom was saying, but she too was worried about the impact on Tom&#8217;s relationship with his mum and Anna if he moved to live with his dad. She concluded that it was best for Tom to move with most of his school friends to X Comprehensive. Once this decision was made, Tom&#8217;s mum and dad agreed that Tom should continue living with each of them as he had done before. </span></p>

She is concerned that Tom reasoning in support of what he wants is unclear, and that he will suffer harm if directly involved in a legal battle between his parents. Tom&#8217;s mum understood that he would be very disappointed if I refused his application and would need support to accept this. However, she believed that things would be OK with a little time. Tom&#8217;s mum also thought that their relationship was currently better than it had been in a long time, and that they had all really enjoyed the time they spent together over the summer holidays. </span></p>

Although he considered Tom to be intelligent, thoughtful and engaging, he was really worried about the harm that might be caused to Tom and his relationship with his mother if he were allowed to carry on with his case. Mr. Fitzpatrick believed that Tom was under a lot of pressure, and needed support through therapy, not a court battle. </span></p>

When deciding this, I think about a range of issues, including Tom&#8217;s intelligence, his emotional maturity, his reasons for wanting to play a direct role, and his understanding of the process. I must also consider what risk of harm there is to Tom, whether that is by him being involved in a battle with his parents, or being excluded from the opportunity to have his voice heard in the most direct way. </span></p>

The evidence leads me to conclude that Tom, more likely than not, is a confused little boy. He is clearly acutely aware of the dispute between his parents, not least because he was physically involved in the incident on Mothering Sunday 2018, and it is no wonder, to my mind, that he has been guarded in his responses to questions posed by different people at different times. I consider that the actions of both parents, both directly and indirectly, have contributed to this and whether it be the mother&#8217;s reaction to the initial NYAS letter or father stating subsequent to that letter that the mother had learnt some form of lesson. I must bear in mind that this is a little boy of just 9 years old, 8 years old at the time that all the wishes and feelings work was undertaken, and it strikes me that this is a case where Tom is trying desperately to say what he thinks will tread the fine line of keeping everybody happy. Whilst I do not ignore what he says, in the context of this dispute, his stated wishes and feelings cannot be described as reliable, even far less so determinative, and as such, I attach less weight to what he says than I might otherwise do in the case of a 9-year-old in different circumstances.

I disagree strongly. The father must understand that Tom needs both of his parents to play an active and balanced role in his life in order to thrive. If the conflicts are put to one side, both are equally capable of meeting his needs. There is ample evidence within the s.7 report that Tom is happy and content in his mother&#8217;s care. If anything, I am more concerned that a transfer of residence to the father runs the risk of an unacceptable and harmful undermining of the mother&#8217;s role in Tom&#8217;s life. I refer not just to actions such as his unilateral decision to take Tom to visit two schools, or indeed enrol him in out of school counselling without his mother&#8217;s knowledge, but to [the evidence] that the father has been fostering in Tom an emotional dependency on him...&#8221;</span></p>

The father must recognise, and very quickly, the impact that this type of behaviour is having on his son. My views is that Tom is shielded from the full extent of the negative aspects of the father&#8217;s behaviour as a result of the time that he spends with his mother.</span></p>

Just to echo some of the advantages identified by Mr. Hall in his report, Tom is used to such an arrangement and there is no evidence that such a significant change in circumstances would be to his benefit. Tom has a half-sibling and it is of crucial importance that he is able to remain close as they grow together, and there is no reason to believe that Tom&#8217;s positive views and enjoyment of the time that he has with his father would diminish if that time remains broadly the same.&#8221;</span></p>

The inescapable conclusion that I have drawn is that the father has seized on this issue as a means to further his ultimate goal of having Tom spend more time in his care and is seeking to revisit the point on schooling that he unsuccessfully litigated in 2014. I do not say that he has deliberately engineered it, but I am far from being satisfied that the father has sought to react to those statements made by Tom in a way that will allow him to move forward within his existing school and help him build resilience&#8230;.</span></p>

In any event, it is recorded that the court urged the parents at the first hearing to consider whether there was any form of mediation and/or family therapy that they could participate in with Tom to address his concerns without the need for litigation. The father subsequently proposed the assistance of Family Mediation Cymru. Having met with both parents, FMC did not consider that the case was suitable for mediation. Although the court has not seen a record in support of this, the mother informed the court that FMC had reflected on the history of the case and concluded that Tom&#8217;s involvement in any mediation arrangement placed him at a risk of harm if he again felt his views were not being given primacy.</span></p>

The father effectively adopted a neutral stance, stating that he had no intention of making a further application of his own if Tom&#8217;s application failed. On behalf of Tom, it was said that he appreciated why the court might think there should be an enforced break in any litigation. However, he was unable to agree to a s.91(14) order being in place for an extended period of time, as he would have to think about GCSE options next year and wanted to undertake these at Y Comprehensive. Although it was not expressed as such, I took this to mean that Tom already had it in mind that he would try and persuade the court again (and soon) if he was unsuccessful on this occasion. </span></p>

There is undoubtedly a range of competing considerations for the court to assess and balance, but that is not unusual for a dispute of this kind. Had an application been put, I am not satisfied that the high bar of necessity would have been made out. </span></p>

With regret, I confess that I was not aware of the existence of this guidance at the point that the application was heard, for it is plainly an extremely important and helpful document. As its title suggests, the guidance is intended to assist solicitors in reaching a conclusion on whether a child has sufficient understanding and intelligence to be assessed as competent to instruct their solicitor directly without a guardian. Paragraph 14 sets out some fundamental principles, and paragraph 15 details a list of issues to bear in mind when making the assessment. At the conclusion of the document, there is a checklist of considerations, including prompts such as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;Have you considered whether there are any external influences?&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;Have you assessed the child has understanding of the issues in dispute?&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. </span></p>

With the benefit of hindsight, the court ought to have flagged this for consideration at the outset of proceedings. In any event, I am bound to query how Miss Smith was able to properly address core aspects of the checklist, such as those highlighted above, with the limited information that she had available to her at the point that she accepted the instruction.

Not only may the initial assessment be flawed, but the information gathered subsequently might be harder to analyse objectively and stand to be coloured by the previous determination. </span></p>

Understandably, she is concerned about the emotional and psychological impact of Tom advancing his own application, and agrees with Mr. Fitzpatrick that Tom requires therapeutic intervention to support his emotional needs.

A move at this point would be steeped in risk, and the court would inevitably require a good reason. I have formed the view that Tom&#8217;s desire to move schools without offering any real justification is a clear example of him simply parroting the views of his father, who has litigated to have Tom educated on his terms since he was as young as three years old. </span></p>

This might be indicative of Tom&#8217;s determination to see the matter through, but it is equally representative of his emotional naivety. In any event, no party has suggested that Tom should be present in court at any of the hearings to date, and I would anticipate that similar considerations would apply should the substantive application be permitted to proceed.

Even if steps were taken to mitigate the risks, such as a clear focus on explaining matters in a sensitive manner, it is difficult to see how this would not be harmful to Tom given that which he has already suffered because of the parental dispute. I am not clear the extent to which Tom truly understands this and its long term implications for his emotional welfare and family relationships. If Tom does feel a need to promote what is ultimately his father&#8217;s position, this is likely to add to the burden that he carries.

Tom has been set in his mind for many years, and his strength of feeling will not subside overnight.

The court has before it an intelligent 13 year old who has consistently expressed the same views for many years in respect of his care and schooling. This is not a case in which there are past findings of alienating behaviours on the part of the father, or in which there is reason to believe that Tom does not genuinely believe in the proposals he is putting forward. His desire that his voice is heard is perfectly understandable given the importance of the issues at stake, and if he feels excluded, this will likely cause him harm.
