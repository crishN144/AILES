The mother brought an application on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> January 2022 under the inherent jurisdiction for location and wardship orders.  She seeks the return of AM to Pakistan to her care and alleges that the father wrongfully removed her in 2019 and has deliberately refused to facilitate contact ever since.  AM has had no direct contact with the mother since their separation, albeit the father says there was intermittent contact up to Eid 2019.  There was one video call contact in 2020 and indirect contact has very tentatively recently begun.</p>

He bases this upon a number of allegations he has made against the mother.  These include the contention that the mother began a relationship with and married a dangerous man (&#8216;D&#8217;), who has threatened him and AM.  This forms part of their asylum claims.  </p>

They have provided conflicting accounts of how they came to be married, the nature of that marriage, who took care of AM and when, the circumstances leading to their separation and AM leaving Pakistan for the UK and, importantly, the reasons why AM has spent hardly any time at all with her mother since then.  The parents accept that they each were spending some time outside of Pakistan working during AM&#8217;s early years.  It is undisputed that in late March 2019 the father removed AM from Pakistan to take her to England where they have remained since.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reasons for the father&#8217;s departure with AM from Pakistan and for her estrangement from her mother are keenly disputed.  The father has said that the mother had agreed with the relocation and also that he had to flee because the mother&#8217;s new husband had threatened to kill both him and AM.  He has also claimed that he only ever intended to come to England for a business stay, subsequently changing his mind when circumstances changed.</p>

She describes a rigid marriage with the father wherein she suffered domestic abuse and that he exerted control over her.  In early 2019 she decided to divorce him, get a job in Pakistan to support herself and AM.  According to the mother, the father then abducted, or wrongly removed, AM.  </p>

He has alleged that the mother entered a bigamous marriage and, having conceived a child within that marriage, underwent an abortion.  He describes her in varying ways as neglectful of AM.  He believes that returning AM to the mother would be returning her to take up a life of prostitution and/or place her at serious risk from D and the maternal family.  The father claims that he has been prepared to encourage contact in England, but that the mother did not wish to take this up.</p>

The father considers that the mother remains in a secret relationship with D and he and AM are at risk as a result.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.38in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-size:11pt">AM&#8217;s early stages of her formative years have been very disruptive.  It appears that AM has received immediate care from several different family members and whilst resident in Pakistan she was primarily cared for by the maternal grandmother.  Therefore, although AM has remained within the family unit, it appears that she has not experienced consistent care from a primary care giver.  However, in experiencing the loss of her mother and extended family it would be expected that AM experienced feelings of abandonment, confusion and loss.  It has been difficult to form a clear understanding of AM&#8217;s earlier childhood experiences given the inconsistencies and differences within the parents&#8217; account.</span></p>

Having since received their statements and considered the information shared, it is evident that both [the father] and [the mother] have both provided inconsistent and at times confusing accounts.  During my meeting with [the father], although he was forthcoming with information, at times it was difficult to follow his narrative about the nature of events and I raised this with him on several occasions.  Whilst [the mother] was not forthcoming with information, she did provide a similarly inconsistent narrative.  However, during our meeting she withheld a lot of information and portrayed herself as a bystander rather than being directly involved.  When considering the accounts given by [the father] and [the mother], there are similarities.  However, the context of the information is presented very differently to suit their respective narratives.  </span></p>

He reports that it was [the mother] who brought danger to their family home primarily through her doings in Dubai and her new marriage.  Whilst he identifies himself as having continued to prioritise AM&#8217;s needs, hence his decision to leave Pakistan, [the father] was not able to recognise any positive aspects of [the mother]&#8217;s parenting or the importance of her role in AM&#8217;s life.  [The father] portrayed himself as being vulnerable within their marriage and he continued to place all blame on [the mother].</span></p>

In respect to the care and love for AM [the mother] did not appear to have the same motive of portraying [the father] in a completely negative light, which may reflect her own views, or her fears of repercussions within their community.  [The mother} reported experiencing domestic abuse, detailing an increase within the seriousness of the incidents which resulted in her ending the relationship.  However, [the mother] went on to disclose further accounts of domestic violence within her statement, including sexual assault towards her younger sister, who was a minor at the time.</span></p>

Whilst in her statement she goes into details of her relationship with D, it is evident from speaking to both parents that the involvement of D contributed to [the father]&#8217;s reasons for leaving Pakistan.  [The mother] describes [the father] as having orchestrated and coerced her into forming a relationship with D in order for them to benefit financially.  Within [the mother]&#8217;s statement she reports that D made a fake marriage certificate.  However, I struggle to understand what his motives would be for doing so.  It is agreed by [the mother] and [the father] that D did threaten to kill them, which [the mother] stated had been reported to the police.</span></p>

However, the risks they raise are of the most serious nature.  If [the father]&#8217;s reports are taken at their most serious, which is that AM would be murdered in the event that she returns to Pakistan, this does raise significant concerns.  Although it is agreed that threats have been made by D, the nature and severity of these remain disputed.  In order to make safe recommendations related to AM&#8217;s welfare it is important that the court determines the factual matrix.</span></p>

The father was given an opportunity to set out his objection to disclosure, but confirmed at the hearing before HHJ Woodward that he did not wish to oppose disclosure.

The court noted that the case presented as complex, involving international elements, very serious cross-allegations, including domestic abuse and abduction, and the child presenting at risk of very significant harm.

In this case, both the mother and the father have made allegations, in some respects overlapping, against each other on which they seek adjudications.  I bear in mind that in private law cases in particular the court needs to be vigilant to the possibility that a parent may be seeking to gain an advantage in the battle against the other.  This does not mean that allegations are false, but it does increase the risk of misinterpretation and exaggeration or fabrication.</p>

There is no pseudo-burden on either to establish the probability of explanation for matters which raise suspicion.  The standard of proof is the civil standard, the balance of probabilities.  The law operates a binary system.  So, if a fact is shown to be more likely than not to have happened, then it happened, and if it is shown not to cross that threshold then it is treated as having not happened.  I apply that principle with the common sense that the authorities encourage.  Sometimes the burden of proof will come to a judge&#8217;s rescue: the party with the burden of showing that something took place may simply not have satisfied that judge that it did.</p>

She thought that if she formally admitted to working in Dubai and this became public she would be viewed adversely and would be subject to ill-treatment in Pakistan from the father&#8217;s family and others as women are not generally permitted to travel abroad for work and can be treated adversely when they do so depending upon the family.

However, during her oral evidence she accepted that prior to this she was working for the father &#8220;on paper&#8221; and he assisted her financially.  Indeed, she accepted that with his help she opened an account as early as September 2013 and that he was transferring money to her prior to their marriage.  The mother, however, remained adamant that the marriage was nevertheless arranged and she really only saw the father properly for the first time at the wedding.</p>

However, in her April 2022 witness statement (see paragraphs 38 and 39), she said something very different and the clear implication from what she said in her statement was that this had all been a set up on the part of the father.</p>

She believed herself to be divorced and wished for me to view her separation ID card during the course of her oral evidence.  This was not in the bundle.  I asked her how she was able to get that card and she said that she simply made an on-line application and did not have to go through any formal process.

He was wholly unable to provide any cogent evidence in support of these allegations beyond malicious gossip.  If the father genuinely believed the mother, her sister and the grandmother to be involved in sex work and drugs it is difficult to see why on the father&#8217;s own evidence he permitted them all to live in his home for a very lengthy period of two years and why, when he was away from that home, on his own case he said he entrusted his daughter&#8217;s care to the mother&#8217;s sister.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have other significant reservations about the father&#8217;s evidence.  First, the information disclosed in the father&#8217;s asylum application includes matters relevant to his account as to why he felt he had to leave Pakistan with AM that he has either resiled from in these proceedings or is inconsistent with his evidence in these proceedings.  By way of example, in both the initial asylum registration questionnaire dated 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2019 and the preliminary asylum questionnaire dated 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2020 he clearly relied upon his fears in relation to not just D <span style="font-style:italic">but the mother herself</span>.  In the former questionnaire he said she wished to take over his properties and business.  In the latter questionnaire he said that she wanted to take AM from him.  The suggestion that the mother wanted to take over the father&#8217;s business sits very uneasily with his claim in the family proceedings that she was no more than sex worker.  The suggestion that the mother wanted to take AM from him is inconsistent with his claim at points that the mother consented to him bringing AM to the UK.  I do not accept his explanation that both of these matters were included in the asylum questionnaires by mistake.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These inconsistencies continued during the father&#8217;s oral evidence, where he sought to say on the one hand that he was waiting for the mother to re-join him and would welcome her back with conditions, yet at the same time suggesting that she, alongside D and her family members, presented a danger to him and AM.  In addition, during his oral evidence the father described two chilling and very serious incidents in February 2019 in which he said that D and/or his associates attempted to kidnap AM and actually then fired gunshots at his home in an attempt to kill them.  He was quite unable to explain why these serious matters were not brought to the attention of CAFCASS when he was asked about his relocation to the UK or set out in detail in the witness statements he provided for the family proceedings.  I note that these incidents are referred to within his asylum interview which took place on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April 2022.  That was around the very same time of the CAFCASS report.  I reject the father&#8217;s explanation &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he did not have the time</span>&#8221; to mention these very serious incidents, particularly since his own oral evidence was that he decided to leave Pakistan after the attempted killing.</p>

Ms Cull-Fitzpatrick pointed out the inconsistencies in what the father said and concluded that what is very clear is that the father has not supported AM to maintain a relationship with her mother and he has sought to irradicate their relationship and the mother from AM&#8217;s life completely.

He was unable to credibly explain how he could be said to be waiting for the mother to come to him and wishing for reconciliation whilst still maintaining that she remained married to and under the spell of a man as dangerous as D and to be also continuing to engage in sex work.  The father&#8217;s suggestion that the mother simply wanted &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">to take a selfie with AM and disappear</span>&#8221; failed to acknowledge the mother&#8217;s own sacrifices and determination to rebuild a relationship with her daughter during the course of these proceedings.</p>

It demonstrated a clear attempt to continue to play the dominant and domineering role wherein the mother would have to seek his approval at every stage of her actions as well as his forgiveness.  By way of example, he explained that he offered the mother the possibility of contact with AM in September 2021 in exchange for the mother moving away from the family home (and also her employment) for a period of four months, but she refused.  The father gave the clear impression that he was only prepared to countenance a relationship between the mother and AM on his own, very clearly defined, terms, which were entirely in his favour and left the mother utterly dependent upon him.  When it was put to the father that this would involve the mother being completely alone and away from her own family, he said that she could move away to live with her grandmother.  When it was put to him that that would not allay his concerns because he regarded the grandmother as also involved in sex work, he was unable to answer the question and simply said that the mother needed to start living a respectful life.</p>

His evidence that he articulated his repeated allegations regarding the mother being a prostitute in Dubai &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">affectionately, with love and care</span>&#8221; is utterly incredible.  He held extremely strong negative views which made him very angry indeed.  I do not accept the father&#8217;s denial of violence or controlling behaviour against the mother.

These allegations are entirely unrealistic and implausible.  The father even blamed the grandmother for AM being admitted to hospital because he claimed her diet was poor.  This is inconsistent with his own claim that the grandmother did not care for AM but the mother&#8217;s sister did.

	      <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:0.98in">It is likely, given the mother&#8217;s circumstances and her very unhappy relationship with the father, that she was tempted by D.  But I accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that there was never a sexual relationship and whatever relationship existed came to an abrupt end within a few days or weeks of returning to Pakistan.  She never married or lived with D.  The father&#8217;s firm belief that the mother remarried is based upon what D said to him.  However, D clearly had nefarious intentions regarding the mother.  The parties accepted that the Khula divorce certificate in the bundle regarding their marriage was false and was obtained by D with a view to orchestrating the mother to start a relationship with him;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:0.98in">The maternal family moved out of the father&#8217;s Lahore home on around 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2019, very shortly after the father returned to Pakistan on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January.  I do not accept the father&#8217;s evidence that AM was living at this time full-time with him.  It is to be noted that the father had only been back in Pakistan on his own case for just over a week.  In my judgment, it is much more likely that AM remained with the maternal family, as had been the status quo for a lengthy period of time, albeit she spent time with her father both at the maternal family home and the father&#8217;s home;</p>

The grandmother described going into the room they were in and intervening.  In my judgment, her evidence was very clear indeed and I accept her account of this incident.  The father denied that the incident took place on the basis that he was living at his home.  I accept that the father was probably living at a different home by this stage, but, in my judgment, it is likely that he visited the maternal family home from time to time in order to spend time with AM and did so on this occasion;</p>

I do not accept that the mother ran off with D to be his partner at this time or at any other time.  I note the messages that the father has relied upon between D and the grandmother and other family members.  But even taking that evidence at its highest, that does not undermine the finding that this mother did not enter into a relationship with D in a sexual way;</p>

[The mother] had gone to Islamabad to do some shopping and left AM with me.  [The father] came to collect AM, saying he wanted to take her shopping.  He then said he wanted to take AM to his village for the day and said he would return her in the evening.  [The father] asked me to give him winter clothes &#8230; I had no idea that [the father] would not return AM.  Two or three days later when I was at my maternal family home [the father] sent me a video and called me.  He asked me to guess where he was and told me he was in the UK with AM.  He then disconnected the call and blocked my number.  I immediately called [the mother] to inform her.&#8221;  </span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:0.89in">Now, whilst the grandmother may have got the timings slightly off because it may have been more than two or three days after the father removed AM that he made the call, I am satisfied that her broad recollection of events is accurate.  The mother&#8217;s description of what she did when she returned home to find AM missing is entirely plausible and credible, and set out in some detail within her witness statements.  By contrast, the father&#8217;s evidence as to what he said or did not say is fundamentally inconsistent, as I have already described.  He varied between there being an agreement between him and the maternal family, including the mother, for him to take AM to the UK and other explanations.  I therefore fully accept that the father wrongfully removed AM from the care of her mother and maternal grandmother;</p>

In my judgment, it is part of a deep-seated, controlling and manipulative instinct on the part of the father to airbrush the mother, unless and until the mother complied with the father&#8217;s own expectations of her.  The reasons offered by the father for doing so on the basis of the evidence before me are not credible and do not stand up to any serious scrutiny.</p>
