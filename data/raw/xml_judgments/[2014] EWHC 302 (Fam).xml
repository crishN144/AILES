	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none">On 16 January 2013 Mrs Jennifer Roberts QC, sitting as a deputy High Court Judge, gave judgment at the conclusion of an extensive fact finding hearing. The findings against the father are set out in paragraphs 181-182 and 184 of the judgment. The principal and most serious finding is that the father sexually abused A &#8220;on at least one, and probably more than one occasion&#8221; between December 2008 and November 2009. The father does not accept that finding nor any of the other findings made against him. </p>

He collapsed and in doing so fell heavily and banged his head. The paramedics were called and carried out various checks on him. They advised him that he appeared to have suffered a stress related collapse. Out of an abundance of caution, however, they wanted to take him to hospital for further investigations; he declined. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none">When I came into court it was clear the father was not well. He told me he was suffering a migraine but, nevertheless, he wished the case to proceed. I was clearly of the view that it would not be fair or appropriate to do so. Accordingly I adjourned the matter for six days to 6 February to enable the father to recover fully from his collapse. I am grateful to the father for his brief written submissions which he spoke to after I had heard closing submissions from counsel for the mother and for the children&#8217;s guardian. </p>

As Dr Derry suggests, it may also help A to reconcile her feelings about the father I order to make a decision about their relationship over time. However, I remain acutely aware of the father&#8217;s lack of insight into A&#8217;s needs and he continues to ignore the findings that have been made&#8230;.I would very much like to support A&#8217;s wish to have indirect contact from her father; given her experiences it is very much to her credit that&#8217;s he wishes this to happen and I hope it will help her reconcile her feelings about her father.

He regularly emails the school with request of a legal nature, quoting parts of law. The frequency of his emails make the school feel harassed by his actions. The number and frequency of his emails, both in terms of school time to manage and respond to them and in terms of emotional response due to the tone of his emails and the pressure to respond are particularly difficult to manage. As a result of his continual &#8216;litigation heavy narrative email correspondence&#8217;, the school has passed on communication to the S Education Legal Team who are responding on the school&#8217;s behalf.&#8221;</p>
