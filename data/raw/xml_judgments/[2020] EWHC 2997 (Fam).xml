The husband sought to set aside those orders following which, on his case, there would be no further financial bonds between him and the Respondent [&#8220;the wife&#8221;]. The wife opposed the husband&#8217;s applications. These applications were listed before me by order of HHJ Kloss dated 18 September 2020. I was told that the reason for transfer was because of the issues raised by this appeal, namely (a) should the court have allowed the wife&#8217;s 2019 application to amend under the slip rule a substantive provision within an order made in 2017; and (b) should amendment have taken place in circumstances where the order itself was no longer said to be extant. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I summarise the facts pertinent to the issues in these applications. The husband is now aged 60 years and the wife is now aged 58 years. They married in 1985 and had three children, all of whom are now adult. In 2014, after nearly 29 years of marriage, the parties separated. On 20 November 2015, DJ Wood approved an order in financial remedy proceedings which had been agreed by the parties. Paragraph 24 of the consent order made provision for periodical payments payable by the husband to the wife. Those payments were stipulated to end on the first of the following events to occur, namely (a) the death of either the husband or the wife; (b) the wife&#8217;s remarriage; or (c) further order. I note that, within the order, the wife was identified as the applicant and the husband as the respondent. Decree Absolute was granted on 24 November 2015 </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In October 2016, the husband applied to vary the periodical payments order on the basis that he could no longer afford to make monthly payments of &#163;2,100. In a letter to the court dated 20 April 2017, the husband made clear that he sought the discharge in its entirety of the periodical payments order. At about the same time as the husband&#8217;s application, the wife applied for enforcement of the periodical payments order. I have not seen a copy of that application as it has not been found on the wife&#8217;s solicitors&#8217; file. However, it is clear from the judgment given by DJ Wright on 27 April 2017 that substantial arrears of periodical payments had accrued since the husband had not paid the wife anything since July 2016. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Both applications were heard by DJ Wright at a hearing on 27 April 2017. The husband represented himself and the wife was represented by counsel. I note the husband was identified as the applicant and the wife as the respondent in the eventual court order. Following a contested hearing, the judge varied the periodical payments to provide that the husband was to pay the wife &#163;600 for each of the following seven months and then to pay her &#163;800 a month from November 2017 onwards. The judge also remitted a portion of the arrears, ordering the husband to make a payment of &#163;3,600 to the wife. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The judgment given by DJ Wright set out the context in broad terms at the time the consent order was made. This was a lengthy marriage during which both the husband and wife had made contributions which were regarded as being equal. The parties had agreed the terms of the 2015 consent order which had been approved by the court. DJ Wright accepted that the husband&#8217;s income had decreased from that envisaged at the time of the consent order and, accordingly, reduced the sum of periodical payments payable to the wife. The judge was, nevertheless, satisfied that the husband had an earning capacity greater than his present income and determined that it was inappropriate to discharge the order for periodical payments as the husband had contended. Paragraph 34 of her judgment stated as follows:  </p>

I am therefore not going to end this order for spousal maintenance as Mr C--- seeks. There is provision for review and there are trigger circumstances in which the order would end.&#8221; </span></heading>

On 1 August 2019, the wife through the solicitors then acting for her invited the husband to agree that the 2017 order be corrected. The husband refused, conveying this by email on 7 August 2019. On 22 August 2019, the wife applied to correct the 2017 variation order pursuant to the slip rule. Her application was made on the basis that there had been an error in the drafting of the order, namely that the order provided incorrectly for periodical payments to end on the husband&#8217;s remarriage rather than her own. The husband was given notice of that application and on 1 September 2019, he wrote to the court objecting to it. His letter made clear his belief that, upon his marriage, the periodical payments were to cease. He objected to the use of the slip rule which he understood to be for minor clerical omissions and typographical errors in court orders, saying <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230;This is most certainly not a minor error to me as it has far-reaching implications. My new wife and I have based our whole future on the income we have between us&#8230;&#8221;</span>. He expressed concern that the alleged error had not been detected by the wife&#8217;s legal team or the court at the time the order was made in 2017. </p>

These can be summarised as follows: (i) if the failure to comply with the relevant rule, practice direction or court order can properly be regarded as trivial, the court will usually grant relief provided that an application is made promptly; (ii) if the failure is not trivial, the burden is on the defaulting party to persuade the court to grant relief; (iii) the court will want to consider why the default occurred. If there is a good reason for it, court will be likely to decide that relief should be granted, but merely overlooking the deadline is unlikely to constitute a good reason; (iv) it is necessary to consider all the circumstances of the case before reaching a decision that particular weight is to be given to the factors specifically mentioned in the rules.

The task facing a judge is not to pass an examination, or to prepare a detailed legal or factual analysis of all the evidence and submissions he has heard. Essentially, the judicial task is twofold: to enable the parties to understand why they have won or lost; and to provide sufficient detail and analysis to enable an appellate court to decide whether or not the judgment is sustainable.

The requirement for accuracy in an order made otherwise than in open court is equally compelling because a party&#8217;s rights or entitlement to a remedy may be lost, or a party may be disadvantaged if the order is inaccurate. The erroneous 2017 order meant that the wife apparently lost her entitlement to periodical payments when the husband remarried, and the husband was financially disadvantaged in reliance on an inaccurate order.  Correction of accidental slips or omissions at any time is thus consistent with the interests of justice and the fair resolution of proceedings. </p>

On 17 February 1983 decree nisi was pronounced and on 4 May 1983 the marriage was dissolved by decree absolute. On 12 September 1983, the wife applied for financial provision which the husband countered with a plea of res judicata based on the consent order made on 9 February 1983. The wife challenged that order for want of jurisdiction as it was made before decree nisi was pronounced. A trial was held of a preliminary issue, namely whether the order made on 9 February 1983 was valid. Ewbank J ruled that the order was invalid or ineffective because <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss. 23</ref> and 24 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> provided that the power of the court to make orders for financial provision arose on granting a decree of divorce or at an time thereafter and not otherwise. He considered that the error might be corrected under the slip rule by amending the date of the 9 February 1983 order to 17 February 1983, the date of decree nisi. The wife appealed and the Court of Appeal held that the registrar had no jurisdiction to make the order on 9 February 1983 as it was made before decree nisi.

Put simply, an application to set aside an order based on mistake may be granted where the true facts on which the court made the order were not known by either the parties or the court at the time the order was made. In this case, there was no mistake as to the facts but there was an accidental error on the face of the order. I was not convinced that the principles derived from the case relied on by Mr Maxwell-Stewart could be properly applied to this application to correct under the slip rule. This was because the interests of justice in correcting an erroneous order outweighed the effect of delay in making the application especially in circumstances where rights had been lost. It also struck me as contrary to the interests of justice to require the wife whose rights had been extinguished or seriously compromised by an error on a court order to search for alternative and uncertain legal remedies outside those which would normally be available to her as divorced wife. The prejudice to her of not granting the application under the slip rule far outstripped any disadvantage to the husband. Finally, there was no comparable prejudice to third parties in this case as neither the husband nor his second wife had acquired an interest in property which was the subject of the disputed 2017 order. Property in this context cannot encompass an order for periodical payments. </p>

Paragraph 35 of her judgment made plain his ongoing liability for periodical payments to the wife. The judgment contained no discussion as to any variation of the trigger events which might bring that liability to an end. Neither did the transcript of the hearing. In the absence of anything that suggested that the District Judge was proposing to vary the trigger events terminating liability on the part of the husband to make periodical payments,  I am satisfied that the court&#8217;s intention was to maintain the trigger events contained in the 2015 consent order. In coming to that conclusion, I am also fortified by the nature of the error in the 2017 order. It arose because, in the draft submitted to the court for approval, counsel then acting for the wife adopted the wording of the original 2015 order instead of altering paragraph 1(b) to reflect the fact that the wife was the respondent in the 2017 proceedings rather than the applicant (as she had been in the 2015 order).  The error was wholly accidental and genuine though it was very unfortunate that it was not detected and corrected earlier. </p>

First, the discretion to correct an order must be exercised in the light of the overriding objective in FPR rule 1.1(1) which is to deal with cases justly. Just dealing required the court to correct an accidental error on the 2017 order which, if not corrected, deprived the wife of her entitlement to ongoing periodical payments and failed to give effect to the court&#8217;s intention. Second, the husband did have a remedy in respect of his liability for periodical payments, namely he could make an application for variation. That application would allow the court to examine his present circumstances alongside those of the wife and take into account, as a relevant matter, his reliance to his detriment on the erroneous 2017 order. Indeed, I note that the court is presently seised of precisely such an application. The passage in the October 2019 transcript cited in paragraph 12 above made plain that the District Judge took both those factors into account when reviewing her decision. Further elaboration by her was unnecessary. </p>

The husband was a litigant in person and relied on what was stated on the face of the 2017 order without apparently appreciating that the court had in no way altered the 2015 trigger events. The wife left court with an understanding that, though the amount of the periodical payments had reduced, nothing else had changed with respect to them. She was legally represented and, unsurprisingly, did not feel the need to scrutinise the order when it was approved. The husband&#8217;s letter in October 2018 would not have alerted her to the error on the </p>

That letter read as a polite if brief notification of the husband&#8217;s remarriage and gave no precise date for that event.  The letter to the wife on 28 February 2019, after the husband&#8217;s remarriage, did place her on notice that he would no longer make periodical payments in reliance on the 2017 court order. She consulted her former solicitors, and they wrote to the husband on 1 August 2019 about the 2017 order.  It is not disputed that the wife was suffering from cancer in 2019 and I consider that this might have understandably caused her to prioritise her health and treatment. In any event, I observe that any delay in applying for correction of the 2017 order may not, of itself, have operated to disadvantage the husband if he had already made new financial arrangements at about the time of his remarriage. </p>

The court will properly have regard to all the circumstances when considering such an application, but it seems to me that, save in the most unusual of circumstances, the interests of justice in correcting an inaccurate order are likely to prevail over other considerations. There was no good reason in this case not to correct the erroneous 2017 order.  </p>

I do so in the knowledge that both parties have been affected by the error on the 2017 order and sympathise with them both. The husband&#8217;s variation application will provide a proper opportunity for the court to scrutinise the parties&#8217; financial affairs and to make the orders it considers just having done so. </p>

This case did not cross the threshold of having a real prospect of success on appeal as the above analysis demonstrates. Additionally, there was no other compelling reason to hear this appeal. The absence of decided case law on this very narrow issue was insufficient to warrant the grant of permission and there was no important point of law which needed clarification. Whilst I do not doubt that this decision will serve as a salutary reminder to practitioners and judges to exercise great care in the drafting and approval of court orders, that circumstance alone cannot justify the grant of permission let alone the costs incurred by both parties. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.03in">Should the husband be entitled to an extension of time to make his application for permission? His application for permission to appeal was made very late indeed. The delay was substantial and there was simply no good reason for the husband&#8217;s failure to make a timely application. The fact that the husband was, until very late in the day, a litigant in person did not constitute a good reason for failing to comply with the rules. Likewise, the husband&#8217;s failure to seek legal advice until about eight months after the time for appealing the order of 14 October 2019 had expired cannot justify the length of the delay in this case. Finally, the wife has been put to inconvenience and expense in defending this appeal and, in uncertain health, had to await the resolution of this appeal before the husband&#8217;s variation application could be once more listed for financial dispute resolution. It remains to be so listed and is likely to be much delayed.  </p>
