	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This part of the claim and the proceedings is based on the inherent jurisdiction and relates to the interim injunctions that the claimant local authority obtained on a without notice basis against the second respondent (Mrs S) on 16 September 2004.  Time has passed, and other proceedings have been heard, since then but throughout Mrs S has maintained and preserved her argument that in obtaining those injunctions on a without notice basis the local authority acted unlawfully and did not adopt the correct approach.  This judgment deals with that issue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first respondent (Mr S) is now a 90 year old man who lacks capacity and who did so in 2004.  Mrs S is in her eighties. The underlying issue in the proceedings was as to where Mr S should live.  His condition and behaviour has changed during the proceedings.  The relevant primary care trust (PCT) was joined and proceedings for judicial review were also instituted.  The PCT accepted that Mr S was eligible for continuing NHS care and thus that it was responsible for funding his care and placement.  In May 2006 I refused to grant permission to Mrs S to judicially review the decision of the PCT relating to the placement of Mr S.  The results were that (i) Mr S was and remains placed in an Elderly Mentally Infirm (EMI) home and that placement is funded by the PCT, and (ii) the proceedings by the local authority under the inherent jurisdiction have become redundant save for the points as to the interim without notice relief granted at their commencement.  In my judgments in May 2006 I dealt with the approach to be taken to the two sets of proceedings and the different tests involved therein.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Throughout the hearings before me Mrs S was strongly of the view that Mr S should live with her at home with the assistance of a support package provided by public authority.  As I have already mentioned she did not achieve this result.  I pause to comment that I, and in my view the PCT and the local authority, were sympathetic to Mrs S&#8217;s view that she wanted her husband of many years to be at home.  I add that in my view during the course of the proceedings, and before they started, the public authorities involved (i.e. the local authority and then later the PCT) have made considerable efforts to promote what they considered to be the best interests of Mr S.</p>

It is common ground that at times his behaviour was very difficult and challenging and his care needs were extensive and included problems concerning incontinence and mobility.  Mr S is a big man.  He had been in and out of a number of homes and he and his wife had received support packages at home.</p>

There were, and always have been, very real difficulties in identifying a suitable home both as to the facilities offered and location.  Also, and understandably, there has been room for reasonable differences of opinion as to the suitability of a home, or aspects of its care or facilities, and the overall merits of it as a placement in comparison with a placement at another home or of Mr S at home with Mrs S with a support package.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 10 September 2004 Mr S was admitted to a nursing home. The immediate background to this was one of escalating difficulties.  Mr S had been at home with Mrs S from early August 2004 and as she says in her evidence she was getting very desperate with the support provided and the lack of respite care.  She handed a letter to the local authority on 9 September 2004 in which she sets out some of the recent history seen through her eyes and ends by saying she is exhausted, she can hardly walk, her blood pressure is getting very high and in capitals saying &#8220;please help&#8221;.</p>

They also gave Mrs S an envelope containing the court papers, psychiatric reports and the statement of the social worker (although as I understand it the claim form had not by then been issued) and gave her an explanation of the effect of the orders.  The statement describing the reaction of Mrs S has not been challenged.  It says that Mrs S was extremely distressed as evidenced by her raised voice and her pacing of the room.  The view of the social workers was that she did not accept or understand the terms of the order.  She stated that she was going to go and get Mr S and bring him home and there was nothing the local authority could do about that.</p>

The solicitor was not available and Mrs S (and, at the request of Mrs S, one of the social workers) spoke to a friend of Mrs S.  After that the social workers drove Mrs S to the nursing home where Mr S still was and she was present with social workers during his move to the K hospital.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Mrs S was served on 17 September 2004, it seems to me that nothing turns on the point that the local authority was given until 21 September 2004 to issue the claim form and serve Mrs S with the statement relied on in support of the without notice application.  I confess I do not understand why the undertaking did not require issue and service much earlier.  Even if time for issue had been appropriate, good practice would have required earlier service of the order with the supporting evidence (as in fact occurred).  The facts that Mrs S was served when she was and that the Official Solicitor attended for Mr S on 27 September 2004 have the consequence that nothing turns on the questions whether there was a need to add Mrs S as a party, as the order made on 27 September 2004 states was done, or whether this was a typing error in the order and it was Mr S who was then added.  They should both have been parties.</p>

In my view this can lead (and experience as the applications judge confirms that it does lead) to practitioners making without notice applications which are not necessary or appropriate, or which are not properly supported by appropriate evidence.  Also there is in my view a general practice of asking the court to grant without notice orders over a fairly extended period with express permission to apply to vary or discharge on an inappropriately long period of notice (often 48 hours).  It seems to me that on occasions this practice pays insufficient regard to the interests of both the persons in respect of whom and against whom the orders are made, and that therefore on every occasion without notice relief is sought and granted the choice of the return date and the provisions as to permission to apply should be addressed with care by both the applicants and the court.  Factors in that consideration will be an estimation of the effect on the person against whom the order is made of  service of the order and how that is to be carried out.</p>

As to that I accept and acknowledge that a reference to notice being given if practicable, or for a short period of notice (say 2 working hours or just two hours if a week end or holiday period is imminent), may often provide an appropriate balance to avoid a sequence of effectively without notice applications, and that in some cases a longer period of notice may be appropriate, and</p>

I appreciate that in many instances there is a very real urgency and there will not be third party evidence of allegations of abusive behaviour that are readily available but in others there will be.  A classic example, which occurs regularly, is that an applicant who seeks a return of children to his or her care fails to provide any third party evidence (e.g. from a school, a GP or records in their possession) to confirm that he or she is indeed the primary carer of the relevant children.</p>

Unless the discussion prompts the need for urgent and without further notice application to a court the decision is whether or not the public authority should either (a) raise a proposed course of action with the affected persons as a first step, or (b) as a first or early step make an application for without notice relief as part of, and to facilitate, the proposed course of action.</p>

For example he will look at the position from the perspective of the person who is said to lack capacity with an experienced eye and, by reference to the evidence relied on, comment as to whether in his view without notice relief would be appropriate and on the extent and nature of that relief.  His early involvement, particularly in cases where after investigation he agrees to take and does take an active longer term part, is also likely to be of assistance in the identification and planning of the steps that should be taken to obtain expert opinion and to enable the court to make a fully informed decision as to what would be most likely to best promote the welfare of the relevant person.  I pause to comment that the role of the Official Solicitor and his early notification of proposed proceedings and a without notice application may be affected by the practice and the rules of the new Court of Protection.</p>

But it seems to me that given the decision of the nursing home that Mr S must leave, and although it was not putting a time limit on that move which would have precluded prior discussion with Mrs S about it, it seems to me that the nursing home would have been keen to avoid argument and might well have co-operated in a move demanded by Mrs S.  Even if it had resisted the move whilst an emergency application to court was made in my judgment the view of the local authority that the attempt to move him would have been distressing and disruptive to Mr S, and indeed to Mrs S, was correct and reasonable. </p>

This is because it enabled that move to take place against the background of court orders rather than against a background of distress and opposition to the move followed by an order made on short notice against an elderly lady facing an emotionally daunting dilemma.  As I have said in my view the prospect that an accord would have been reached by discussion and without court intervention was low.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The benefit of hindsight in this case to my mind indicates that detailed discussion with the nursing home to ascertain its precise stance if Mrs S had been notified of the proposed move before relief from the court was sought might have produced helpful information and should therefore have been considered and pursued.  Having said that I hasten to add that on the written evidence it seems to me unlikely that such a discussion would have resulted in a decision that Mrs S should be notified before relief was sought or granted.  But it might have resulted in her being faced with a situation, agreed to by the nursing home, under which the proposal was that Mr S would not be moved for say another day (or perhaps two) to enable her to apply to the court to vary or discharge the order.  I acknowledge that this would have put her in a difficult position, for example in obtaining representation or assistance, but the situation was urgent.</p>

This is because the nursing home was not prepared to keep Mr S and the proposed move to the K hospital was in my view the only realistic immediate and short term option.  Also a return home from there was not likely to be any more difficult than one from the nursing home (or another nursing home). </p>

This may particularly be the case when it would be difficult to restore the position to the one that existed before a change supported by the without notice order is made.  An example could therefore be a move from a nursing home.  In such a situation, and even if the nursing home was adamant that the adult who lacked capacity must leave, it could be thought that without notice relief would promote the minimisation of distress to the relevant adult who lacks capacity from the immediate reactions of family members who oppose the proposed move, but that fairness and the correct balance would be promoted by those family members having an opportunity to put a different solution to the court before the proposed move took place.</p>
