	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Their relationship has been characterised by many separations and reconciliations.  On any view, it is, as Mr. Jarman terms it, a marriage with a very unhappy history.  The mother makes complaint of domestic violence; the father complains of the mother's infidelity.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">A striking and quite unusual feature of this case is that many of the salient background facts are agreed or uncontentious.  In particular, it is agreed that domestic violence has indeed characterised the marriage and characterised it throughout.  It is agreed that on at least one occasion, the Police were called in relation to an incident of domestic violence against the mother.  It is agreed that the children witnessed domestic violence and it is agreed that X was herself subject to violence by the father on two separate occasions.  In his statement the father says of this &#8220;I have no justification for this and deeply regret it&#8221;. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that it is also agreed that the marriage has been an unhappy one.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It is clear, and again it is agreed that the mother's abduction of the children in June of last year was carefully planned, though it was not communicated to Y until the day of the mother and children's departure for the UK.  It is common ground that at least initially on the separation, Y missed her father.  It is agreed that the children were, as of June last year, habitually resident in Hungary and that the father has rights of custody in relation to the children.  It is a fact that the children have only been living here, therefore, in the UK, for five-and-a-half months.  It is plain, certainly as far as Y is concerned, that she has relatively limited command of English.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">During the course of submissions, it was also recognised by Mr. Jarman on behalf of the father that the analysis of the CAFCASS officer, Mr. John Power, was largely impregnable and that his conclusions were, therefore, difficult to displace.  Mr. Power concluded that what the children told him about their family life in Hungary is more likely to be true than not true, and that a return to Hungary could be potentially intolerable, because historically Mother has proved unable to safeguard them whilst in situ there.  Her description of the violence shown to her by her husband is &#8220;he would regularly hit me, grab me by the throat and push me against the wall when he got angry&#8221;. On my evaluation of the evidence I consider this is likely to have occurred frequently in consequence of the Father&#8217;s volatility. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">How, then, do I approach the exercise of my discretion in this case?  It is undoubtedly the position that in Convention cases there are general policy considerations which have frequently to be considered alongside the individual interests of the particular children in the case.  The philosophy of the Hague Convention has been rehearsed in many of the authorities and is well-known.  It is predicated on the swift return of children who have been abducted. Intrinsic to this, is the principle of comity between contracting states and the mutual respect for the contracting states' respective judicial processes.  As Baroness Hale observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>, the Convention is also there to deter abduction in the first place, in order that the message should go out to potential abductors that there are no safe havens among the contracting states.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.47in;text-indent:0in">"As is clear from the earlier discussion, the Convention was the product of prolonged discussions in which some careful balances were struck and fine distinctions drawn.  The underlying purpose is to protect the interests of children by securing the swift return of those who had been wrongly removed or retained.  The Convention itself has defined when a child must be returned and when she need not be.  Thereafter, the weight to be given to Convention considerations and to the interests of the child will vary enormously.  The extent to which it will be appropriate to investigate those welfare considerations will also vary, but the further one gets away from the speedy return envisaged by the Convention, the less weighty those general considerations may be".</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0in">"In the child's objections cases, the range of considerations may be even wider than in the other exceptions.  The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met.  First, that the child herself objects to being returned, and secondly, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views.  These days, and especially in the light of Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989, Courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views.  Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so.  Once the discretion comes into play, the Court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections,  the extent to which they are 'authentically owned' or are the product of the influence of the abducting parent.  The extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry.  But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances".</p>

The best interests not only of children generally but also of any individual child involved are a primary concern in the Hague Convention process.  The exceptions to the obligation to return are by their very nature restricted in their scope and they do not need any extra interpretation or gloss.  It is now recognised that violence and abuse between parents may constitute a grave risk to children.  Where there are disputed allegations which can neither be tried nor objectively verified, the focus of the enquiry is bound to be on the sufficiency of any protective measures which can be put in place to reduce the risk.  The clearer the need for protection, the more effective the measures will have to be".</p>

He also recognised that the Hague Convention jurisprudence does not exist in an isolated sphere but that these cases draw upon the Family Court&#8217;s wider knowledge and experience of child welfare issues. Pertinently , all those involved in the family justice system have long recognised the profound and corrosive impact of domestic violence on children, both its immediate consequence and its insidious repercussions for children in late adolescence and adulthood.

Though she has plainly tried to separate on many occasions from the father in the past the mother has, in the complex dynamic of victim and perpetrator, consistently been dragged back into his orbit.  The clear inference I draw is that only by leaving Hungary could she finally free herself from this long standing abuse from which she had been unable to protect either herself or her children.  I emphasise that the impact on the children is not only emotional, itself serious enough, but in X&#8217;s case she was physically abused by her father.  It is a voluble and eloquent critique of their past lives that the children have emphasised the last few months as the happiest of times.     </p>

Collectively these       features, it is submitted, override both the risk of harm and Mr Power&#8217;s analysis of the welfare features of the case.  Sufficient protective measures can be put in place to protect the children.   The risk whilst it may be &#8216;real&#8217; Mr Jarman submits is not &#8216;grave&#8217; as contemplated in Re E (Children) (Abduction: Custody Appeal) [2011] UKSC27.

It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be &#8216;real&#8217;. It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as &#8216;grave&#8217;. Although &#8216;grave&#8217; characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two.

However, they do gain colour from the alternative &#8216;or <span style="font-style:italic">otherwise</span>&#8217; placed &#8216;in an intolerable situation&#8217; (emphasis supplied). As was said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span>, at para [52], &#8216;&#8220;Intolerable&#8221; is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean &#8220;a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate&#8221;&#8217;. Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress. It is part of growing up. But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself. Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent. Mr Turner accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: eg, where a mother&#8217;s subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child.</p>

As has often been pointed out, this is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person, institution or other body who has requested her return, although, of course, it may be so if that person has the right so to demand. More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home.

I conclude that these children are at grave risk of harm on their return to Hungary, primarily emotional harm but also physical.  They have been provided here with a shelter from that abusive environment, which this mother has, despite her efforts, simply not been able to achieve in Hungary.

The father expresses no understanding of the reasons for his behaviour and his violence is so entrenched (including a conviction for assaulting a nephew) that it is unlikely to be addressed effectively or at all within the timescales of these children.  Their wish to remain in the U.K. is expressed loudly and clearly.  Furthermore I believe that failure to afford it determinative weight, on the facts of this particular case would in and of itself be so disempowering that it would also be harmful, adding to the wider picture of harm that I have identified above.</p>
