P appears by her litigation friend, the Official Solicitor, represented by Jenni Richards QC. The Trust, with the court&#8217;s agreement, played no part in the hearing, although it has made some representations about the draft order submitted after lengthy negotiations following the hearing. M has appeared in person. I am very grateful to all the lawyers for their efforts in this difficult and troubling case, and also to M who has put forward the family&#8217;s case with great clarity.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background to the hearing can be summarised briefly as follows. P is a young woman with learning disabilities. She previously lived with her family but took part in a number of social and community activities. Concerns arose that, by reason of her learning difficulties, she was vulnerable to sexual exploitation, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). There is evidence that she was sexually assaulted and Dr D, expert, reported that the police expressed concern that P should not access the community unsupervised as she appeared to be a target for exploitation and was extremely vulnerable.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Some years ago an application was made to the court for an order that P be sterilised. In the event, it was decided not to pursue the application for sterilisation. Instead, consideration was given to providing P with long-acting contraceptive treatment and, if so, in what form and how it should be administered. The other main issue considered in the proceedings concerned the measures which should be put in place to protect P from sexual exploitation. Various psychiatric and other assessments were commissioned to inform the court. The expert evidence of Dr A, consultant psychiatrist, was that P lacked mental capacity to consent to sexual relations, to consent to contraceptive treatment and to litigate. Dr A further recommended that P should be supervised at all times when in the presence of sexually active men to whom she may be vulnerable unless and until it was established that she was able to make a decision with regard to sexual activity. It was further recommended that P should receive further education about sexual matters, in particular with a view to enabling her to protect herself against predators. Dr B, a specialist in community sexual and reproductive health, considered the various options for long-term contraception and recommended that it would be in her best interests for P to undergo the insertion under general anaesthetic of a copper inter-uterine device (IUD) which was envisaged to be effective for about ten years. It was proposed that this be carried out covertly under sedation, and that P should not be informed of the procedure. Following extensive discussion between members of the multidisciplinary team and legal representatives of all parties, a detailed plan was devised and submitted for approval by the court. There was some evidence at that time that P might acquire the mental capacity to consent to sexual relations and contraception if educational work was undertaken.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At a substantive hearing in 2012, Parker J made an order in which, having declared that P lacked capacity to litigate and to make decisions with regard to contraceptive treatment, she further declared that it was lawful for P (with or without her agreement) to undergo under general anaesthetic the insertion of a copper coil IUD, to receive a Depo-Provera contraceptive injection, to undergo a full sexual health screen, and to be subject to proportionate restraint if necessary including sedation. By a further order that day, the judge directed a further assessment of P&#8217;s capacity and the filing of further information as to the support package for her, with a view to a final hearing on a date to be fixed. Following the hearing, P duly underwent the operation for the insertion of the IUD. No reasoned judgment was given at the hearing in 2012 and, in the event, no further hearing took place for several years.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2016, the local authority made an application to restore the proceedings. The purpose of the restored application was several-fold: to revisit the question of P&#8217;s capacity to engage in sexual relations in the light of the work undertaken with her in the intervening years; to assess and evaluate the clinical risks to P&#8217;s health presented to her by any further pregnancy; to revisit P&#8217;s capacity to consent to contraceptive treatment; to re-evaluate the options for P&#8217;s contraceptive treatment in view of the fact that the IUD inserted in 2012 has a life of approximately ten years; to reassess the best interests decision not to inform P of the fact of the insertion of the IUD in the light of any improvement of her understanding; and to authorise P&#8217;s deprivation of her liberty at her placement, which hitherto had been unauthorised. Directions were given for, amongst other matters, the preparation of further expert evidence. </p>

		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;This option will allow P the opportunity to develop her independence and have the chance to start forming sexual relationships. This option is seen as the least restrictive whilst ensuring risks are minimised. It is felt that the IUD has not had a negative impact on P&#8217;s well-being as advised by the medical professionals. The IUD remaining mitigates the risk of further pregnancies. A decreasing care would enable P to take more control of her daily routines and promote the chance of forming meaningful relationships. This will be done under subterfuge as it was highlighted within the medical expert reports (Dr D) that informing P would be detrimental to her well-being and impact on her relationship with family and professionals.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the hearing before me in late 2017, the three principal issues between the parties were as follows. (1) Does P has capacity to consent to sexual relations? (2) If she does, what steps should be authorised to facilitate the relationship between P and her boyfriend, or between P and any other person with whom she wished to have a sexual relationship? (3) Is the proposed relaxation in supervision in her best interests? In addition, however, it was thought appropriate for the court to review wider issues concerning her treatment, including the question whether it should continue to be covert or whether P should be informed about it. Although there was a measure of agreement between the parties about some of these issues, it was thought appropriate for this court to set out its conclusions on all matters supported by a reasoned judgment, which as stated above had not been provided at the earlier stage of the proceedings when the treatment was first authorised. In addition, notwithstanding extensive negotiations between the parties for several weeks after the hearing, there remain a number of details within the draft order about which the parties have been unable to agree and on which I am therefore asked to rule.</p>

Thus the test for capacity involves two stages. The first stage, sometimes called the &#8220;diagnostic test&#8221;, is whether the person has such an impairment or disturbance. The second stage, sometimes known as the &#8220;functional test&#8221;, is whether the impairment or disturbance renders the person unable to make the decision. S.3(1) provides that, for the purposes of s.2, a person is unable to make a decision for himself if he is unable (a) to understand the information relevant to the decision; (b) to retain that information; (c) to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision, or (d) to communicate his decision whether by talking, using sign language or any other means. </p>

Ongoing sex education, coupled with consistent advice and boundaries from a family and those professionals involved in her care may enable her to gain further knowledge and be facilitated to act in a way that reduces the significant risk that she currently places herself at.&#8221;</p>

Dr D acknowledged that people with capacity sometimes choose to have sex with multiple partners but, in contrast with many such people, P does not have control over the emotional consequences of such actions. She understood, however, that people get into trouble from forcing sex upon others. Overall, however, Dr D thought that the course of sex education which had been provided to P had given her an increased understanding of sexual relations and that this education had had a positive impact on P&#8217;s understanding of the issues.</p>

On behalf of the Trust in this case, Mr Sachdeva QC submitted that the views expressed by a person lacking capacity were in principle entitled to less weight than those of a person with capacity. This is in my view true only to the limited extent that the views of a capacitous person are by definition decisive in relation to any treatment that is being offered to him so that the question of best interests does not arise. However, once incapacity is established so that a best interests decision must be made, there is no theoretical limit to the weight or lack of weight that should be given to the person&#8217;s wishes and feelings, beliefs and values. In some cases, the conclusion will be that little weight or no weight can be given; in others, very significant weight will be due.</p>

The fact is that all life involves risk, and the young, the elderly and the vulnerable are exposed to additional risks and to risks they are less well equipped than others to cope with. But just as wise parents resist the temptation to keep their children metaphorically wrapped up in cotton wool, so too we must avoid the temptation always to put the physical health and safety of the elderly and the vulnerable before everything else. Often it will be appropriate to do so, but not always. Physical health and safety can sometimes be brought at too high a price in happiness and emotional welfare. The emphasis must be on sensible risk appraisal, not striving to avoid all risk, whatever the price, but instead seeking a proper balance and being willing to tolerate manageable or acceptable risks as the price appropriately to be paid in order to achieve some other good &#8211; in particular to achieve the vital good of the elderly or vulnerable person&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">happiness</span>.

There is no risk of P sustaining an abdominal rupture as a result of a further pregnancy and the risk of a uterine scar rupture is very small (&lt;0.5-1%). Even if there were to be a rupture, the risk of death to P or the foetus are very small indeed. Dr E further advised that the general risks of pregnancy are enhanced to a small degree with each subsequent pregnancy, the risk being of contracting a &#8220;morbidly adherent placenta&#8221; whereby the placental tissues implant over the uterine scar making it difficult to separate at the time of delivery. In overall terms, the best indicator of risk of a subsequent C-section are any findings in relation to the previous one, and on this basis Dr E would not anticipate any major complications in P&#8217;s case of a C-section. The condition can usually be diagnosed in the course of antenatal care and appropriate plans put in place.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The covert provision of medication to an incapacitated adult is always an interference with personal autonomy and thus a very significant step. The covert insertion of a contraceptive IUD is, arguably, an even more serious interference with an individual&#8217;s personal autonomy and Article 8 rights. The recent rescission of Practice Direction 9E has removed from the Court of Protection Rules the special procedural rules requiring all cases of serious medical treatment of incapacitated adults to be brought before the court. At the date of this judgment, the Supreme Court is still deliberating the appeal from the decision of O&#8217;Farrell J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">NHS Trust v Y and another</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/qb/2017/2866" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 2866 (QB)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 2866 (QB)</ref>, which addresses the question whether it is mandatory to bring before the court the withdrawal of clinically assisted nutrition and hydration from a patient who has a prolonged disorder of consciousness in circumstances where the clinical team and the family are agreed that it is not in the patient&#8217;s best interests that he continues to receive that treatment. The ramifications of the rescission of the Practice Direction are therefore at present unclear. On one view, cases involving serious medical treatment now fall to be treated in the same way as those concerning any other issue concerning a mentally incapacitated adult. If so, it would only be necessary to bring such a case before the court either where there is a disagreement between professionals and/or family members as to what course is in the adult&#8217;s best interests or alternatively there is some other reason why it is thought appropriate to refer the matter to the court. Given the serious infringement of rights involved in the covert insertion of a contraceptive device, it is in my judgement highly probable that, in most, if not all, cases, professionals faced with a decision whether to take that step will conclude that it is appropriate to apply to the court to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of best interests, with P having the benefit of legal representation and independent expert advice.</p>

She submits that the principal advantage of telling P about the IUD would be to restore her autonomy and bodily integrity and end the significant interference with her rights. Although her wishes and feelings cannot be known on this issue with certainty, it is highly likely that she would be opposed to any covert treatment. Telling P about the presence of the IUD in a planned way would also avoid the risk of an inadvertent disclosure of the existence of the device. Given the high turnover of care and medical staff, it is submitted that there is a risk that a new member of staff working with P, perhaps in a medical emergency, may be unaware of the situation and reveal the truth. Preserving confidentiality about this issue may present other challenges to medical and care staff.</p>

I believe that she would lose trust in her carers and professionals who support her, in addition to her family members. I believe that P would become distressed at the thought that something had been done to her without her knowledge and consent. This may make it significantly more difficult for her to trust those around her in the future, leading to potential breakdowns in relationships, which would have a negative impact on P&#8217;s emotional well-being. I also believe that it will be more likely that she may engage in sexual relationships, if she believed that she had a form of contraception, placing her at risk of sexually transmitted infections if she did not use condoms.&#8221;</p>

Her key worker is concerned that there may be a risk that her current placement would break down should P discover that the staff at X Care Agency had withheld information from her. She thought that P would not understand that professional staff had acted in her best interests. Disclosure of the covert treatment would also jeopardise future relationships with medical professionals. If P were to be informed about the existence of the IUD, she would probably ask for it to be removed, and a refusal by professionals to comply with her wishes would further exacerbate difficulties in their relationship. It is submitted that the original decision to treat covertly was taken after detailed discussion and a court process which was thorough, careful and compliant with Article 8. It was justified by the great concerns about P&#8217;s sexual exploitation. It is submitted that there is no reason now for reversing this decision.

The need to take this course will be even greater if P is at that stage in a relationship with a partner with whom she is contemplating sexual relations. In other words, although I approve the plan to retain the IUD, and not to tell P about it at this stage, I regard it as imperative that professionals working with P keep this issue under review at all times and start planning now for ways in which further decisions about contraception can be taken in a way that includes P and respects her personal autonomy and human rights.</p>

They are matters on which the parties are in sharp disagreement. First, what steps, if any, should be taken to support P in having sexual relationships in future, including with her current boyfriend? Secondly, should the current regime of continuous 1:1 supervision be relaxed at all?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact that P has someone whom she now regards as her boyfriend and with whom she wishes to have a long-term relationship means, as Miss Richards put it in her opening submissions, that the possibility that she may wish to exercise a capacity to consent to sexual relations is no longer an abstract issue. Miss Richards rightly submits that, if P can consent to sex with any person and may wish to exercise that capacity in circumstances where the person with whom she wishes to have contact is someone with whom she has a benign and non-exploitative relationship, it would be a significant interference with her rights if she were not to be permitted to do so. On the other hand, Ms Richards also submits, rightly, that the court is entitled &#8211; and I would add obliged - to protect P from the risk of future harm, abuse or exploitation, provided that the risks are real, are not fanciful and that the measures put in place are pragmatic, common sense and robust.</p>

That case concerned a young man who had the capacity to consent to such relations but lacked the capacity to make decisions about whether or not an individual with whom he may wish to have sexual relations was safe, or the capacity to make a decision as to the support he required when having contact with an individual with whom he may wish to have sexual relations. The challenge for the parties and the court in that case was to develop a best interests framework which permitted the young man sufficient autonomy of decision-making and respected his right to private life whilst balancing the need to protect him from harm. Having considered a draft plan and submissions, I put forward proposals for the sort of measures that should be in the plan, as part of a collaborative process between the court and the parties, and identified five particular elements: (a) basic principles; (b) education and empowerment; (c) support; (d) intervention, and (e) decision-making. The details of my proposals, which were substantially included in ultimate care plan, are set out in paragraphs 56 <span style="font-style:italic">et seq</span> of the judgment.</p>

The plan includes measures to be taken to assist P in developing new relationships and facilitating sexual relationships alongside 1:1 supervision, and incorporates a flowchart of steps to be followed in the event that P starts a relationship.

The Official Solicitor considers that the circumstances are too uncertain and fluid for the proceedings to be terminated at this stage. There is also insufficient information about P&#8217;s boyfriend - for example, his level of functioning is unclear, as is the question whether or not he has the capacity to consent to sexual relations himself. In oral evidence, the local authority social worker acknowledged that, before the relationship between P and her boyfriend progressed any further, much more would need to be known about him and his circumstances, including whether he has the capacity to consent to sexual relations. It is clearly possible that the relationship may develop, but the Official Solicitor is concerned that this will need careful monitoring and believes that this should be done within the context of ongoing court proceedings. </p>

For the last six years, P has been subject to 1:1 supervision at all times. The local authority now proposes to begin a process of reducing that supervision, in accordance with P&#8217;s expressed wish to have more freedom and in the light of the statutory obligation, under s.1(6) of the MCA, to have regard to whether the purpose for which any act or decision is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person&#8217;s rights and freedom of action. P is said to be a very sociable person who enjoys having the opportunity to go out to social events, see friends and meet new people. Professionals wish to help her enjoy these activities without exposing her to the risk of further exploitation.</p>

It seems to me, however, there is much force in Miss Richards&#8217; submission that the current circumstances are too uncertain and fluid to justify bringing the proceedings to an end at this stage. My reasons for this conclusion are as follows.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, in contrast to the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">TZ</span> case, where all parties and interested persons were broadly agreed as to the direction of travel, there is a deep and sharp disagreement between the professionals and P&#8217;s family, in particular M, about whether any steps should be taken which might lead to P having a sexual relationship. I think it extremely unlikely that this disagreement will be resolved in the near future, if ever. Furthermore, there is clearly a risk that the disagreement on this issue may in fact damage the good relationship which M has with many of the professionals and workers involved in P&#8217;s care. It would be most unfortunate if this apparently good relationship were to be undermined by disagreement on this one issue. For that reason, there is good reason for the court retaining the role of arbiter. I acknowledge that court proceedings are a cause of stress for everyone, including the family, but I consider that the court has an important role to play at least at this stage in the process.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, it is plain that the decisions concerning P&#8217;s future relationships will be difficult. A balance will have to be struck between her right to establish relationships, which is an integral part of her private life which must be respected, and the need to protect her from harm. I accept M&#8217;s characterisation of P as extremely vulnerable to exploitation. Any comparison between cases needs to be undertaken with caution, but it is significant that, whilst the young man in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">TZ</span> case had been exploited as a teenager, he did not exhibit behaviour of the sort which P has displayed in the past and which is said to have contributed to her vulnerability. This is, in my judgment, a further reason why this aspect of P&#8217;s care plan needs to be monitored by the court, at least for the time being.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The final reason relates to the proposed relaxation of supervision. Whilst acknowledging the strong views and concerns expressed by M, I accept the professional view of the local authority and the Care Agency, endorsed by Dr D, that the proposed slight relaxation of supervision would be in P&#8217;s best interests and should be put in to effect. In my judgment, however, it should be put in place for longer than four weeks - I would propose three months - and then reviewed. If all has gone well, it is conceivable that the parties may agree a further relaxation. Realistically, however, that seems unlikely and in those circumstances there would have to be a further referral to the court. No one has suggested that a further personal welfare deputy be appointed to make decisions about this matter, so that any disagreement will have to be resolved by this court. Frankly, it is difficult to see at this stage precisely how far the relaxation of supervision can safely go. In those circumstances, it is plainly necessary for these proceedings to continue.</p>

In the absence of agreement on those issues, there will be no further relaxation of supervision, nor any unchaperoned contact between P and her boyfriend, until further order. </p>

The reason behind the local authority&#8217;s invitation is that it is argued that it should be clear to those reading the order in the future&#160;that it cannot require a particular level of services under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/23" uk:canonical="2014 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Care Act 2014</ref>&#160;or suggest that&#160;the Court of Protection has&#160;primary decision-making power about any future disputes about&#160;community care services to be provided to P. The Official Solicitor does not agree to the inclusion of this paragraph.&#160; He argues that, if, as the local authority asserts, these are not matters to be determined in best interests proceedings, then this recital has no place in an order in best interests proceedings.&#160; Moreover he contends that it is important that this order is, as far as possible, capable of being easily understood by non-lawyers (including family members and carers) and this recital is confusing and unhelpful in that regard. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, there is an issue as to which authority should be responsible for bringing the matter back to court if further decisions need to be made about the IUD. The local authority contends&#160;that an application concerning P&#8217;s health is an application for the health bodies to bring. The Trust did not appear at the hearing, but, in an email submitted some weeks after the hearing via my clerk, contended that it should be the local authority that should bring the matter back to court in such circumstances.<span style="font-size:7pt">&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>In the email, it is pointed out that the draft order gives no indication as to whether or not P&#8217;s ability to consent to sexual relations or birth control and her care plan will need to be re-examined if further decisions need to be made in relation to her IUD. On this basis, the Trust assumes that any further decisions relating to P&#8217;s IUD, including what is to happen once it requires removal between 2022 and 2024, will require an application to court to re-examine all of these issues. It is pointed out that, at present, the Trust&#8217;s role in implementing and monitoring the health action plan is narrow. Its focus is on ensuring the safety of the IUD from a medical perspective via implementation of the health action plan. The Trust has very little day-to-day involvement with P and her social circumstances which, as the draft order makes clear, are central to the reasons that the IUD is <span style="font-style:italic">in situ</span> under subterfuge in the first place. The Trust submits that the local authority, by virtue of the fact that it commissions P&#8217;s social care and employs the social workers that have developed P&#8217;s care plan, has day-to-day involvement with P&#8217;s social circumstances. It is therefore the Trust&#8217;s view that, if an issue does arise with the IUD, the local authority is better placed to make the application as it will have greater understanding of P&#8217;s wider social circumstances which ultimately will require addressing if further decisions in relation to P&#8217;s IUD need to be made. A further point made on behalf of the Trust is that the possibility of new commissioning arrangements over the next five years runs the risk of loss of institutional knowledge about P&#8217;s circumstances and that this is a further reason why it would be more appropriate to nominate the local authority as the appropriate body to bring this matter back to court. </p>
