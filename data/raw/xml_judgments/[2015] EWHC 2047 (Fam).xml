	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents met in 1996 in La Reunion, a French island in the Indian Ocean.  Administratively, La Reunion is an overseas &#8216;department&#8217; of France and is, accordingly, an integral part of the French Republic with the same status as the &#8216;departments&#8217; comprising the French mainland in Europe.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents never married.  From 1996 to 1998 the parents resided together in Bordeaux in mainland France before returning to La Reunion.  The mother alleges that from 1998 the father was frequently verbally and physically violent to her.  The mother contends that this verbal and physical violence continued during the course of her pregnancy with B and after B was born.  The mother has also made allegations that the father was physically violent to B.  The mother states that she did not report these allegations to the authorities as the father threatened her with greater violence if she did so and because the Police in La Reunion do not, she says, take the issue of domestic violence seriously.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father vehemently denies these allegations of violence and points to the fact that there is no evidence that the mother ever raised a complaint against him on La Reunion, to the fact that the documents evidencing the decisions of the High Court of St Denis on La Reunion with respect to B do not record any mention of domestic violence and, finally, to the fact that those documents show that the mother agreed contact arrangements between the father and B, which arrangements included his having contact with B for the duration of the summer school holidays in France.  The father also exhibits to his statement letters from friends of his and the mother, the family&#8217;s doctor and B&#8217;s teacher stating that they saw no evidence that the mother or B were the victims of physical abuse.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">B was born on La Reunion.  The mother states that after B was born she left the father, residing initially with her Aunt in Le Port on La Reunion.  The father contends that the parties separated in 2007.  The mother states that she facilitated contact between B and the father for two years following the parents&#8217; separation.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As alluded to above, there have been proceedings with respect to B in the High Court of St Denis on La Reunion.  In 2008 the mother applied to the High Court of St Denis for residence of B and parental authority for him.  In the interim the mother contends that the French court ordered contact between B and his father for one or two weekends per month although I have not seen an order to this effect.  The mother contends that this contact impacted B adversely.  The mother further contends that during this period the father failed to contribute financially for B.  Once again, the father denies these allegations and maintains that he continued to have a good and unrestricted relationship with B following the parents&#8217; separation, with B acting as a page boy at the father&#8217;s wedding to his new partner in 2009 (with whom the father has two children, half-siblings of B whom B has yet to meet).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 11 March 2009 the High Court of St Denis on La Reunion made an order incorporating an agreement reached between the parents.  Under the terms of the order parental authority was to be exercised by the parents jointly pursuant to Article 372 of the French Civil Code.  The order further provided that B&#8217;s residence would be the mother&#8217;s home and that the father would have access.  Finally, pursuant to the agreement between the parents, the order provides that the father pay maintenance in the sum of 150 Euros per month.  The father points out that the order of 11 March 2009 gave him rights of custody in respect of B.  This is not disputed by the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 19 December 2010 the mother asked the father to leave B with her in order that she could take him to see a Christmas tree erected at her place of work.  On that day the mother instead removed B from La Reunion to New Caledonia, a French overseas territory and not part of the French Republic.  The mother moved in order to take up a new job.  The mother now concedes that she obtained neither the father&#8217;s consent, nor the permission of the High Court of St Denis for the removal of B from La Reunion to New Caledonia.  Prior to the first day of this hearing, and save by means of Skype during the currency of these proceedings, the father has not seen B since December 2010.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It would appear that before the mother&#8217;s departure with B to New Caledonia on 19 December 2010 the parents had been in discussions regarding the mother moving with B to mainland France.  An order of the High Court of St Denis dated 20 April 2011 shows that on 11 January 2011 the court recorded a petition by which the parents brought proceedings before the Family Court to have their agreement on procedures for exercising joint custody approved &#8220;based primarily on the mother&#8217;s departure to mainland France.&#8221;  In the circumstances, it would appear that the mother&#8217;s removal of B to New Caledonia was not only without the father&#8217;s consent but in direct contradiction of the arrangements the parties had been discussing immediately prior to that removal.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother states that she contacted the father from New Caledonia at the end of January or February 2011 once she had in place a Skype connection.  The mother contends that the father was angry and threatening during this contact and made a threat to end her life.  This is denied by the father.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother states that the father did not ask about where she and B were and that she did not volunteer this information.  The father denies he failed to enquire regarding B&#8217;s whereabouts and states that whilst in response to his questions the mother denied being in New Caledonia this was strongly suspected.  The father made enquiries of schools in New Caledonia but whilst he received confirmation from one school that B had been attending, the school stated that B had left.  I note that the order of the High Court of St Denis dated 20 April 2011 records that at the hearing of the parents&#8217; petition on 14 March 2011 &#8220;a move by the mother to New Caledonia was suspected&#8221;.   In the circumstances, the evidence tends to suggest that following the mother&#8217;s departure to New Caledonia the father had strong suspicions regarding the mother&#8217;s whereabouts but did not know with any certainty the location of B.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s evidence is that B spoke to the father from New Caledonia on at least four occasions whilst she and B were in New Caledonia with each of those phone calls being ended because father&#8217;s behaviour was abusive and threatening.  The father states he managed three telephone conversations with B in the period shortly after the mother removed him to New Caledonia and denies being abusive and threatening.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the hearing of the parents&#8217; petition on 14 March 2011 the High Court of St Denis made an order 20 April 2011 giving the mother permission to move with B from La Reunion to mainland France.  The order notes the address of the mother in mainland France as being the mother&#8217;s home in Marrolles en Brie, a suburb of Paris.  The order stipulates that B&#8217;s place of &#8216;habitual residence&#8217; would be at that address.  The order granted the father access to B during the summer school holidays in mainland France and when the father was present in mainland France.  The order confirmed the father&#8217;s parental authority.  The mother contends that she was unaware of the outcome of that hearing by reason of her being in New Caledonia.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the hearing in April 2011 the father states he believed that the mother and B were in mainland France. I note that as of 7 June 2011 the father sent a maintenance payment to the address in mainland France given by the mother in Marrolles en Brie.  That letter was returned to the father undelivered.  On 19 July 2011, following there being no communication from the mother regarding summer contact, the father made a complaint to the French police.  In October 2011 the fathers Avocat wrote making complaint to the Procureur de la Republique.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a result of the complaints to the police and to the Procureur de la Republique extensive enquiries as to the whereabouts of the mother were made, including enquiries by Interpol.  However, whilst revealing that the mother had lived at several addresses, and suggesting at one point that the mother was contemplating a move to Canada, these enquiries failed to locate the mother.  The mother has singularly failed in her evidence before this court to provide particulars of her and B&#8217;s whereabouts and their moves during this period.  The enquiries by the French police eventually revealed that the mother had been residing at a number of addresses in London.  </p>

At one point the French Ministere de la Justice commenced proceedings under the Hague Convention 1996.  Within the course of these proceedings, the High Court of England and Wales made nine disclosure orders and the English police visited four addresses before the mother was found. </p>

As for B&#8217;s situation in the house, the Guardian relates that there is one double bedroom and, whilst the mother told the Guardian that she and her partner sleep on the sofa and B uses the bed, the Guardian doubted that B has use of the one bed in the property.  Of particular significance to the Guardian was B telling his father during the contact that has taken place at court that his watch was in a suitcase and he could not find it.

The mother states that whilst she takes B to school, it is the mother&#8217;s partner, Mr K who collects him each day.  B&#8217;s attendance at school is below average at 91.9% and he has missed school when the mother is ill as there is no one to take him in such circumstances.  The mother has not been able to attend any parents&#8217; evenings for B as her work precludes this.  The Guardian also points out that the mother&#8217;s work hours preclude her from being available for B after school to assist with homework and talk to him about his day.  Because the mother works six days per week B stays with friends from church on Saturday mornings.  These people do not live in the area and one of them often travels to France.</p>

Whilst the mother ascribed B&#8217;s comment to a conversation in the home regarding a potential holiday in Canada, I agree with the Children&#8217;s Guardian that the reference to the cheaper cost of living speaks to B having heard conversations regarding a move that is intended to be more permanent.

The mother however submits that the settlement defence under Art 12 is made out on the basis that, as to physical settlement, B is settled at school, in his football club, in his church community and within the context of his mother&#8217;s stable job and stable relationship.  She further submits that were the court to accept that international contact could be facilitated between the father and B, this would import emotional and psychological stability for B in this jurisdiction going to the future.  The mother also submits that the defence of objection is made out on the basis of what she contends are B&#8217;s objections within the meaning of Art 13.  The mother also relies on the Art 13(b) defence of harm or intolerable situation.  The mother invites the Court to assume the allegations made by her in respect of the father&#8217;s alleged domestic violence towards her and B are true and submits that the undertakings offered by the father are insufficient in this context.  The mother further submits that to return B to France in circumstances where she has nowhere to live and no current means of securing an income would place B in an intolerable situation.  Finally the mother relies on an Art 20 human rights defence.  Ms Renton contends that B has a right to family life with Mr K and also with what Ms Renton terms the wider community.  Within this context Ms Renton submits that returning B to France would constitute a disproportionate interference with the Art 8 rights of B and, in such circumstances, is not permitted under the terms of Art 20.</p>

The house is in dire need of repairs which have not taken place.  The house has one bedroom for a family of three people.  I accept the evidence of the Children&#8217;s Guardian that there must be doubt about whether B in fact has a bed.  Coming as it does at the end of a long line of house moves, and whilst it represents a physical location, I am not persuaded that it represents B being established in an environment or a level of security and stability conducive to establishing the defence of settlement, nor does it again represent a situation that imports stability when looking into the future.</p>

Not only is there what B has said in this regard, in which it is plain he was talking about a proposed move that extended beyond a mere holiday, but there is evidence that the mother has indicated as much previously and there is cogent evidence of a history whereby the mother moves between countries, primarily motivated by job prospects.  In light of this evidence, and in my judgment, I am not persuaded that England represents an established environment, nor a level of security and stability nor a situation that imports stability when looking into the future.</p>

However, this evidence in my judgment only goes so far.  I also have regard to the fact that the mother and B live in a property with no neighbours with children in the immediate area and approximately 40 minutes from the school that B attends and at which the mother has never attended a parents&#8217; evening, that B told the Guardian he has one best friend at school and one best friend outside school, that B does not have friends with whom he attends football club, that neither the mother nor Mr K have family in England and that B has no relationship with any members of the family on his father&#8217;s side and none from his mother&#8217;s side, leaving him very isolated and dependent on his mother and Mr K.

If I so find, then I must ask myself how B can be protected from such risk by assessing what protective measures might be available and their efficacy dependent on the facts of the case.

Article 20 is not incorporated into the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref>.

In this way, the court is bound to give effect to the Convention rights in Hague Convention cases just as in any other. Article 20 has been given domestic effect by a different route.&#8221;</p>
