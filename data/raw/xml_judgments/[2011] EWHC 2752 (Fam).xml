The investigation was to be received by the court by 15 September 2011 at the latest: otherwise the agreement (and presumably the order) was to last until such time as the questions had been resolved through a judgment or decision which had gained legal force.</p>

They arise in the following way. On 11 August 2011 the father applied on a without notice basis to HH Judge Barnett sitting in this building as a judge of the High Court. He directed that the matter be listed for argument as to jurisdiction during the week commencing 22 August 2011, and that the Swedish Central Authority, pursuant to Article 55 of BIIR should provide to the English Central Authority any information which it had as to the mother and M&#8217;s location and whereabouts, and any information it had in respect of all child protection or other welfare proceedings taken or otherwise involving M.</p>

On 29 September 2011 the father made an application that M should be made a ward of court. On the same day, and again on a &#8220;without notice&#8221; basis, Bodey J warded M and made a location order. He ordered that the mother was not to remove herself or M from the jurisdiction without the court&#8217;s permission: he directed that the father&#8217;s solicitors disclose the papers in the case to the legal department of Northamptonshire County Council and adjourned the case to 3 October 2011.

I make no criticism of him for that, and quite see that from the father&#8217;s perspective, the situation is highly unsatisfactory and frustrating. His case, in essence, is that the mother only fled England to avoid a detailed enquiry, the institution of care  proceedings and the likely removal of M from her care at birth by Northumberland County Council; further that she is a liar who suffers from a long history of mental health problems and has also misled numerous medical professionals about her physical health; that she has recently disavowed any intention of living permanently in Sweden and, despite her protestations to the contrary has led a peripatetic existence, a principal purpose of which has been, and continues to be, the hitherto successful attempt to prevent him playing any part in M&#8217;s life.</p>

The disclosure from the various local authorities largely related to 2007, prior to M&#8217;s birth. Swedish Social Services had become involved: they had conducted a careful investigation and were satisfied with the mother&#8217;s care of M. There was no evidence that M had ever come to harm. In addition, there was abundant evidence in the papers that the father also suffered from mental health difficulties</p>

Once seised that court retains jurisdiction even if the child changes habitual residence during the course of the proceedings. This is the principle of petuatio fori. It is a practical rule to prevent one party from aborting proceedings by a tactical move during their course. Thus it can be argued that the issue of Children Act proceedings fixed jurisdiction in London until the termination of the proceedings.&#8221;</p>
