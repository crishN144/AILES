To cause such injuries the shaking must have involved excessive force beyond reasonable handling. Inflicting such injuries would have caused G significant pain and suffering, caused him to have intensive and intrusive medical treatment and leaves him at risk of long-term neurological damage. As a consequence, the local authority has brought these proceedings under s.31 Children Act 1989 seeking public law orders in respect of both children.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The burden of proving the allegations made rests upon the local authority. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. There is no burden or pseudo burden upon a parent or other carer to prove a negative case. Findings of fact must be based upon the evidence, including inferences that can properly be drawn from the evidence, and not upon suspicion or speculation. The evidence has to be evaluated in its totality including the relevance of the various strands of evidence to each other. The roles of the court and the expert are distinct. Whilst appropriate attention must be paid to the evidence of the medical experts, their opinions must be considered in the context of all of the other evidence. Experts advise but the court decides. In assessing expert evidence, the court must be careful to ensure that each expert keeps within the bounds of their own expertise and defers, where appropriate, to the expertise of others. </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The court is likely to wish to place considerable weight upon the evidence of the parents and other carers and the impression it forms upon them, their credibility and their reliability as witnesses. The court must always be mindful of the fallibility of memory, the possibility of &#8216;story creep&#8217; and the pressures of giving evidence. Recollections may change over time without any attempt to deceive, so contemporaneous evidence will often have significance. There is a danger in relying too heavily upon demeanour. </span></p>

Such reasons can include shame, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear or distress. Lies upon collateral matters may have less significance than those upon matters central to the court&#8217;s determination. It is for the court to assess the forensic significance of lies and the probative weight, if any, to be attached to them. Lies are only capable of amounting to corroboration where they are deliberate, relate to a material issue and are motivated by a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In every case of alleged non-accidental injury the court has to be alive to the fact that unlikely events do occur. Medical science may not provide a definitive answer to each and every case. Today&#8217;s medical certainty may be discarded by the next generation of experts. A consideration of unknown cause has to be factored into every decision-making process. It is not always possible to identify the cause of injury to a child. There will always be &#8216;outlying&#8217; cases where the answer to what has happened is simply unknown or, to put it succinctly, is not capable of proof on the balance of probabilities. </span></p>

Only if it is unable to do so will the court then proceed to consider whether there is a real possibility that each individual on the list inflicted the injury in question. </span></p>

She reported there was blood in his nappy. The mother noticed that on occasion he had been struggling to catch his breath. He was quiet, sleepy, pale and not behaving normally. She called 111 and brought G to the paediatric emergency department. He vomited in hospital but was discharged. Examination was unremarkable and this was felt likely to be constipation followed by early gastroenteritis. His temperature was recorded as 37.9. He was unwell over the next couple of days and the mother called 111 again on 31 October. The mother reported that G was vomiting, was short of breath, floppy and had not been eating. The 111 operator called for an ambulance and G was brought back to hospital. It was reported that G had been vomiting, was very lethargic and quiet. He appeared very pale with mottled skin on his hands and leg. There were spots of blood in his nappy (later considered to be urate crystals). His temperature was again recorded as 37.9. All basic cardiorespiratory examinations were normal and G was described as alert. The examination showed him to have no abnormal neurology with good tone and normal power in his limbs. There was no evidence of acutely raised intracranial pressure. The hospital doctors considered that G was likely to have gastroenteritis. He was admitted to hospital and placed on an iv drip. He tolerated small feeds with no vomiting. On 1 November he tested positive for Parainfluenza type 1 virus. He was discharged from hospital on 2 November. At that stage G was said to be feeding well, pink in colour and well perfused. </span></p>

They reported G to have been crying inconsolably and then, all of a sudden, to have become floppy. He was not responsive. He was breathing quickly and noisily. He looked like he was shivering or jerking. His eyes rolled back in his head. He can be heard crying noisily (or even angrily) in the 999 call but interspersed with periods of quiet. When the ambulance crew arrived they were able to wake G who cried but was consolable. He was alert and reacting appropriately. He vomited twice, projectile vomiting, including in the ambulance and vomited again on arrival to hospital. On examination he was mottled with raised heartbeat but was active on handling and alert. He had normal tone and his anterior fontanelle is described as normotensive. He was treated with fluids and antibiotics. He was discharged from hospital on 9 November. By that time he was said to be doing well, eating and drinking with no further vomiting. He was noted to have influenza and parainfluenza. One of the treating clinicians noted that G had perhaps a slightly increased tone on the left side.</span></p>

He was still awake at midnight. At about 4.30 am his father was holding him and noticed his leg was twitching then his arm began twitching and he began to drool. He appeared to be vacant. His parents called 111. It was reported that G had been unwell with a stomach bug. He had not been right since his release from hospital on 9 November. He started twitching again whilst his mother was on the phone to 111. 111 called for an ambulance. The ambulance crew reported a temperature of 38.4 degrees. Examination by the crew showed G to be alert with a normal conscious level. G had another fitting episode at hospital. He is reported as looking pale and mottled both centrally and peripherally. There was initially good tone, normal power and no abnormal neurology on examination. He then seemed to fall silent with his head turned to the right and not fixing or following &#8211; likely a short seizure. The working diagnosis was a seizure, potentially a febrile seizure, and G was admitted. No bruising was noted. G was treated with antiepileptics. An urgent CT scan was requested followed by, the next day, an MRI scan revealing subdural bleeding (as set out below). As a result, a referral was made to Children&#8217;s Services. He underwent a lumbar puncture but the test results were normal. His temperature remained above 38 degrees and G tested positive again for parainfluenza virus on 23 November. A child medical was undertaken in relation to R on 25 November which was normal. </span></p>

Subdural haematoma is a widely recognised sequala of abusive head trauma. It can result from a forceful shaking mechanism of injury with linear / rotational forces applied and with or without impact against a soft semi-yielding surface. The forces involved would be well outside what any reasonable carer would consider to be normal handling, but the precise forces cannot be known quantitively. The origin of spinal subdural haemorrhage is not entirely clear. The spinal subdural space has no bridging veins as an origin for the bleeding. There are competing theories that divide experts. A proposed mechanism of blood tracking down from the intracranial compartment into the intraspinal compartment is supported by some and resisted by others. The alternative hypothesis involves direct injury to the local structures within the vertebral canal. Dr Hogarth&#8217;s view is that he is open to either explanation and it may be that both are valid. Scanning of babies spines is not routinely undertaken so in terms of causation there is an element of the unknown. He would be much more comfortable in saying this was tracked blood if he could see clear evidence of blood in the posterior fossa. This is because the blood would have to follow a circuitous route from above the tentorium. It is possible for blood to track without leaving any deposits or any deposits that are visible. All he can provide are educated guesses on that topic. </span></p>

He accepted that if he is wrong and there is blood in the posterior fossa and / or the interhemispheric space as identified by Mr Jayamohan then that would support the tracking explanation.

Equally, he cannot rule out a birth related injury. Most such injuries resolve within a month but it could be longer than 3 months. In the vast majority of cases the blood will be reabsorbed but there is no reason to say birth related subdural bleeding behaves differently from bleeding from other causes.

He was unable to confirm the existence of a thin subdural collection within the posterior lower lumbar theca (intraspinal). On any view the change is very small.

It is an anatomical possibility for blood to travel from the head down into the lower part of the spine. Given the small volume present there it is possible that this has left a trace in the upper part of the spine not visible on the images. The effect of being on a ventilator would be positive pressure with oxygen and air being pushed into the lungs. When children are ventilated the positive pressure in the central nervous system, together with the fact the child is laid flat, increases the potential for blood to track from the head to the spine.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In his view the potential overarching explanation for these findings is trauma. None of the subdural collections show the appearance of very fresh bleeding. Once there is the potential for mixing of different ages of blood it can become difficult to ascribe an age to the density found. The origin of the subdural bleeding seen over the cerebral hemispheres may date back as far as birth. Instrumentation, such as forceps, carries with it the highest risk of subdural bleeding from birth. If G has vascular fragility, then this would further increase the risk. The evidence from the Whitby, Rooks and Looney papers would suggest that such bleeding should dissipate and be reabsorbed after approximately 4 weeks. The risk of a birth related bleed remaining and becoming chronic is, in his view, an unlikely but potential explanation in this case. The creation of membranes (&#8216;neo membranes&#8217; because they are not part of the existing membrane structure) is rare and unusual but not impossible. If they occur with other causes of subdural bleeding there is no reason to believe birth related subdural bleeding will behave differently. Birth related bleeds are known to have the potential to be asymptomatic (he has clinical examples of this having occurred). Going against such a proposition is that G&#8217;s head circumference centiles do not change between birth and 9 weeks old. If a birth related subdural bleed was to become chronic it would be expected to change the head circumference centiles upwards as it became older and larger in volume. He noted that at 16 December the head circumference remained at the 91</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">st</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> centile when there was clear evidence of bilateral subdural collections so these were not causing ongoing increasing volume issues. There were no signs of acutely raised intracranial pressure at the time of admission and the seizure activity would not therefore appear to be related to such pressure. The seizure activity (noted right from birth) was likely then to have come from brain tissue dysfunction directly. Whilst he could see no evidence of established brain tissue injury on imaging, it is possible that there was an abnormality or else the seizure activity is unrelated. The other possibility that would need to be considered and would explain &#8220;pretty much all the findings in this case&#8221; would be that G was subjected to multiple episodes of trauma with a progressively worsening presentation each time. </span></p>

If there is an injury to the brain tissue (as he believes he sees on the CT scan) then this would explain the clinical changes and raises the concern this has been caused by an injury. He accepted that there are other potential causes of such abnormalities including seizure activity itself, although that is more usually seen on an MRI scan rather than a CT scan. Meningitis was effectively excluded by testing. If such injury was there it was likely to be very acute because it had disappeared by the time of the MRI scan. He thought that if the seizure activity had been caused by injury then this should be established injury so one would expect to see it on the MRI scan.

That would be concerning for a neurological cause. Normally membrane formation would take at least 2 weeks so the time is a little short for such an event to explain the results of the CT and MRI scans on 18 and 19 November. However, there could have been multiple events since birth. The diagnosis of hEDS gave rise to a theoretical risk that G would have membranes that would break and re-bleed. If that accelerated the rebleeding process, then that could accelerate membrane formation and in that event it was more likely that a timescale of 6 November for the causation of the older injuries could fit.

Gene testing undertaken on his direction did not identify any genetic mutation associated with cerebral bleeding or Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (&#8216;EDS&#8217;). Testing revealed G to be a carrier for a gene associated with a rare genetic condition known as MCADD. However as is only carrying one such abnormal gene (the second copy of that gene is normal) this has no relevance for G as a potential explanation for his presentation.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Dr Saggar identified a clear family history of a connective tissue disorder in keeping with a hypermobile spectrum disorder, or hEDS (formally known as EDS type III). Diagnosis of this condition cannot be made from gene testing (at present) so this is a clinical diagnosis based on history and examination. The history for G comes from both his maternal and paternal sides and G has at least a 50% risk of having inherited this. On examination there was some evidence to suggest G had inherited minor aspects of it. He had a Beighton score of 6/9 (6 and above is abnormal), fine hair texture, easier bruising after the taking of blood, multiple bruises on his skin and a high / abnormal palate. hEDS may predispose G to a greater degree of bruising and / or bleeding. It is, says Dr Saggar, a controversial issue as to whether a lesser force is required to cause cerebral bleeding in children or adults with hEDS. It is his clinical experience that such patients do not present with spontaneous internal bleeding and he has not seen subdural bleeding described in patients after normal handling or even rough handling. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">If birth is considered as a plausible event giving rise to subdural bleeding then a child with an inherited susceptibility to easy bruising may bleed more easily at birth. Dr Saggar did not know whether hEDS affects propensity to bleed but we do know that the healing process is unusual with hEDS. hEDS is a form of vascular fragility rather than a bleeding disorder. The impact of hDS therefore on propensity to suffer a birth related subdural bleed, for that subdural bleed to become chronic and for rebleeding to take place in unknown, however as a matter of logic and common sense it may have an impact. There are no studies about birth related subdural bleeding on babies with hEDS. However, there has to be some form of trauma initially to cause the injuries because even children with hEDS do not bleed spontaneously. </span></p>

He reported that the haematology and biochemical tests undertaken for G were essentially normal. He does not believe that the reported episode in the buggy on 26 October going over rough ground was sufficient to cause intracranial bleeding. Subdural bleeding can be caused by a difficult instrument delivery, but G&#8217;s birth APGAR scores were very good and his newborn examination was normal making this less likely that his delivery had resulted in significant intracranial bleeding. The other possible explanation would be multiple shaking episodes although this would be in the absence of any rib or long bone fractures or retinal haemorrhages often seen together in episodes where a baby has been shaken. Clinically when the intracranial haemorrhages occurred G might have cried initially in pain and remained irritable afterwards or may have had a depressed conscious level and reduced feeding and may develop limb shaking or twitching. If caused by shaking the force required would be significant and not within normal handling. Overall, he considers that G sustained an inflicted injury from shaking. There were likely to have been repeated episodes but at the lower end of the level of force given the absence of other possible injuries from a shaking episode such as rib or long bone fractures and retinal haemorrhages. There was likely to have been an incident close to the time of presentation on 6 November and another incident between 6 and 19 November.</span></p>

He had a big head circumference at birth so he did not consider that head circumference helped when considering the likelihood of G having had a birth related subdural bleed. He agreed that the high pitched cry G which was said to have come from G could have been neurological and may have been the result of a re-bleed following an episode of trauma. He accepted that there can be a crossover between neurological and other symptoms. Flu does not normally cause neurological symptoms unless it causes encephalitis. He agreed that G has to be looked at through the lens of a child with hEDS and that there is no research about hEDS children in the context of birth related subdural bleeding. He agreed that the parents had presented G appropriately to hospital on each occasion when he appeared to have become unwell. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">When he was asked to consider why he preferred injury as an explanation rather than a naturally evolving phenomenon Dr Elias Jones explained that was his &#8216;gut opinion&#8217;. He accepted the possibility of a birth related subdural bleed and there could have been re-bleeding into the previously established haematoma and could not discount the possibility this would have been spontaneous. However, he believed trauma to be more likely. He wondered whether given the absence of other injuries there could have been &#8220;innocent episodes&#8221; where the carer did not believe they were doing anything beyond normal handling. He gave an example of a carer throwing a baby up in the air and catching them. No-one can be sure what degree of force is required to cause subdural haemorrhaging. </span></p>

His previous mental health issues had never been associated with violence or temper. He described himself as someone who is patient and calm. He does not raise his voice or get angry. His first priority is his family. He did not tell the doctors at hospital about his mental health because he did not think they needed to know his whole life history. G was on a ventilator at the time and it did not seem appropriate to go into that level of detail. He did not disclose his history in 2011 to the social worker completing the s.47 investigation. It was only when preparing his statement that his solicitor told him he needed to go right back in time and share his whole mental health experience. </span></p>

They did not go far but the walk included a stony path on the way to a children&#8217;s playground. For a few seconds the path meant it was a little &#8220;jolty&#8221; in the pram but she did not think anything of it at the time. G did not cry out or react in any way.

Undoubtedly, on the evidence of Mr Hogarth, G did have a chronic subdural haematoma with the potential therefore for re-bleeding.

The court must ask whether the intraspinal bleeding is evidence of a separate injury or represents blood tracking from the subdural bleeding in G&#8217;s head. It would be a mistake to assume that the constellation of features in this case must have a single unifying cause. The clinical symptoms relied upon are non-specific and there is no clear scanning evidence of brain injury. There is evidence that G had an elevated temperature on occasions which supports the existence of a separate medical cause, such as a virus, for G&#8217;s clinical presentation.

He questions why the father did not disclose his full mental health history to the treating clinicians or to children&#8217;s services when they were conducting their initial s.47 Children Act 1989 enquiries. If, on the expert evidence, subdural bleeding did not cause the clinical symptoms exhibited by G then he questions what did cause those symptoms. On the evidence of Mr Jayamohan one plausible explanation would be brain injury sufficient to cause symptoms (encephalopathy) but not sufficient to show up on the scanning images.

There were 4 hospital admissions: on 28 October, 31 October, 6 November and 18 November. On many, if not all, of those occasions G was seen to be unwell with vomiting and appeared pale and mottled in colour. His symptoms seemed to settle in hospital, but he did not revert to being entirely well. From just after birth the parents noticed G twitching and this became much more marked on 18 November. The clinical judgement in hospital on 18 November was that G was suffering from seizures. The impression of the treating clinicians before 18 November had been that G had gastroenteritis and also a viral infection. He had tested positive for parainfluenza on 6 November. He had a raised temperature on 18 November and tested positive again for parainfluenza on 23 November. The CT and MRI scans on 18 and 19 November showed subdural bleeding of different ages and (according to Dr Hogarth) a small amount of bleeding in the intraspinal area. There was evidence of neo-membrane formation indicating a chronic subdural haematoma. His EEG was normal. </span></p>

Previously it had been thought that subdural haematomas were uncommon in term babies. These studies established not only that subdural bleeding was more common than thought following the birth process, but that they occurred after all forms of delivery. There is some discussion within the papers as to whether instrument led deliveries more commonly cause such bleeding. The exact mechanism as to how birth causes such bleeding is unknown and, indeed, there may be more than one potential mechanism to explain, for example, how normal caesarean births can also lead to asymptomatic bleeding. The papers conclude that such bleeding normally remains asymptomatic and resolves spontaneously within 1 month or, at the outside, 3 months. The sample numbers are, however, small so it is not possible to be certain that all birth related bleeding will spontaneously resolve within such a time frame.</span></p>

The first two are interrelated. Dr Hogarth interprets the images as showing a small slither of acute blood in G&#8217;s intraspinal region. This could be further evidence to support the assertion of trauma as a unifying cause. He considers it to be possible, although less likely, that this is evidence of blood tracking down from the nearest site of injury, which would be behind the occipital lobe. He would be more confident of the tracking theory if there was blood in the posterior fossa or interhemispheric space. However, he acknowledged the limitations of the scanning images he had seen so there might be small deposits of blood between G&#8217;s head and intraspinal area which would evidence blood having tracked along that route. Mr Jayamohan was not convinced there is in fact blood in the intraspinal area. He understands what Dr Hogarth is referring to, now it has been pointed out, but this was not something he saw himself when he first considered the images. Conversely, he can see blood in the posterior fossa and the interhemispheric space so he is more confident as to the potential for tracking. He raised the enhanced potential for tracking given that G was on a ventilator prior to the scans having been undertaken. </span></p>

Mr Jayamohan believes he does see it on the CT scan but that it has disappeared on the MRI scan. Whilst he had considered whether the brain injury might be the cause of G&#8217;s left sided seizures, in the end the transient nature of that injury meant that he considered it to be more likely that it was a result of the seizure activity rather than the cause.

It also includes injury to the brain substance of which there is no evidence beyond the transient damage which Mr Jayamohan believes he can see but discounts as an effect of seizures rather than a cause. If, as the local authority alleges, there were episodes of injury shortly before G&#8217;s hospital admissions on 6 and 18 November then these are unlikely to explain the presence of neo-membrane formation which would require at least one earlier episode of injury. So that would mean at least three episodes of shaking which caused no injury beyond the subdural bleeding.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The wider canvas is also important. As set out above, there are no markers in this case to suggest that these parents, or the MGM, would be capable or likely to cause injury to a very young baby on multiple occasions. They have impressed all the professionals that have worked with them. They have co-operated fully with the process, despite how hard that must have been for them. Mr Storey is right to point out that if anyone has a propensity to lose their temper or control then 14 months of local authority intervention and complex court proceedings would be likely to test that to the limit. Each has remained calm and dignified despite the challenges.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">It is understandable why the local authority and Guardian have wished to explore with the father (and with other family members) the father&#8217;s mental health history. There have certainly been times when he has struggled both before meeting the mother and also after R was born. However, the inferences that it is appropriate to draw from his history are limited. The court must be careful not to allow an inquiry looking to establish propensity to become prejudicial or even discriminatory. There is no evidence of the father causing harm to anyone other than himself or threatening to do so. There is no evidence of loss of temper or control. There is no suggestion that he has harmed anyone in the past, let alone a young baby. He has been open to the court about his history. He has sought appropriate help and treatment when needed. He tells me he has developed an increased sense of awareness of his own mental health, the triggers to any deterioration and the steps he needs to take when he feels there to be a deterioration. He described becoming an advocate for mental health awareness in his own workplace during the covid pandemic. I ask myself why I should not believe him when he tells me that he would never let his mental health deteriorate to the extent that he would harm someone he loves.</span></p>

I was impressed by each of them. Their sense of family and their love for each other was palpable. I did not get the impression that any of them were trying to deceive me or the other professionals in this case. I do not think there is anything in the point that the parents did not provide complete details of the father&#8217;s mental health history until he provided his statement in these proceedings.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I heard evidence from the father and again watched him throughout the hearing. He was an impressive witness. He came across as gentle and calm. For him to have harmed G he would have needed to have done so against his own character on multiple occasions. I heard him describe going downstairs with G on 6 November. There did not appear to be anything inappropriate in the way he was carrying G. He was only away from the mother for a very short period of time with her remaining in the bathroom bathing R. If he needed the mother&#8217;s help he could have asked for it. Neither describes any particular stress, tension, argument or anger having occurred. It was just a normal day. G had been difficult that day but babies are difficult sometimes and these were not first time parents. I ask myself whether it is likely that the father would have shaken G when downstairs when there was no particular reason for him to do so. I do not think that it is. </span></p>

The mother was next to him in bed. He could have asked her for help if he was struggling. She struck me as someone who would willingly be called into action to help if she was needed. Again, I ask myself whether it is likely that the father would have shaken G that morning and done so when in bed with the mother without her noticing. Again, I do not think that it is. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">At the conclusion of the case, as I have said, no party advanced a positive case against the MGM. Even if they had, I would have rejected the proposition that she had harmed G or there was a realistic possibility of her having done so. My impression of her, as with the parents, was wholly positive. There did not appear to me to be anything inappropriate in the walk with G in the pram on 26 October. I cannot see her having harmed G by shaking him and, in any event, on the expert evidence such an assault would need to be accompanied by further assaults by someone else on later occasions. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I find myself in the position, as described by judges in a number of the published cases, of being unwilling to make findings of culpability against these parents and / or MGM unless compelled by the other evidence, including the expert evidence, to do so. None of the experts in this case were willing to rule out natural cause. Dr Hogarth went further and said that he was unwilling to say it was more likely than not that this was inflicted injury. All the experts readily conceded there are limits to our understanding of the complex medical issues that arise in this case. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I readily acknowledge, as I have throughout this judgment, that there are elements to this case that do not fit easily with a naturally evolving birth related subdural bleed. In particular, there are the clinical symptoms which are likely, on the evidence of Mr Jayamohan and Dr Elias-Jones, to have a different cause. It is a puzzle as to why G&#8217;s clinical symptoms appear to have resolved with the change of primary carer. There is a question as to whether what the parents describe as a high-pitched scream on 6 November 2022 is evidence of a neurological event. However, the court has to be cautious about ascribing too much (or even decisive) weight to a single piece of evidence. In complex cases of this nature, it may not always be possible to find an answer to every question or resolve every part of the evidential puzzle. Medical knowledge and understanding do not always permit easy answers or indeed any answers. We know more now than we did before the research undertaken into birth related subdural bleeding and we know more about hEDS. However, there is still much to learn. In any event, there is a danger in looking for a single unified explanation when there may be a number of factors operating independently to create the clinical picture and medical findings. </span></p>

For the reasons given above I am not persuaded that this is what happened to G. Accordingly, the local authority has not discharged the burden of proving that G sustained significant harm attributable to the care of a parent or other carer within the meaning of s.31 Children Act 1989. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The MGM was represented before me pro bono by Ms Crampton. This instruction was arranged through Advocate. This is a charity set up through the Bar Council to assist members of the public who need free legal help. It is wholly dependent on barristers agreeing to give up their professional time for free and is dependent on charitable donations to meet its running costs. Inevitably demand outstrips supply. In this case Ms Crampton gave up 11 days of her professional time (and additional time no doubt for preparation) to represent the MGM. I commend her for doing so. I am told that others have acted in a similarly generous way in other long cases. However, this would not be necessary if legal aid was available for a grandparent facing allegations in public law proceedings in the same way as it is for a parent. I understand that means testing meant that the MGM was not eligible for legal aid funding and would have had to sell her home to afford to pay for representation. Many grandparents (and other carers alleged to have injured children) find themselves appearing before the court in complex cases of this nature unrepresented. The consequences of findings being made against them can be life changing. </span></p>
