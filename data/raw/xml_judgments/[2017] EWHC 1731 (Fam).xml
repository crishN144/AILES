	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Last year a mother, acting in person, issued an application and commenced proceedings in relation to two of her children.  Not long afterwards she applied for those proceedings to be dismissed, and consented to their dismissal.  They were dismissed.  She has since said that, in applying for, and consenting to their dismissal, she was acting under very powerful duress and she now seeks that the dismissal order is set aside so that her application and proceedings are reinstated. The relevance is that the original application was issued at a time when this court undoubtedly had jurisdiction to make orders in relation to these children. If these proceedings cannot be reinstated, it is arguable (although I make no determination in this judgment) that there would no longer be jurisdiction for fresh proceedings to be issued, starting now. </p>

	  <num>2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The current issue is whether I should, indeed, set aside that dismissal order on the ground of duress.  As I have already indicated to all parties, I intend to do so.  In my view this is, on its facts, a very clear case indeed in which, however unusually, the court both can, and should, set aside its earlier order on the ground of duress.  The purpose of this ex tempore judgment is to narrate the essential facts and context and to give my reasons.</p>

	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Precisely because this is, in my view, a very clear case for setting aside the earlier order on the ground of duress, whatever may be the precise reach and scope of the jurisdiction to do so, I wish to stress that I do not, by this ex tempore judgment, intend to describe in any exhaustive or authoritative way the precise reach or scope of that jurisdiction.</p>

	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The essential factual context is as follows.  The father of the children concerned is an Iraqi who, however, lived for many years in England and became a British citizen.  These parents met and married and have two sons from their marriage.  The elder is now aged about 14 and a quarter, and the younger has very recently attained the age of 12.  They lived together here in England.  The boys were both born in England.  They are British citizens, and until the events last summer, which I am about to describe, they had always lived in England.  They went to school here and they were clearly completely socially integrated into England.  It is beyond peradventure, and not suggested otherwise, that at any rate until last summer they were always habitually resident here in England and Wales.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Sadly, the relationship between the parents broke down some years ago.  At that point they separated and the children lived with their father. [SOME DETAILS REDACTED] So it is that neither of the boys have lived with their mother for several years.  After these parties were divorced the mother remarried although, sadly, that marriage, too, has now ended in divorce.  From that marriage she has twin daughters, now aged four, who are, of course, the half siblings to the boys with whom I am directly concerned.  Those twin daughters do live with their mother.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There came a time in 2015 when the elder of the boys ceased living with his father and moved to live with his maternal grandmother.  The circumstances in which that happened are contentious and not directly relevant to anything I have to decide.  It did result in the father issuing a set of proceedings in 2015 designed to achieve that that son returned to live with him.  It is the case that there has been considerable litigation involving these children for now  an appreciable period of time.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Last summer, in late July 2016, both parents, together with their two sons and also with the mother's twin daughters, all travelled to the Kurdistan area of Iraq in which the father's own family live.  They had return flight tickets.  The mother says that she was led by the father to believe and understand that they were merely travelling there for a holiday of a few weeks as they had been accustomed to doing every other year or so.  As I understand it, that was also the understanding and expectation of both the boys,who thought that they would be returning to resume their lives in England at the end of a short holiday.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It may indeed be that that was also the expectation and intention of the father himself when they first travelled to Kurdistan.  However, the mother says, and I accept, that after about two weeks the father made plain to her that he and the boys would be remaining permanently in Kurdistan.  He said that she and her daughters were welcome to remain there too, if she wished.  The mother did not so wish.  She managed to return to England with her two daughters.  </p>

She paid the prescribed fee of &#163;215.  Within the application she stated that the nature of the order she sought was "return order with a penal notice and passport order".</p>

On her without notice application he made an order that the two boys be made wards of court and that they must be returned to England and Wales forthwith.  He fixed a further hearing date on 25th August 2016 before himself, again sitting in London.  Also on 19th August 2016 Keehan&#160;J made a passport order directed to the Tipstaff in the prescribed standard form.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is to be noted that in a passport order in the prescribed standard form then in use, there was no express prohibition in express terms against a respondent leaving England and Wales, although there was an express prohibition against the respondent removing or knowingly causing or permitting the removal of the children concerned from England and Wales.  However, it is absolutely plain from the provisions of paragraphs&#160;8 and 11 of the passport order, which I have deliberately quoted at some length, that the purpose and intended effect of a passport order is to prevent a respondent from being able to leave England and Wales.</p>

On that occasion the mother in fact attended by a telephone link from Manchester.  The father himself was in England on that date and was personally present in the court room here in London, together with his counsel, then as now, Mr&#160;Jeremy Rosenblatt.  The father applied to Keehan&#160;J to discharge the entirety of the order he had earlier made on 18th August 2016.  That application was expressly dismissed.

The father has since said that he managed to exit England and Wales on Eurostar, for which purpose he must have obtained a ticket in flat breach of the terms of paragraph 11 of the passport order which I have already quoted.  He says that after he had exited this country he travelled into Europe, managing to use his driving licence as a sufficient identity document in place of his passport until he was able to obtain a replacement passport or other emergency travel document from the Iraqi Embassy in Germany.  At all events, the father made his way back to Kurdistan in patent disregard of the purpose and intention of the passport order in relation to himself, which Keehan&#160;J had been asked to discharge but had expressly refused to discharge on 25 August 2016.</p>

The father did not attend, in clear breach of paragraph 4 of the order of Cobb&#160;J of 2nd&#160;September 2016 which he had clearly seen even on the day it was made.  He was, however, represented by counsel instructed by the same dedicated solicitors who had represented the father throughout these proceedings and still represent him today.  The mother, who by that stage had never instructed any solicitors at all, appeared again in person.  The formal order made by His Honour Judge Jordan at the end of that hearing recites that the mother attended court that day.  The father did not attend and remains outside the jurisdiction with the subject children.  The recital continues:  </p>

The court is further satisfied that the mother is content for the children to continue to live in Kurdistan with their father.

It is, of course, perfectly possible that if the mother has been fabricating her account as to threats, which I will describe more fully in a moment, then she may have deliberately narrated that fabricated account to the social worker.  The only significance that I attach to that statement by the social worker is that it does indicate that the evidence which the mother now gives with regard to threats by the father is not of recent invention.  She was clearly telling the social worker as long ago as mid August last year  that the father had made threats of taking the children "elsewhere" if she did not change or retract her statements to the court. </p>

A hearing did indeed take place before me sitting in Manchester over two days, or straddling two days, on 27th February 2017.  The mother attended the first day of the hearing but did not in fact turn up for the second day.  The father personally did not attend at all.

In order to try to meet that concern I expressly provided by paragraph&#160;17 of my own order of 28th February 2017 as follows:  </p>

He has already been to England at least twice since children went at the end of July.  Seems to me to be essential if there is to be any just resolution that both parents engage directly in the court room with the court.  There is currently no passport order in force against father.  He is free to come and go.  I make crystal clear that so far as I am concerned if he attends the next hearing and is not in contempt, he will be free to go.  Of course, if he were to have committed or commit any offence, a criminal court may prevent his leaving.  So far as this court is concerned, he will be freely enabled to leave at the end of the hearing provided he is not in contempt.  As I have said, there have been earlier breaches of earlier orders.  That is now in the past.  There has been no application to commit for contempt.  On the hearing of 13th September 2016 it must have been patent that father had been and was in contempt but she chose not to take any action in relation to it.  He is not at risk in respect of any contempts up to today.  Of course, I cannot bind myself in respect of any contempts committed after today."</p>

It is convenient first to quote from that part of the father's statement dated 27th April 2017, which deals with this topic, namely paragraph&#160;18.  It said:</p>

It is clear that the father frequently had difficulty in hearing what all or some of us were saying in the court room. Equally, all or some of us had considerable difficulty at times in hearing or clearly following what he was saying.  Indeed, I at one stage left the bench and, effectively, huddled close to the instrument with the three counsel in order that we would try all to hear what he was saying and enable him to hear what we were saying.  I mention that because of some observations I will later make with regard to my own unwillingness to hear formal oral evidence from the father by telephone link in this case.</p>

I stressed to him repeatedly that provided he was not in contempt of court subsequent to yesterday, and provided he did not commit any criminal offences while in England and Wales, he would be free to leave and return to Iraq at the end of any adjourned hearing.</p>

As I understand his answers during that part of the exchanges, the father was saying that provided I could sufficiently reassure him that he would be permitted to leave at the end of any adjourned hearing, he would indeed attend one.  I think it was clear to all present, and presumably also to the father, that my own fervent desire yesterday was to try and achieve the situation in which both parents were personally present in the court room, both in order to hear oral evidence from each of them on this issue of duress and any other relevant issues, and also to try to have constructive dialogue as to future arrangements for these boys generally.  It was my understanding at the end of the first period of exchanges that the father was agreeable to attending personally, although he made crystal clear from first to last that he would never agree to the children returning to England and Wales.</p>

In the ensuing discussion with counsel about the possibility of adjournment, Mr&#160;Rosenblatt told me that his, that is, Mr&#160;Rosenblatt's, understanding from his instructions generally was that in fact the father would not attend any hearing unless he had a prior assurance that there would not be any order for the children at any stage to return to England and Wales.  That, of course, was not an assurance that I could give.  It may very well be that there should be a requirement that the children return to England and Wales for a number of reasons, even if they do not return to live here permanently.  They should, of course, resume contact with their mother, their maternal family and, indeed, their half siblings, the twin daughters.  It is highly desirable that there be a face to face meeting between them and their guardian, Mr John Power of CAFCASS, who has so far only been able to speak to them by Skype or some similar audio visual method.</p>

In contrast to what he had said earlier, but consistent with what Mr&#160;Rosenblatt had correctly said, the father then made clear that he would not attend himself if there was any possibility that the boys might be required at any stage to attend in England and Wales.  Since I could not preclude that possibility, a stalemate was effectively reached, in which there is blanket refusal by the father personally to attend any hearing.  In those circumstances it seemed, obviously, that there was in fact no purpose or utility in a further adjournment and I proceeded to hear the evidence of the mother and consider the issue of duress.</p>

She has said, both in written form and again by her oral evidence yesterday afternoon, that before and after she commenced the proceedings on 18th August 2016 the father threatened her by telephone, or Viber, that if she proceeded with those proceedings he would remove both children from Iraq to some other undisclosed place whose whereabouts she would never learn and from which she would never, ever be able to recover them or, indeed, communicate with them again.  She said in particular that, after she obtained that order from Cobb&#160;J on 2nd&#160;September 2016, the father repeated that threat to her even as she was returning to Manchester by coach later that evening.  So it was that she made  the written statement of 3rd September 2016. </p>

I can see no reason why the court cannot, and in appropriate cases should not, set aside orders if they are tainted or obtained as a result of duress.  I stress, however, that it is a strong and exceptional matter for any court to set aside earlier orders on this ground, and it should only be done with the utmost circumspection and care.  That is particularly so in the field of family law, for it is endemic and almost inevitable in any aspect of family law, that one or other or both parties are acting under, and motivated by, pressures of one kind or another.  To say that one felt under pressure could never of itself justify subsequently setting aside some consent order. Much more is required than that.  As a minimum, as Mr Venables rightly said this morning, the pressure must be deliberately imposed by the other party and it must have the element of illegitimacy.</p>

I am further satisfied that threats of that kind are patently illegitimate, and there can be no conceivable legitimate or justifiable reason for making them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, and significantly in this case, these were threats which had a continuing coercive force, from which the mother could not achieve any safety or release.  The contrast is with a threat, for example, to the personal safety of the victim himself or herself.  In those circumstances, if the victim is able to seek refuge, for example with the police who may be relied upon to protect him or her, then the continuing coercive force may cease.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, there was nobody to whom the mother could turn who could protect her from the threat being carried out.  The recent history already demonstrated the powerlessness of this court here in England to protect her children out in Iraq.  There were the several breaches of court orders that I have been at pains to describe.  The father knew, and the mother equally knew, that if he were to take the children to some other undisclosed place, this court and the English authorities would be almost totally powerless to do anything about it.  </p>

He himself had managed to leave this country despite the protection that the mother thought she had gained by the making of the passport order and its continuation by Keehan&#160;J on 25th August 2016.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of course duress can only be in play if it was in fact operating upon the mind of the victim so as to destroy the victim's own free will.  On the evidence of this mother, I am totally satisfied that the threats were powerfully operating on her mind in the whole period before and throughout the hearing on 13th&#160;September 2016.  Indeed, the coercive effect of the threat was so strong that, despite repeated attempts by His Honour Judge Jordan, in passages I have quoted, to penetrate through to what was going on, the mother never wavered and never hinted at the truth.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr&#160;Rosenblatt submitted as his second point this morning that the fact that the mother did not buckle under questioning from His Honour Judge Jordan tends to undermine both (a) her credibility as to the fact of the threats, and (b) her credibility that she was acting under the coercion of the threats.  That, of course, could be one conclusion.  I, however, unhesitatingly draw the reverse conclusion, that the very fact that she did not "buckle" under the questioning from His Honour Judge Jordan serves to demonstrate just how coercive and powerful upon her these threats were.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am thus satisfied that when the mother asked His Honour Judge Jordan to dismiss her proceedings and consented to his doing so, her own free will had been over-borne by powerful threats in all the circumstances that I have described.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further effect of the duress was that His Honour Judge Jordan himself was misled as to the true facts.  The true facts were that the mother was only asking him to dismiss her application because of the threats; but so powerful were the threats that she was able to mislead His Honour Judge Jordan into believing that it was simply her own wish and free will that her proceedings be brought to an end.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, I am in no doubt that the result of the duress, and of the fact that he was misled in that way, was that His Honour Judge Jordan made an order which it is inconceivable that he would have made if he had known the true facts.  If His Honour Judge Jordan had managed to gain even a hint of what the mother says is the truth at the hearing on 13th&#160;September, it is inconceivable that he would at that hearing have simply dismissed all these proceedings.  I cannot speculate as to what precisely he might have done, but unquestionably he would have required further enquiry before bringing the proceedings to an end.  </p>

It is an order that would never have been made but for the duress, and an order which in the circumstances should never have been made.</p>

That has the effect that those proceedings revive and are immediately reinstated.  Those proceedings were commenced by the mother by her application on 18th August 2016 at a time when, as is accepted by Mr&#160;Rosenblatt, both these boys were still clearly habitually resident in England and Wales </p>
