I have had extremely helpful position statements filed with the court from Mr Powell, on behalf of Mr B.  Mrs B is representing herself and has been able to helpfully direct the court to extra information, and Miss Jaffar represents B on the instructions of the Parental Order reporter, JS, as B&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Guardian.  Also present are members of the wider family who are important to B, namely NS and FS, GN and HC and the maternal grandmother, QLFK.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">B was born following a surrogacy arrangement that was entered into in September 2009 between Mr and Mrs B and Mr and Mrs P.  This arrangement was entered into through the fertility clinic called Gynaecworld, based in Mumbai.  Both the applicants have filed statements which set out the difficult and emotional journey they have made to fulfil their wish to have a child.  They have undergone a number of procedures, including IVF, which were sadly unsuccessful and it is that which led to them to consider a surrogacy arrangement. The court has not only had the benefit of reading these statements, but also both Mr and Mrs B have given oral evidence.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">It is quite clear that following their decision to embark on a surrogacy arrangement they took enormous care in making the decision about which clinic they would use.  They made enquiries in a number of different jurisdictions to understand themselves about the type of clinics available and the framework in which they operated in.  In particular, Mrs B set out at paragraph 8 of her statement the steps they took and why they chose the clinic that they did.  She said:</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-style:italic">"After many emails and phone calls with the clinic, doctors and past patients, we decided to visit Mumbai and see for ourselves how the process worked."</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-style:italic">"It was extremely important for me to have first-hand experience of the surrogates living quarters and conditions. To meet and talk to surrogates in person at different stages of pregnancy.  To meet the care takers, nutritionists, cooks, drivers, teachers and cleaners that look after the women to see what they do with their days, what choice of educational program the clinic provides as part of their contract and what happens in the run up to the birth and after.  I wanted to try and understand the issues from everyone's point of view.  There's more to it than just the intended parents and the surrogate.  There are so many more people involved in a responsible surrogacy in India, it cannot be done under the radar and nor does it need to be.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"> A surrogacy agreement was signed in September 2009 and the relevant embryo transfer took place soon afterwards.  In relation to their meetings with the surrogate mother, Mrs P, they have given some details about this in their statements and their oral evidence.  It appears that at the time they signed the surrogacy arrangement, Mr and Mrs P had not signed their part of the surrogacy arrangement, they signed it afterwards.  They secured advice from a gentleman called PL, an advocate who practises in Mumbai, which is attached to their statements. He confirmed in his document dated 25 May 2010 that the agreement was signed by the parties in September 2009 was one that, according to him, had been executed by the parties with full consent. All the parties to the agreement were explained the rights, obligations and duty cast upon them and in his view the above mentioned documents were legally valid and subsisting documents.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">The applicants met the surrogate mother on two occasions.  The first occasion was soon after the birth of B.  Mrs B was able to gain access to where the surrogate mother was and, as she described in her evidence, she spent about 15 minutes with her where she was able to communicate with her how grateful she was for the part she had played in the pregnancy and birth. The following day Mr and Mrs B were able to have a shorter meeting with her where they were again able to express the same views.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">They are clear there was no indication at the time that they met Mrs P, albeit very soon after B's birth, that there was any suggestion she was under pressure or had not consented to this arrangement.  That view is supported by their wider knowledge and enquiries in relation to the way this clinic operated and also by the communications they had had with the clinic prior to B's birth, when there were photographs sent of the surrogate mother's pregnancy and other information in relation to the progress of the pregnancy.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in">The financial arrangements in accordance with the agreement are set out and summarised in the position statement filed on behalf of Mr B.  At paragraph 7 onwards a table sets out the details in relation to the payments made.  The headline figures in sterling is a total sum was paid to the clinic of &#163;21,764.  Within that there are a number of identified payments.  In particular, a compensation payment made to the surrogate and her husband of &#163;2,631 with an additional payment because B was born by way of caesarean section of &#163;328. The balance was retained by the clinic, a commercial surrogacy clinic operating lawfully within India and the majority of the payments made were taken up with medical and other expenses. There would no doubt have been an element of profit, as this was a commercial business.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.42in"> B was born in early 2010.  She was placed almost immediately in the care of Mr and Mrs B.  They had made extensive efforts prior to B's birth to make sure that the necessary immigration arrangements were in hand.  As a result B was granted a certificate of registration as a British citizen on 1 June 2010. The British passport was given to them very soon afterwards, on 4 June 2010. In mid-June 2010 they were able to return with her back to the family home in the South East of England, where they have remained living since.</p>

Mr B drafted the necessary consent documents they would want Mr P and Mrs P to sign, to provide their consent to this court making a Parental Order, and for it to be done in a way that this court could be satisfied they have freely, and with full understanding, consented to the making of a Parental Order which will, in effect, extinguish any parental rights they have in this jurisdiction.</p>

They are documents that make clear in referring back to the surrogacy agreement, that it has been explained to them that in spite of the position under Indian law, nevertheless, English law deems them to be the legal mother and/or father of B and that they, Mr and Mr B, wish to apply for a Parental Order in respect of the child and the effect of which, if granted, would be to irreversibly transfer their parenthood of B under English law to Mr and Mrs B.  They confirmed they have had the contents of the document explained to them in their native language of Hindi and have received independent legal advice in Hindi from an advocate, PL, in relation to the document and have had the consent document implications fully explained to them.  It concludes with them having been afforded time to consider and reflect on the consent, that they irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the granting of a Parental Order in respect of the child.</p>

Firstly, they had obtained some quotes in relation to the legal cost of being represented in such an application which in their written evidence they described as prohibitive.  They were given quotes of figures of &#163;70,000 or &#163;80,000 to be able to make such an application.  Secondly, they had concerns not knowing whether such an application would be successful or not. Mr B in his oral evidence was very clear that the uncertainty of not knowing whether the application would be successful or not raised a real fear with him in relation to any publicity that may arise from such an application not being successful, and even feared that B may be removed from their care.</p>

In July 2016 the clinic, who Mr and Mrs B had been in regular contact with since they issued their application, tried to locate where the surrogate mother and her husband were. They were given an address for her by email dated 1 July 2016.  It was an address in Nepal.  Following that they located an advocate lawyer in the area who would be able to assist with any issues of service.  Mr B&#8217;s solicitors were given the name of someone who could be contacted in the area and that person was confirmed and identified in August 2016 as Mr KU, an advocate, who could assist.</p>

Miss Jaffar submits, on behalf of B, the court can be satisfied in the circumstances of this case that the respondents have had notice of this application, as the court can not only be satisfied that the documents were sent and received,  the critical part notifying them of what they were was in Hindi.  She also submits the court should look at the wider context of the case where there has been continuing contact between the applicants and the clinic. The respondents retained some communication with the clinic, so the clinic were able to establish where they had gone to. There is no suggestion in the period since B's birth in May 2010 that the respondents have not been content with the arrangement that was entered into.  In addition, they attended the clinic in August 2010 to sign the necessary consents before the court, for them to be notarised and to receive legal advice about them.  For those reasons the court can be satisfied on the evidence that the documents sent by email on 16 September can only be the original documents that must have been received by Mr and Mrs P, and there has been, in the circumstances of this case, effective service.</p>

Those, in my judgment, are facts that can be taken into account. The court can take notice of the fact that in 2010 there had only been a very few surrogacy arrangements like this that had gone through the Parental Order application process and, consequently, there were very few reported cases that dealt with the circumstances in which the court would grant Parental Orders. The situation is very different now, there are a number of cases publicly available that set out the circumstances in which the court will make a Parental Order, it appears that once Mr B became aware of that he very promptly arranged and agreed with Mrs B the application they have made should be submitted.  So, even though they had knowledge they could issue the application in 2010, when looked at it in the context of the situation in 2010, the uncertainties there were in relation to the procedure, and any fears in relation to publicity, these considerations together with a lack of understanding as to the need of a Parental Order and the consequences if one was not obtained, I am satisfied the circumstances are clear the court should permit the application to proceed.</p>

It sets out the details of her observations made regarding B's circumstances, her analysis in relation to the criteria for the court to make a Parental Order and at paragraphs 27 through to 36 she sets out her assessment in relation to B's situation and whether her welfare needs will be met by the court making a Parental Order.</p>

I have no hesitation in concluding that B's lifelong welfare needs require this court to make a Parental Order, that order will extinguish the residual parental rights the respondent surrogate mother and her husband have.  Importantly, such an order will confer joint and equal legal parenthood and parental responsibility upon both the applicants and this will ensure that B's security and identity as a lifelong member of the applicants' family is secured in the best way possible.</span></p>
