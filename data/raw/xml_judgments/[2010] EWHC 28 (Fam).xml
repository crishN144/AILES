	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">Baby X   was born prematurely on the 19 December 2007.  Her mother is Ms A and her father is Mr B.  Her parents are unmarried and have separated.  Baby X was cared for by her mother until the 1 August 2008 when she was hospitalised at Hospital C with an apparent respiratory illness.  She appeared to be recovering in hospital when she experienced a cardio-respiratory crisis (referred to as the &#8216;collapse&#8217;) on the 7 August 2008 while in the care of her mother but on a hospital ward.   The consequence of the collapse is an extremely severe neurological impairment.  Baby X is likely to be severely disabled for the rest of her life and has a significantly shortened life expectancy.</p>

Baby X was taken to the Evelina Children&#8217;s Hospital at St Thomas&#8217;s in London under the authority of police protection and an emergency protection order was granted on the following day.  Baby X has thereafter been subject to the protection of interim care orders and such has been the nature and extent of her medical condition that the High Court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction has been exercised <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> in relation to the key issue of whether she should be resuscitated.</p>

In particular, she needs health professional supervision with her gastro-intestinal motility and bowel function, her lung function and the high risk of aspiration, the control of her epilepsy, the management of her tone and pain and her evolving gross developmental delay.  On more than one occasion, the court has been told and the parties know that her life has been in danger.  A declaration as to the lawfulness of the withdrawal of treatment has been made and subsequently revoked.  There is now an emergency treatment agreement in place.  </p>

The apnoea alarm attached to Baby X would have sounded after 10 seconds of interrupted breathing.  An alarm sounded for only a brief period before assistance was called and it is accordingly likely that mother interfered with the apnoea alarm.</p>

She denies interfering with the apnoea alarm.  As to the 1 August 2008 admission she says that that was an event precipitated by natural causes.  Adopting the opinion of Professor Morris, Consultant Pathologist, she says that the collapse on the 7 August 2008 was the consequence of a medical i.e. natural mechanism, the precise details of which are unknown, but that Baby X&#8217;s breathing became shallower and less effective, causing hypoxia, then bradycardia, gasping and finally apnoea i.e. this was sadly a natural and explicable if not an explained event.</p>

There were incidents of serious domestic violence perpetrated by Mr B in the presence of Baby X and pre pregnancy domestic violence which included father breaking mother&#8217;s nose in February 2008 and hitting mother in the face in May 2008 for which he received a conviction for actual bodily harm.  These matters will be relevant to the assessment of the parents and father&#8217;s concessions are a matter of record accepted by the court. </p>

In that circumstance it is necessary to comment upon the submissions the court heard about the difficulty which arises from an approach to the evidence that the mere happening of more than one incident, by the very recurrence of the events, i.e. the rarity of unexplained events recurring, is said to raise a powerful inference as to cause.  I do not propose to enter into the interesting and broader scientific debates which exist on this topic.  A judicial inference as to cause is no more or less an evidential assessment than a determination of likelihood or risk.  It has to be based on facts which can be found.  If there is no direct evidence of the primary fact, there have to be secondary facts from which an inference as to the primary fact can be drawn.</p>

In the first place the material available to the court is likely to be much more extensive than would be admitted in a criminal trial.  In the second place the standard of proof to be applied before reaching a conclusion adverse to the parent or carer is, as we have set out above, also different.  Given a similar background to that in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Cannings</span> a judge would be required to ask himself which of two possible explanations, human agency or unascertained natural cause, is the more probable.

There is uncontradicted paediatric and pathological evidence that Baby Y died a sudden death which is unexplained.  There is insufficient evidence to re-open an investigation into his death by this court.  That remains the agreed position of the parties after consideration of whether any facts capable of being found in relation to the collapse suffered by Baby X might lead to a proper judicial inference in respect of the cause of death of Baby Y.  Accordingly, the possible causes of Baby Y&#8217;s death have played no part in this court&#8217;s consideration of the cause of Baby X&#8217;s admission and collapse.</p>

The court does not of course know whether this is other than a layman&#8217;s superficial description of him but those assessing him in due course or seeking to help him with the consequences of what has occurred should bear in mind the seriousness of the effect the consequences have had upon him.  None of this excuses his anger and violence which is serious.</p>

It was at least surprising to find that Ms A was patently superficial, demonstrably economical with the truth and lost in a performance which I regret to have to say was worthy of a soap opera and which, I suspect, only she believed.   Her attitudes to others including the process of examination and cross examination demonstrated a careless and self justifying approach from a witness whose recollections were by and large unreliable and sometimes demonstrated a worrying emotional response to the allegations put to her and the circumstances which occurred, whatever their cause.

That supporting mother comes from those who provided the most clear and cogent medical evidence in relation to the 8 August 2008 collapse, including that which is agreed.  Dr Wilson concludes that Baby X&#8217;s admission on the 1 August 2008 was an instance of unexplained ALTE.  Professor Klein thought that RSV may have been responsible for the admission &#8220;taking into account the clinical signs and symptoms as revealed by the clinicians in the early hours of that morning and thereafter&#8230;&#8221;.  That is an opinion relied upon by mother in her evidence.

It was a collapse, albeit not as severe as that 6 days later.  As Dr Wilson reported in his written evidence, apnoeas and convulsions usually occur in infants of less than 6 months with the majority occurring in infants of less than 3 months.  This was also the position of Professor Klein who added that RSV is rare in the summer.  Dr Wilson commented in some detail about the lack of severity of the RSV symptoms which Baby X was subsequently identified to have.  Again it was Professor Klein who said that Baby X had some features associated with RSV infection but her presentation was much more severe than would have been suggested by the history.</p>

The significance of epistaxis is dependent on the weight to be given to research conclusions on the facts of the case.  There is accepted, published opinion to the effect that epistaxis is strongly associated with upper airways obstruction.  That does not of course mean that every nose bleed will likely be the consequence of a suspicious act.  Neither Professor Morris&#8217;s hypothesis nor any natural mechanism associated with a collapse accounts for its presence in this case.  So does it add anything?    Dr Wilson advised caution.  Unless the court accepts that mother has dissembled about her evidence on this point and I do not, then the existence of a blood stained nasal discharge (which is the evidence of the paramedics which I accept is most likely to be accurate on the point) is insufficiently indicative of an unnatural act to change the balance of medical opinion which I have described.</p>

In my judgement it is unlikely that she used one of the earlier opportunities to smother her child and then raise the alarm only on her third visit to the bedroom.  Had mother&#8217;s evidence about this evening been of the same poor quality as that relating to the 7 August 2008, a very different conclusion would have to have been seriously considered.

Any court beginning an enquiry of this kind would be well advised to start from the position that the event is unexplained and at the end of the enquiry may still be unexplained.  That reflects the experience of both the courts and clinicians that in some sudden infant death and ALTE cases, despite exhaustive investigation including, where relevant, at post mortem, no organism or medical mechanism is identified as the cause.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">Dealing with the specific hypothesis that bacterial toxaemia may be the cause of the collapse.  Professor Morris says that his specific hypothesis has not been excluded and that on all the facts it is one of two possibilities, the other being upper airways obstruction.  In his experience (which is primarily histo-pathological rather than as a clinical paediatrician) he fairly says that &#8220;it is not possible to say which of the two possibilities is more likely&#8221;.  There are two theoretical routes to collapse using Professor Morris&#8217;s hypothesis: sudden cardiac failure or gradual hypoxaemia due to falling respiratory rate leading to bradycardia and the subsequent collapse of both breathing and circulation.  Sudden cardiac failure can safely be excluded having regard to the fact that Baby X was found in asystole and with such high levels of CO<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span> in her blood.</p>

Reduced respiratory drive without any underlying medical condition leaves the mechanism unexplained.  Professor Morris postulates the action of transient bacterial toxins.  Despite this being only a hypothesis, as an alternative possible cause of the collapse it needs to be carefully considered even if by that consideration the court concludes, as it began, that the mechanism of collapse is unexplained.  </p>

Impedence monitors were used to detect breathing.  I accept the evidence of Dr Shinebourne that this would now be regarded as giving rise to the possibility of a methodological fault in that when the heart rate slows it gives a slight electrical charge which can prevent the apnoea alarm on the monitor.  Likewise, the timing of the recordings was set in such a way that the possibility of suffocation before recordings began may have been unintentionally ignored with the deduction that intentional airways obstruction was unlikely being open to question. </p>

The authors of the paper warn against its use to extrapolate the conclusions to other children rather than for the purpose of developing hypotheses. The local authority say that as a consequence the assumptions made by Professor Morris to develop his specific hypothesis should not be applied to Baby X and that in her case there is nothing to sustain the notion that transient bacterial toxins caused the initial hypoxaemia.  If they are right that must lead to the conclusion that the cause of the initial hypoxaemia is unknown and hence the best that Professor Morris can do is to say that the cause of the collapse is unknown.</p>

Her unusual colour variously described as blue, purple and grey, a difference which Dr Wilson advised and I accept is not important on the facts of this case, suggests to them that Baby X had suffered from the circulation of increasingly de-oxygenated blood over a significant period of time.

Dr Kanabar thought several minutes to reach that colour and at least 60 seconds to cool down.  Dr Shinebourne thought it would have taken longer than a minute or two and that the presentation was not consistent with 30 seconds to a minute.  He added that the blood gases as subsequently analysed could only be explained if breathing had stopped completely for 5 minutes.  Dr Wilson thought 5 to 10 minutes.  From his separate expert perspective, Dr Stoodley supported this evidence by opining that the length of the causative insult i.e. the cessation of oxygen delivery to the brain was likely to have been minutes rather than a brief event having regard to the hypoxic changes demonstrated in Baby X&#8217;s brain.</p>

Baby X took a whole bottle of milk at 4.00 am on the 7 August 2008, only a couple of hours before her collapse.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">If the court finds that it was working effectively and alarmed and also that the child&#8217;s condition was such that some minutes had passed between the commencement of the crisis and before medical assistance was obtained, then it follows that one of the possibilities is that the alarm sounded and was then disabled so that no-one heard or responded to it until later when it was re-activated.  Another possibility is that it was sounding and Ms F did not hear it until she awoke and Nurse L did not hear it until after she entered the room.  The final possibility is that Baby X suffered a progressive decline which did not trigger the alarm until the final apnoea.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">One conflict is as to whether the ward doors were open or closed.  The nursing staff are all clear that the doors were ajar &#8211; either one or both.  Others were surprised that they had not heard the apnoea alarm.  All mother can say is that the doors were closed at 4.00 am.  Ms F said that the doors would be closed to prevent undue noise.  Having listened to the witnesses carefully, I tend to the conclusion that one door was open at an angle and the other was closed.  That was the evidence of Nurse K which I accept.  That meant that there would be some obstruction to audibility but not much.  Nurse L heard the apnoea alarm.  She was the most proximate person on duty and it is not surprising she was acute as to her realisation and subsequent recollection.  Ms F was woken by the alarm and then heard mother call out and the staff start to come in.</p>

Nurse L heard the apnoea alarm before the nurse call was heard by others as did Ms F.  I prefer the evidence of the nursing staff to mother and have come to the conclusion that the apnoea alarm had been activated for only seconds before Nurse L heard it.</p>

Even if mother&#8217;s evidence had otherwise been reliable, that at least casts doubt on mother&#8217;s assertions that she cancelled the alarm immediately or that she had picked up Baby X (which would have had the effect of cancelling the alarm).  In any event, mother did not tell the police that she had switched off the alarm, she apparently only told her own father.  Had she done this the red light would not have remained flashing: as observed by Nurse M.  One possibility is that mother told her father the truth but that she was recounting to him the fact that she had cancelled the alarm some minutes before she summoned assistance, the other is that her evidence on the point is wholly unreliable.</p>

She sought to suggest that she might not have heard it because of the i-pod music.  I do not think it likely that this mother would have put herself in a position where she could not hear her own child.  I note that to the police she said she had even been able to hear the girl in the bay visiting the bathroom.  I regret to have to find that her explanation in oral evidence, whether it departs from the medical hypothesis or not, was merely a last desperate attempt by mother to explain herself.  I reject it. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">Having regard to the extent to which I have rejected the evidence given by mother, there has to be a purpose to her switching off the apnoea machine and then, as I find she did, switching it back on some minutes later at a time which is coincident with the dramatic decline in her child&#8217;s condition.  It is a reasonable inference in all the circumstances that mother caused the cardio-respiratory arrest which followed and switched off the machine to avoid detection while she was doing it.  That is consistent with the most likely medical explanation i.e. intentional upper airways obstruction.  There are no circumstances advanced of accidental asphyxiation and I have concluded in all the circumstances that the most likely mechanism consistent with the medical and factual evidence is that mother intended to and did smother her own child.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.75in">In submission the question is asked, why would mother go to these lengths when at 4.00 in the morning she could have done what is alleged with so much less possibility of detection.  That argument assumes that mother intended to smother her child to death.  In my judgement, no such intention has been evinced by mother.  It can only be an hypothesis for subsequent assessment, but it must at least be a possibility that this deeply flawed mother wanted to prevent her child being discharged from hospital.  Whether that be for the attention and care it provided for Baby X or the attention it provided for herself or even for other reasons as yet unexplored must be a question for those who seek to assess the needs, risks and capabilities which remain to be decided.</p>

Mother concedes that she told a social worker that Baby X was not a planned child.  She was concerned that the pregnancy was so soon after the death of Baby Y and she wanted a baby for the right reasons not just as a replacement for Baby Y.  She communicated her worries about whether she should continue with the pregnancy.  In that context mother spoke about her confused feelings for Baby X.  She was grieving for the death of Baby Y.  She also said that she felt low when she wanted to feel happy.  The balance of reported information makes it highly likely that she told more than one person that she felt differently about Baby X in the sense that something was missing and she did not feel as close to her as she would have wanted to.</p>

I accept that Ms G had a tendency to take over and having heard Ms A&#8217;s mother in evidence I can easily imagine that that situation would have been the same in the grandparental home.  What is objectively correct is that Baby X was regularly cared for by her grandparents and Ms G every week to the extent of 2 or 3 evenings and nights.  Furthermore, for some of the time Baby X was cared for by her grandparents and once by Ms G while in hospital.  In both respects the care of Baby X by others was of an extent that I do not accept to be normal.</p>
