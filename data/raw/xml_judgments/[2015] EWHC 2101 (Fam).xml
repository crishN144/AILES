By that application, the wife seeks an order for the sale of a property in West London which is held in the parties joint names and for the equal division of the proceeds.  Although the parties are divorced (following divorce proceedings in France) I will refer to them for convenience as &#8220;the husband&#8221; and &#8220;the wife&#8221;.  I will call the subject property &#8220;the London house&#8221;.</p>

	      <p style="text-indent:0.5in">The husband has been represented by Counsel Mr Horton and the wife by Mr Amos QC with Ms Younis.  Each has put in a main Skeleton Argument together with a supplemental Skeleton Argument and I have heard their respective oral submissions.  I have read a lever arch file or more of documents.  The case has been strenuously argued.  The husband asserts (for reasons I will come to) that the wife is &#8216;forum shopping&#8217; in this jurisdiction.  The wife asserts that he is &#8216;filibustering&#8217; so as to put off any decision about the London house by insisting that its future should be determined in Poland.  Many points have been argued, all of which I have taken into account; but I do not propose to comment on them all, merely those which are most important in reaching a determination.</p>

There was an exchange of letters between him and the husband&#8217;s solicitors, to which I will come in part F.  It is said by the husband to amount to an agreement to prorogue any proceedings in relation to the London house to the Polish court for determination.  In February 2014, the husband paid the then outstanding part, some 173,000 euros, of the 250,000 euros &#8216;prestation compensatoire&#8217;.</p>

Mr Horton says that the wife bears it; Mr Amos says that the husband bears it.  He (Mr Amos) submits that there is sufficiently strong evidence that the husband was domiciled in England up to 2012 that it is incumbent on him (the husband) to satisfy the court of a change in that domicile.  Mr Horton accepts that, if there were a sufficiently recent status quo of domicile here, then it would indeed be for the husband to demonstrate a change.  He (Mr Horton) maintains however (a) that there is no sufficient evidence of any such a status quo and (b) that such evidence as there might be is too old to mean that any burden falls on the husband.  Wherever the burden lies, as to which I state my conclusion below, the standard is the balance of probabilities.</p>

	      <p>Mr Amos maintains that this Article clearly applies in respect of the wife&#8217;s application, by which she seeks an order for the sale of the London house.  He asserts the good sense of this by reference to the advantages of ready access to documents and ease of enforcement.  Mr Horton submits that Article 22 does not apply, because the object of the wife&#8217;s application is not rights in rem, but rather rights in personam.  He relies on <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Webb &#8211;v- Webb</span> 1994 QB 696, a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Communities (CJEC), which he submits is indistinguishable from this case.  In that case, a flat in France had been purchased in the name of an adult son with his father&#8217;s money.  Much later, the father sued the son in England for (a) a Declaration that the son held the flat beneficially for him, the father, and (b) an order requiring the son to vest the title in him, the father.  The son challenged the jurisdiction of the English court.  He maintained that the predecessor of Article 22 applied, since the father&#8217;s claim had as its object rights in rem and that therefore only the French court as the &#8216;lex situs&#8217; had jurisdiction.  The CJEC rejected that argument holding that Article 22 did not apply, since the father&#8217;s application had as its object rights in personam.  Therefore the decision of the Chancery Division of the High Court in England (<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Webb v Webb</span> 1991 1WLR 1410) had been correct in assuming jurisdiction over the father&#8217;s application.  </p>

There, an English husband and wife had moved to live in France leaving two flats in London.  When the husband petitioned for divorce in France, the wife responded by petitioning for divorce in England; but those proceedings were stayed.  She thereupon brought proceedings in England under TOLATA in which she sought a declaration that she was an equal owner in equity of the flats in London.  The Court of Appeal stayed those proceedings too on the basis that they were not based on rights in rem, but on rights in personam, and that there was nothing in dispute requiring any &#8216;on the spot&#8217; investigations.  The wife&#8217;s TOLATA application was held to be &#8220;&#8230; plainly strategic and plainly superfluous to the well established French ancillary relief proceedings&#8221;.  </p>

Here, by contrast, the existence (or not) of a trust is not in dispute.  The wife already has proprietary rights in the London house as co-owner.  What she is seeking to do is to enforce and give effect to those rights.  It is fair comment that the order which she seeks would be as against the husband personally, requiring him to join with her in selling the property.  To that extent it would be an in personam order; but the right which would lead to such an order is a right of ownership in the property &#8216;available against the whole world&#8217;.  </p>

	      <p style="text-indent:0.5in">Based on <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Prazic</span>, however, Mr Horton submits that it does not matter whether the immovable property concerned is held in joint names, or is in the name of one of the parties only.  I do not accept that.  I acknowledge that Thorpe LJ said at the outset of his Judgment in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Prazic</span> &#8220;&#8230;. Seemingly during the marriage the parties, <span style="font-style:italic">or one of them</span>, acquired two flats in Notting Hill&#8221; [Emphasis added].  But other parts of the Judgment make it sufficiently clear that the flats were in the husband&#8217;s sole name.  At paragraph 13 he, Thorpe LJ, said that what was really in issue was &#8220;&#8230; whether the dealings between the parties result in the creation of an equitable interest [in the wife&#8217;s favour]&#8221;.  Further, at paragraph 23, he cited from the trial judge, who had referred to the wife&#8217;s claim as &#8220;&#8230; a claim to a beneficial interest arising under a constructive trust &#8230;.&#8221;, implying that the wife was not a joint owner of the flats.  Even if that is wrong, there is nothing in the judgment in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Prazic</span> to suggest that the wife was seeking an order for sale.  Paragraph 2 of the Judgment makes clear that what she was seeking was a declaration against the husband that she was an equal owner of the flats in equity.  By party of reasoning with <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Webb v Webb</span>, that would be a claim in personam.  So the court was able to stay Mrs Prazic&#8217;s TOLATA application.  It would have been unable to do so on the basis of Article 22 if the object of the application had been rights in rem, because in that event the English court&#8217;s jurisdiction as the lex situs would have been exclusive (although it would still have been possible to do so on the ground that the TOLATA application was an abuse, given the extant French financial proceedings in that case).  </p>

	      <p>Mr Amos embraced this Article when I said during argument that I could not at first blush see why it should not apply here.  Mr Horton maintains that it does not apply because in his submission the court is concerned here with a resulting or constructive trust, unsupported by any evidence in writing.  I do not follow that argument.  When the London house was purchased in 1990, it was placed into the parties&#8217; joint names.  At that time, they therefore held it on the statutory trusts imposed by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Law of Property Act 1925</ref>, including the statutory Trust for Sale.  Since the date when TOLATA came into force in 1996, jointly-owned real property is held on a Trust of Land; but still by way of statutory imposition.  This seems to me to fulfil that part of Article 5(6) which refers to &#8216;a trust created by the operation of a statute&#8217;.  The parties are the trustees and beneficiaries of that trust.  Such trust cannot sensibly be regarded as being domiciled anywhere other than in this jurisdiction, since the London house is situate here and the parties were living here at the time of its purchase, when the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Law of Property Act 1925</ref> imposed a Trust for Sale.  It follows to my mind that the ingredients of Article 5(6) are made out.  I therefore hold that the English court has jurisdiction under Article 5(6) as being the Member State in which the trust relating to the London house is domiciled.</p>

	      <p>In saying that the parties here have progrogued jurisdiction to Poland, Mr Horton relies on an exchange of correspondence between Mr W (the wife&#8217;s debt collector) and the husband&#8217;s solicitors.  Mr W was seeking to get in the debt of &#8364;250,000 owed by the husband to the wife pursuant to the French Supreme Court&#8217;s order dated 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2013 (above).  On 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2013, he wrote to the husband&#8217;s solicitors (copied to the wife&#8217;s solicitors) calculating the amount still owed as being &#8364;173,000 including interest and costs of enforcement.  The letter contains a paragraph:</p>

	      <p style="text-indent:0.5in">There are a number of issues as to the proper construction of these exchanges.  I propose to take them shortly and deal with only three of them, since I have in any event held that Article 22 gives the English court exclusive jurisdiction which cannot be varied by agreement.  First, there is an issue as to whether Mr W has been shown to have had authority to bind the wife to a prorogation of any proceedings relating to the London house.  There is no evidence of any actual authority given by the wife to Mr W and so the question is as to whether he had any implied or ostensible/apparent authority?  Mr Horton says Yes; Mr Amos says No.  The burden here rests on Mr Horton.  There is no evidence of any representation made by the wife to the husband or his solicitors that Mr W was authorised to enter into a prorogation agreement which would be binding on her: see per Diplock LJ in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Freeman and Lockyer -v- Buckhurst Park Properties Ltd. (Mangal) Ltd</span> 1964 2QB 480.  Nor in my view would a debt collector have implied or apparent authority to enter into an agreement collateral to the relevant debt involving potentially far-reaching legal consequences.  This is not the same as a debt collector&#8217;s accepting (as in Mr Horton&#8217;s example) a car in partial lieu of cash.  I am fortified in this by the husband&#8217;s solicitors&#8217; own concerns about Mr W&#8217;s &#8216;authority to conclude the matter&#8217; referred to in their above letter of 27 January 2014.  Second and very briefly, I am unclear as to what &#8216;consideration&#8217; the husband gave in return for any such agreement to prorogue the matters to Poland, as he only in fact paid the sum (plus interest) which he had been ordered to pay by the French court.  </p>

	      <p style="text-indent:0.5in">The two Polish experts have produced a joint report and have answered questions from both sides.  They say &#8220;&#8230; [the London house] &#8230;is not subject to the proceedings in respect of the division of the joint estate and dissolution of co-ownership before the Polish court&#8221;.  They continue that, whilst the Polish court can rule that there be unequal (or equal) shares of the entirety of the joint estate, it is &#8220;&#8230;.not admissible to apply this rule as the legal basis for ascertainment of the spouses&#8217; unequal shares only in certain parts of this joint estate&#8221;.  Therefore, &#8220;&#8230; the consequences of the decision resolving the case are going to affect the ownership of the property situated in Poland and moveable items.  However, <span style="font-style:italic">they are not going to extend to the ownership of the property situated in London</span> (and in France) since this falls outside the scope of the application for the division of joint estate.  As a result, the Polish court is <span style="font-style:italic">not going to adjudicate in respect of the division of co-ownership of the property located in London eg by ordering its auction sale</span>&#8221;.  [Emphasis added].  This is stated to be notwithstanding that the ability of the Polish court to fix the shares (equal or unequal) of the entire joint estate includes the London house.  In other words, as it seems to me, the Polish court will not look at individual assets within the joint estate, although it will look at the joint estate in the round, including the London house.  Last the experts&#8217; report states that &#8220;&#8230;at the date of initiation of the proceedings before the London court, the case was not yet pending (lis pendens) before the Polish court, as the condition of pendency is contingent on the service on the other party to the proceedings [the wife]&#8221;.</p>

		      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;As far as the first hearing in the proceedings for the division of joint estate in respect of the real property located in London, initiated by the [wife&#8217;s TOLATA] application of 25 April 2014 is concerned, this was held on 9 June 2014 [by DJ Aikens] which date also preceded the day when the dispute in the case VI 657/14 [in Poland] became pending.

	      <p>The Polish court went on to refer to the proceedings in respectively London and France, saying &#8220;&#8230;none of these proceedings [in England and France] extend to the parties&#8217; moveable belongings and [or] the apartment located in Poland.  At the same time, these cases are <span style="font-style:italic">already pending</span> in Great Britain and France, as opposed to the present case [the husband&#8217;s Polish application] in which a copy of the application has not yet been served &#8230;. Bearing in mind the above circumstances, the challenged decision [the Polish district court&#8217;s decision dated 7 July 2014 to strike out the husband&#8217;s application] had to be annulled in order to enable continuation of the [husband&#8217;s] proceedings for partial division of the inheritance in respect of the property located in [Poland] and moveable belongings of the parties, as well as their property rights, <span style="font-style:italic">with the exception of any rights to the real properties situated respectively in [France] and London</span>&#8221;.  [Emphasis added].  That decision was picked up in the subsequent order of the Polish district court dated 19 February 2015 where it ordered the husband&#8217;s attorney &#8220;&#8230;to correct formal defects of the application by its unambiguous clarification that is to indicate precisely the current content of the application &#8230;. ie what all the assets are (properties in Poland and moveable items of the parties as well as their estate related rights <span style="font-style:italic">not covered by any proceedings held before appropriate authorities in France or in England</span>) which are to be subject to division by this court&#8221; [emphasis added].</p>

	      <p style="text-indent:0.5in">Two things thus emerge from the Polish proceedings and the Polish expert evidence.  The first is that, in the view of Polish law, the English court was first seized by way of the issue of the wife&#8217;s TOLATA application.  That is because, although it was not issued until 25 April 2014, the husband&#8217;s Polish application of 1 July 2013 (above) had not been served on the wife by that time.  This is borne out by a letter of protest by the wife&#8217;s solicitors dated 18 August 2014 and by the wife&#8217;s statement of August 2014 in these proceedings averring (although giving a wrong date) that she and her solicitors had not yet been served with the husband&#8217;s application.  </p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_46">
	    <num>46.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-indent:0.5in">The second thing to emerge from the Polish proceedings is that the Polish court has expressly stated that it is not dealing with the London house (nor the parties&#8217; property in France).  Mr Horton says that the husband could add an application to the Polish proceedings to include the London house being dealt with specifically and as an independent item of property.  He maintains further that, having made a division of the totality of the joint estate, the Polish court could then move on to making orders for sale, or ordering transfers with balancing payments and so on.  As Mr Amos submits however, that is not what the experts&#8217; report says and, although I raised the possibility of further questions of the experts to support (or not) Mr Horton&#8217;s submission and clarify the position, that was not taken up.</p>
	    </content>

	  <paragraph eId="para_47">
	    <num>47.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-indent:0.5in">Accordingly there are not &#8216;related actions&#8217; pending in the two different jurisdictions, because the English court would deal with the London house, whereas on the evidence the Polish court would not.  Even if there were proceedings in Poland relating to the London property, they would not necessarily produce an irreconcilable judgment because the Polish court would look at the entirety of the estate in the round; whereas the English court would deal specifically and solely with the London house.  As Mr Amos said, any decision of the Polish court could be made to reconcile with the outcome of the English proceedings, namely by taking account of the amount which the wife had already been held entitled to in this jurisdiction.  Last but not least, I repeat the conclusion of the Polish court about non-pendency in Poland and the unchallenged assertion of the wife that when she issued her TOLATA application she had not been served with the husband&#8217;s Polish proceedings.  I therefore hold that the English court is the court first seised and that no discretion arises to stay the TOLATA proceedings in favour of any proceedings in Poland.  For these several reasons Article 28 does not apply.  If I had a discretion to stay, I would not exercise it in favour of a jurisdiction which has made it clear that the question of the London house is not an issue with which it regards itself as dealing.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-indent:0.5in">Having worked through the ways in which the English court would have jurisdiction over the London house, I conclude that it does have such jurisdiction.  This is (a) because the property is situated here and the wife&#8217;s claims are based on her rights in rem over it and (b) because the trust of land relating to it is domiciled here and both parties are trustees/beneficiaries thereof.  I am not persuaded that there was any agreement binding on the wife to prorogue proceedings about the London house to Poland and, even if there had been, it would not affect the exclusivity of jurisdiction under Article 22.  Last, I find that there is no discretion to stay the TOLATA proceedings under Article 28.  So the husband&#8217;s application before me must be dismissed.  This is one of those cases where, in spite of the very obvious advantages of getting everything dealt with together, the parties as things stand will have to litigate in different jurisdictions.  I urge them strongly however to come to some pragmatic overall agreement about their assets, rather than continue paying out legal costs in three separate jurisdictions.</p>
