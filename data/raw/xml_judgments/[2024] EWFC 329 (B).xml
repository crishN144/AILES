A subsequent MHA assessment found the mother not to be detainable, but she agreed to an informal hospital admission.

This is not because she does not care for her daughter but because she is distracted and overwhelmed by her own personal issues and feelings of agitation, and this causes her to be unable to focus on the needs of a child in her care.

It is clear to me that the father has and will continue to provide S with a good level of physical care. The evidence before me indicates that the father is attuned to S and has a good understanding of her emotional needs I urge the father to take advantage of advice as S grows and develops. On the balance of probabilities, I find that he will do so and that therefore S's needs are likely to be met. There will be challenges of course. The father is dependent on local authority support and it is not clear that he will be able to remain in the United Kingdom. However, it has been set out that financial support will be available to the father both in the short and in the medium term. I cannot make any prediction about the outcome of the father's application to remain in the United Kingdom. I can take judicial note of the court&#8217;s experience that people who have the primary care of a child who has been the subject of proceedings are often able to remain in the United Kingdom even if that person&#8217;s immigration position has not been regularised. I also remind myself that S will not be able to be removed from the jurisdiction without the permission of this court. Therefore, taking a view in the medium to long term, I find that S&#8217;s needs will be met by her father and that she is likely to thrive in his care.</span></p>

This would be harmful to her. In my judgement the father's ability to meet S&#8217;s needs would be undermined if he attempted to do so in partnership with the mother.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:-0in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In my judgment this plan clearly meets S&#8217;s needs. She will be able to spend time with her mother but also needs to be protected from the mother&#8217;s inability at times to retain her focus on S and to refrain from volatile behaviour. I have reviewed the contact notes and agree with the guardian and Ms W that they do not indicate an improvement in the mother&#8217;s ability to care for S but are a continuation of the evidence from Z assessment unit and note the mother missed a number of sessions. I do not make a child arrangements order in relation to the mother spending time with S. The plan set out above should be noted in the recitals to the order but given it may change in the near future a defined order would not be appropriate.</span></p>
