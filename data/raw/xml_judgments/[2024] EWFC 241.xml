The issue between the parties has been the impact of the terms of the parties&#8217; Pre-nuptial Agreement (&#8216;PNA&#8217;), on the ownership of certain valuable chattels acquired during the parties&#8217; marriage, for all relevant purposes in the sole name of the wife, but purchased with funds drawn from joint accounts held by the parties. By the PNA, those joint accounts were to be treated as &#8216;Joint Property&#8217;.</span></p>

He was previously a banker, having worked for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and then Credit Suisse.  He left banking in 2018, he says in order to support her and to manage the renovations of the family home, 73-75 Avenue Road, London NW8 6JD (&#8216;Avenue Road&#8217;) which is a very valuable and substantial property in North London.  He then set up an investment partnership called </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">Loh-Gronager Partners Ltd in July 2021, which was funded very largely by the wife. His disclosure at the time of the parties&#8217; PNA in 2019 was that he had a net capital worth of &#163;650,000.</span></p>

They married on 12 October 2019, and separated on 10 May 2023, although the wife puts the true end of their relationship to the Autumn of 2022. Nothing however turns on this for the purposes of this application. The preliminary issue before me as indicated concerns valuable chattels purchased during the parties&#8217; marriage to furnish Avenue Road, and worth several millions of pounds. The chattels were acquired using funds held at the point of purchase in two accounts in the joint names of the parties. These joint accounts are held with Barclays Bank Plc., and carry account numbers ending 7263 and 9556 (the &#8216;Joint Accounts&#8217;). </span></p>

Clearly the issue will not impact on any needs based assessment, as the items will remain within the parties&#8217; resources. In fact, neither party is ultimately suggesting that the chattels in dispute can be classed as &#8216;Joint Property&#8217; under the PNA. Although Mr Glaser KC for the husband did initially assert this to be the case in response to a question from me, he later rowed back from that position. </span></p>

Thereafter Wei-Lyn acknowledges and agrees to keep the joint bank account topped up to a minimum of &#163;250,000 up until January 2022 when she will thereafter increase this to a minimum of &#163;500,000. The purpose of setting up this joint bank account is to cover all utility bills and general household expenses at the Matrimonial Home and also both parties&#8217; day to day living expenses. Both Wei-Lyn and Ardal acknowledge and accept that in the event of divorce, the joint bank account will be closed and the balance divided equally between them.</span></p>

If money paid in by the wife during the marriage had then been returned to the wife&#8217;s sole accounts without being used, it would not surely have been treated as having become equally the husband&#8217;s money. And if it had then been used to acquire a chattel, he would not properly have been in a position to claim a share in that item. Why should the position be different if the money moves from a joint account to the purchase of a chattel in the wife&#8217;s sole name without first being paid back into one of her accounts?

So, whilst money sitting in the joint account would continue to be treated as joint, once it left that account for a purpose other than that specified at paragraph 2.9, the fact that the money had spent time in that account would not necessarily be its only defining characteristic.

The husband acquired an interest in the joint account, because by the PNA it was Joint Property, but he did not make a financial contribution to it in the relevant period.</span></p>

The two provisions are clearly both separate and opposite in their effect. The PNA in both cases is clearly using the terms &#8216;contributions&#8217; or &#8216;financial contribution&#8217; to connote actual rather than deemed contributions, whether they are to be counted or ignored. The husband&#8217;s case would involve deeming an actual financial contribution by him into paragraph 22.4, by reason of the operation of paragraph 2.9, when in fact he has not made any such contribution.</span></p>

They simply never anticipated in 2019 that the joint accounts would be used administratively as I find later became the case. They intended that their respective actual financial contributions would be relevant for interests in any jointly acquired (but solely held) chattels, but not to their interests in &#8216;Joint Property&#8217;.</span></p>

They are not intended to enable one party to claim a 50% share in an asset which is not held by them or jointly, and to the acquisition of which they have made no actual financial contribution. </span></p>

In those circumstances the husband is not entitled under the provisions of the PNA to any interest in their value, and the items fall to be treated as part of the wife&#8217;s separate property. </span></p>
