She had committed to Mr Y, had moved in with him, but did not yet know that this was going to work out in the long-term.  She wished to have the insurance of maintaining [her house] in case the relationship did not work out, and for the husband to continue to be the one to ensure that she would be in a position to maintain that property. </span></p>

The impression I got was that she has not felt the need to get on top of the figures, because she has looked to the husband or Mr Y to help her with any shortfall between what she is spending and what she has available to her.  She has not provided a clear picture of her incomings or her outgoings.  </span></p>

She complained that there were difficulties in him paying for all the clubs and activities, but when questioned, her accusations turned out not to be well-founded.  For example, she said he paid for only one clarinet lesson, but when pressed said he paid for just one term of lessons.  She was pressed again and conceded that in fact he had paid for the lessons over a whole year.  She said that the husband had not paid all the school fees, but further investigation revealed that the only fees unpaid related to her decision to switch schools  suddenly without giving the requisite notice.  </span></p>

She accepts of course that her claim for spousal maintenance has fallen away, but the schedule which has now been prepared relating to child maintenance only has been substantially increased compared to those prepared on her behalf in February 2021 and in September 2021.  She acknowledged that the items on the list were not all things that she was currently paying for, but were her assessment of the children&#8217;s needs going forward.  She was vague as to the costs of anything on the list, and accepted that her husband pays for all costs relating to running the household, had paid for the holidays she and the girls had taken with him over the past year, that she drove his cars, and that the school fees, extra-curricular activities in and out of school, including horse-riding were paid by her husband directly.</span></p>

I accept Mr Tatton-Bennett&#8217;s submission that this is effectively seeking continued spousal maintenance by the back door.  Mr Finch&#8217;s submissions ignore the fact that these parties were divorced nearly a decade ago, and came to terms in respect of financial arrangements based on the circumstances that existed at that time.  The wife received sufficient sums from the marriage to enable her to rehouse, and then to provide for herself and for her children.  The tapering of the maintenance payments was in recognition that she received the lion&#8217;s share of the equity the parties had in the former matrimonial home, and that she had an earning capacity that she would be able to utilise once the children were older.  After a very short marriage she received a net income of &#163;72,000 a year for six years, then dropping down to &#163;60,000 in 2020.  </span></p>

Firstly, it is questionable whether there is any real disparity.  If anything, the wife now enjoys a significantly more luxurious lifestyle than the husband and his wife.  She does not work whereas they are both working and incurring childcare costs.  Secondly, this was an exceptionally short marriage and there is no obligation upon the husband to continue to account to her for any share of his income or for there to be parity.  If either of them were to inherit large sums of money or win the lottery they would not be required to account to the other for a share, and nor do they need to in the event of an upturn in income. </span></p>

The girls had bedrooms decorated for them, two dogs bought by Mr Y for the family, and teachers at school were told this was a permanent move.  Mr Y was supporting the wife financially and was fully involved in the children&#8217;s lives as a step-father, joining in family activities, meeting their father at handovers.

However, at the same time, a person should not be so fearful of the loss of the financial security intended to be provided for them by a spousal maintenance payment, that they feel restricted in taking steps to enter into a relationship or allow it to progress in stages towards a greater commitment.  There must be a period of time before a cohabiting relationship has become settled and permanent where it remains justified for spousal maintenance to continue.</p>

However, that this result has been reached, against the tide of obfuscation and disregard of court orders by the wife, supports my view that had she conducted this litigation as she should have done then a similar position would have been reached as a result of reasonable negotiation, with the consequent saving of time and costs.</p>

I take into account that the husband would have incurred costs in any event, that the maintenance has in the end been shifted upwards, and that he was not successful on the issue of back payment.</p>
