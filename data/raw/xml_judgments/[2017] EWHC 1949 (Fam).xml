The Judge has given permission for this anonymised version of the judgment (and any of the facts and matters contained in it) to be published on condition always that the names and the addresses of the parties and the children must not be published.  For the avoidance of doubt, the strict prohibition on publishing the names and addresses of the parties and the children will continue to apply where that information has been obtained by using the contents of this judgment to discover information already in the public domain. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that these conditions are strictly complied with.  Failure to do so will be a contempt of court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 27 September 2016, District Judge Molineaux granted care orders in respect of W, aged 15, C, aged 14, N, aged 9 and T, aged 3.  T has a disability.  The District Judge also granted placement orders in respect of N and T.  The mother and the father of the children do not accept the validity of the District Judge&#8217;s decision.  </p>

That online campaign has taken the form of a petition addressed to the United Kingdom Parliament and the Prime Minister on the Change.org website.  The mother has also published some information on her Facebook page concerning the proceedings in respect of the children.  The material on the Change.org website was brought to the attention of the local authority by the foster carers for N and T on 23 May 2017.  </p>

The local authority is represented by Ms Sarah Duxbury of counsel. The parents represent themselves before the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 23 May 2017, this matter came before the court with the parents having been given short, informal notice of the application.  I declined to deal with the matter without proper notice to the parents.  In the circumstances, I abridged time for service and listed the matter for a hearing on notice.  At a hearing on the 25 May 2017 the parents appeared in person and had constructive discussions with Ms Duxbury prior to the matter coming before me.  As a result of those discussions, the parents agreed to submit to an order prohibiting them from publishing information about the care proceedings and the placement proceedings on any social media sites, including Facebook.  The parents further agreed to remove the material that had been published on Facebook and to remove the pictures, names and ages of the children that had been published on the main page of the petition on the Change.org website.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents were not, however, prepared to remove the petition on Change.org in its entirety as they submitted they had a right to protest about decision of the court and to petition Parliament and the Prime Minister in respect of their grievances.  That remains their position today.  For its part, the local authority declined to discontinue its application for injunctive relief compelling the parents to take down the petition in its entirety in circumstances where, whilst the parents had agreed to remove the pictures, names and ages of the children from the petition, the local authority contended that friends and acquaintances of the parents had identified, and may yet identify the children when responding to that petition.  The local authority contended that this constituted a disproportionate interference with the Art 8 right to respect for private life of the children.  That remains its position today.  In the circumstances, I adjourned the matter for final hearing on the question of whether the parents should be compelled to remove their petition from the Internet in its entirety and have heard submissions on that question at this hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It will be apparent that the local authority seeks injunctive relief only against the parents in this matter. There has been no suggestion that injunctive relief is sought against Change.org (and accordingly no notice of these proceedings has been given to that company) nor has there has a wider application for a <span style="font-style:italic">contra mundum</span> injunction. Within this context, and before turning to the substantive issue, I must make some observations about an unfortunate course of conduct by the local authority following the granting of the order by consent on 25 May 2017.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the hearing on 25 May 2017, the mother contacted the court to alert it to the fact that the local authority was writing to members of her family in a manner that suggested that those family members were bound by the order of 25 May 2017 and prohibited from adding their names and comments to the Change.org petition.   Having seen a copy of the letter being circulated by the local authority, I was satisfied that it does indeed read in that way and I notified the local authority through my Clerk that I would require an explanation. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority now accepts that the letter it sent to family members does, wrongly, intimate that the order of 25 May 2017 prohibited family members from responding to the petition. Whilst the letter in question was written and sent by the allocated social worker, it would be wrong to criticise her.  The social worker, as one would expect, sent the letter to the legal department of the local authority for checking before sending it out and the legal department returned the letter to the social worker un-amended for dissemination.  The actions of this local authority legal department in permitting a letter in the terms drafted by the social worker to be sent are strongly to be deprecated.  It is a matter of very grave concern that a local authority would seek to pass off an order of this court as something that it is not.  There must be no repeat of this.</p>

It is directed to the United Kingdom Parliament and to the Prime Minister.  In its original form, the explanatory narrative for the petition set out details of the final hearing before the District Judge, details of the orders granted by the court, the names, ages and disabilities of the children.  The explanatory narrative also alleged that the social worker &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">lied under oath</span>&#8221; and that the case was heard &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">without evidence</span>&#8221; of emotional harm or neglect. Whilst, as I have already noted, there is no indication in the papers before me that the decision of the District Judge has been the subject of an appeal, but that certain information provided by the mother since the hearing suggests an appeal is at least contemplated, the explanatory narrative on the petition states that the mother is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">applying to appeal to a higher court</span>&#8221; to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">put evidence before a judge to prove the social worker has lied under oath</span>&#8221;.

On 8 June 2017, the photographs of N and T had been replaced with a photograph of all four children with their faces partially obscured.  Ms Duxbury has confirmed that the parents have now complied fully with the consent order of 25 May 2017 with respect to the pictures, names and ages of the children that had been published on the main page of the petition on the Change.org website.  As I have noted, friends and acquaintances of the parents have, on a limited number of occasions, identified the children by their forenames when responding to the petition and those posts remain.

He said that he is not a man who often stands up for himself (an assertion that I must confess I find hard to believe) but on this issue, he felt he had to.

It is not a mechanical exercise to be decided upon the basis of rival generalities. An intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary before the ultimate balancing test in terms of proportionality is carried out.

Whilst the activity in question may be argued to comprise an element of assembling with others online to discuss and promote ideas collectively, the primary aim of the activity remains protest by way of the expression of personal opinions to secure redress.  Within this context, and having regard to their respective nature and scope, I am satisfied that the right most relevant to the facts is the Art 10 right to freedom of expression rather than the Art 11 right to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association.

Inevitably, therefore, any order which prevents or restricts publication of a party&#8217;s name or other information which may enable him to be identified involves a derogation from the principle of open justice and the right to freedom of expression.  Whenever the court is asked to make an order of that kind, therefore, it is necessary to consider carefully whether a derogation of any kind is strictly necessary, and if so what is the minimum required for that purpose.  The approach is the same whether viewed through the lens of the common law or that of the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular articles 6, 8 and 10&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, it is again important to recall that what the parents seek to do in compiling their online petition is to obtain redress from Parliament or the Government or both regarding a personal grievance by way of petition.  Within this context (and independent of the question of the significance of the prohibition in the Bill of Rights on &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">commitments and prosecutions</span>&#8221; with respect to petitions seeking redress) the fact that the right of the citizen to petition Parliament or the Government in respect of a personal grievance has been, and remains a fundamental constitutional principle further illuminates the importance for the parents of the Art 10 right to freedom of expression in this case.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Scott</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1913] AC 417" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1913">[1913] AC 417</ref>, Lord Shaw of Dunfermline, in observations which deal with both the importance of open justice and, by reference to Hallam, the constitutional right of the citizen to petition Parliament or the Government with respect to a personal grievance, stated as follows:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;It is needless to quote authority on this topic from legal, philosophical, or historical writers. It moves Bentham over and over again. &#8220;In the darkness of secrecy, sinister interest and evil in every shape have full swing. Only in proportion as publicity has place can any of the checks applicable to judicial injustice operate. Where there is no publicity there is no justice&#8221;. &#8220;Publicity is the very soul of justice. It is the keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guards against improbity. It keeps the judge himself while trying under trial&#8221;. &#8220;The security of securities is publicity&#8221;. But amongst historians the grave and enlightened verdict of Hallam, in which he ranks the publicity of judicial proceedings even higher than the rights of Parliament as a guarantee of public security, is not likely to be forgotten: &#8220;Civil liberty in this kingdom has two direct guarantees; the open administration of justice according to known laws truly interpreted, and fair constructions of evidence; and the right of Parliament, without let or interruption, to inquire into, and obtain redress of, public grievances. Of these, the first is by far the most indispensable; nor can the subjects of any State be reckoned to enjoy a real freedom, where this condition is not found both in its judicial institutions and in their constant exercise.&#8221; I myself should be very slow indeed (I shall speak of the exceptions hereafter) to throw any doubt upon this topic. The right of the citizen and the working of the Constitution in the sense which I have described have upon the whole since the fall of the Stuart dynasty received from the judiciary &#8211; and they appear to me still to demand of it &#8211; a constant and most watchful respect. There is no greater danger of usurpation than that which proceeds little by little, under cover of rules of procedure, and at the instance of judges themselves. I must say frankly that I think these encroachments have taken place by way of judicial procedure in such a way as, insensibly at first, but now culminating in this decision most sensibly, to impair the rights, safety, and freedom of the citizen and the open administration of the law.&#8221;</p>

The information comprising the petition consists, essentially, of (a) a statement that the children were the subject of care and placement proceedings, (b) a statement that the parents do not agree with the decision of the court, (c) a statement that they do not think the proceedings were fair, nor the decision evidence based, (d) a statement that they are seeking to try and overturn the decision and (e) statements by a number of people expressing agreement with them, a small number of which statements refer to the children by their forenames notwithstanding the parents agreement to remove the children&#8217;s names from the front page of the petition.   The information in the petition contains no details of the evidence and submissions the court heard during proceedings, no details of the significant harm the court found the children to have suffered and no details of the children&#8217;s current circumstances, save that two of the children are the subject of a plan for adoption.  The mother is referred to by both her forename and surname as the instigator of the petition and, thus, in circumstances where a limited number of responses to the petition mention the children using their forenames, the children are, in places, identifiable as having been the subject of proceedings (a situation that is not prohibited by the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 12</ref> (<span style="font-style:italic">A v Ward </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 FLR 1497" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 FLR 1497</ref>)).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning in detail to the contended for justifications for interfering with the Art 10 rights of the parents relied on by the local authority, Ms Duxbury essentially submits that it is a matter of common sense that if C and W see online that their mother does not accept the outcome of the proceedings nor the validity of the care orders, this will act to upset the two children and undermine the stability and security of their respective foster placements.  However, aside from this assumption, the local authority provides no specific evidence to support its contention that the presence of the petition, and its contents will cause emotional harm to C and W by means of causing them upset and potentially de-stabilising their respective foster placements.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst it is the case that W&#8217;s foster placement has recently broken down, and Ms Duxbury informs the court that the foster carers feel that the precipitating issue was a level of anger and frustration being generated in W resulting from conflicting information being received from his birth family, there is no evidence before the court demonstrating that the breakdown resulted from the petition on the Change.org website (as opposed to, for example, exchanges during contact).  Further, the assumption inherent in Ms Duxbury&#8217;s submission itself must be interrogated by reference to the nature of the information contained in the petition. W is 15 years old and C is 14 years old.  Both children are fully aware that they were the subject of care and placement proceedings, that their parents do not agree with the decision of the court and that the parents wish the boys to be returned to their care.  Within this context, the information set out in the petition will not result in the children becoming aware of views held by their parents&#8217; regarding their placements of which they were previously oblivious.   Whilst it may be said that, if it is permitted to remain online, the fact of, and the information contained in the petition acts to reinforce in the children&#8217;s minds their parents lack of acceptance of their placements following the outcome of proceedings, once again there is no evidence before the court that this is <span style="font-style:italic">in fact</span> the case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Likewise, the local authority provides no specific evidence to support its contention that the presence of the petition, and its contents will disrupt efforts to find adoptive placements for T and N, or make an already challenging home-finding task more difficult, by discouraging prospective adopters from putting themselves forward.  The highest that Ms Duxbury can put that submission is to assert that the online petition &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">could create anxiety with potential adopters</span>&#8221;.  Once again, whilst it may be said that it is a common-sense proposition that prospective adopters will be more reluctant to consider children who are the subject of an active online campaign, each case turns on its own facts and the assumption must be interrogated by reference to the evidence before the court.  Within this context it is again important to look at the nature of the information contained in the petition.  The petition makes clear that the children were the subject of proceedings, that the parents opposed to the plan of adoption and that the parents do not accept, and continue to oppose the outcome of the proceedings.  All this is information that will be known to any prospective adopters.  Within this context, the information set out in the petition will not result in prospective adopters becoming aware of information they would not otherwise be privy to.   Whilst it may be argued that the presence of a petition indicating continued, active opposition by a parent following the conclusion of proceedings may act in more subtle ways on an adopter&#8217;s willingness to consider the children, once again this is an assumption rather than an evidenced fact.  Indeed, information communicated to the court by the mother following the hearing tends to suggest that the local authority has now located adopters for T notwithstanding the existence of the online petition.</p>

I accept that the fact that information is already in the public domain does not prevent injunctive relief where it can be shown that the repetition of known facts about an individual amounts to an unjustified interference with the private life of that person (see<span style="font-style:italic"> JIH v News Group Newspapers Ltd </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/qb/2010/2818" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 2818 (QB)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 2818 (QB)</ref> at [59]).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The information contained in the petition setting out the mother&#8217;s objections and assertions regarding the fairness of the proceedings is, as I have outlined, relatively innocuous (once again, it does not contain details of the evidence before the court or details of the harm the court was satisfied that the children have suffered and does not seek to discuss the children&#8217;s individual needs), particularly when compared to other information that the courts have permitted to remain online (see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (Reporting Restriction)</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"/>where the information in question was a video of the execution of an emergency protection order showing the child being removed in circumstances that were distressing, which video the court permitted to remain online subject to an order requiring the anonymisation of the name of the child).   Further, the local authority offers no evidence to suggest that a petition placed online in response to a judicial decision in 2016, to which 160 people signed up and which received its last signature two months ago, is likely to be accessed in future years by others to the extent that it will result in embarrassment to the children, much less emotional harm.  Again, whilst it is possible to <span style="font-style:italic">speculate</span> that this might be the case, given the nature of the information and the relatively small number of people who have accessed it at a time when it is relatively current, the court needs more than mere speculation before such a conclusion can be drawn.  I also again bear in mind that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref> does not act to prevent child being identified as having been the subject of proceedings. </p>

Within this context, once again, it must be remembered that what the court is examining is whether there is evidence which amounts to a justification for interfering with the cardinal right of freedom of expression for the purposes of Art 10(2).  Whilst it is, of course, possible to formulate a number of common-sense <span style="font-style:italic">assumptions</span> with respect to the potential impact on each of the children of persons accessing the online petition, the reality is that the justifications on which the local authority seeks to rely for interfering with the parents&#8217; right to freedom of expression under Art 8 are poorly evidenced and largely speculative in nature.</p>

But it is well recognised that it is also instrumentally important. It serves a number of broad objectives. First, it promotes the self-fulfilment of individuals in society. Secondly, in the famous words of Holmes J (echoing John Stuart Mill), &#8220;the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market&#8221;: <span style="font-style:italic">Abrams v United States</span> (1919) 250 US 616, at 630, per Holmes J (dissenting). Thirdly, freedom of speech is the lifeblood of democracy. The free flow of information and ideas informs political debate. It is a safety valve: people are more ready to accept decisions that go against them if they can in principle seek to influence them. It acts as a brake on the abuse of power by public officials. It facilitates the exposure of errors in the governance and administration of justice of the country.&#8221;  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the context of the right of the citizen to petition Parliament or the Government in respect of a personal grievance being of fundamental constitutional importance, it is also important that citizens in the position of these parents, who consider that they have a personal grievance, can express themselves by articulating their grievances fully and effectively by way of petition, gain support for their views and, by doing so, seek redress.  Further, in circumstances where, as the parents do here, a person seeks to petition the State for redress in respect of a personal grievance arising out of alleged actions of the State, it is particularly important that the State should not, without very good reason, be permitted, as it seeks to be permitted here by way of an application for injunctive relief, to restrain that person from petitioning.  Indeed, once again, whilst I did not hear detailed submissions on the point, it is arguable that the prohibition on &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">commitments and prosecutions</span>&#8221; with respect to petitions seeking redress contained in the Bill of Rights of 1689 would render such restraint unlawful. </p>

Against this, the ability of a parent to make clear <span style="font-style:italic">who</span> is speaking out or seeking to petition for redress is self-evidently very important, it being very difficult, if not impossible, to effectively protest a contended for injustice or petition for redress of a personal grievance if the protester or the petitioner must remain anonymous and prevented from providing any salient details of their grievance that may breach that anonymity.</p>

Applying the ultimate balancing test of proportionality, in my judgment it cannot be said in this case that compelling the parents to take down their online petition directed at Parliament and Government, or compelling them to remove from the petition the mother&#8217;s name and the responses which utilise the forenames of the children, represents a proportionate response to the risk to the psychological integrity, personal development, development of social relationships and physical and social identity of the children presented by the limited amount of information concerning the children that the petition now contains.</p>

The court is required to balance a right that is important to the individual subject children, children who will often have been exposed to significant personal trauma, against a cardinal right that is important to parents, to children and to society as a whole.  Where the court is required to strike this balance, a solution that comprehensively satisfies all interests is not possible.</p>
