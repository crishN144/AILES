The Local Authority does not seek any findings in relation to sexual abuse, its case being that an objective analysis of the evidence leads to a conclusion that the court could not find the allegations to be made out to the requisite standard of proof. The central issue in the case is therefore whether some or all of the allegations made by T have been caused by manipulation, pressure or coaching by the Mother, or whether she has developed an unreasonable belief that T has been sexually abused. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In order to determine this matter, it is necessary to set out in considerable detail the history of the allegations and their precise timing. It is a feature of the case that the vast majority of the alleged allegations have been made by T to the Mother alone, which the Mother then passed on to various agencies. The Mother kept a diary or notes of what she says T said to her. What is set out below includes the Mother&#8217;s evidence of the dates that she says T told her about the alleged abuse without any acceptance on behalf of the court as to the veracity of either the dates or of what the Mother alleges was said. </p>

I heard evidence about them, and I will therefore make findings of fact. However, their significance is very much less than the issues around T&#8217;s alleged allegations of sexual abuse.  The Mother also alleges that the Father was responsible for T having small quantities of cocaine found in hair strand tests dating back to around September 2018.  </p>

The Mother says they only lived together for a relatively short period and the relationship ended in 2016. The Mother had bought her own house and lived there with T. The Father had regular contact with T seeing him a few times during the week and staying overnight once a week. The parents lived very close to each other in a small community. </p>

The police were called out on a number of occasions. The Father accepts in his response to the Mother&#8217;s allegations that there were arguments and that he sometimes behaved badly but claims the arguments were two-way.  Despite these problems the Father did have regular contact with T and the Mother supported this contact.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There was an incident in March 2018 when the Father took T to a local pub, Pub X. I have heard a number of witnesses to what happened but ultimately the precise details of the fight that occurred are of no relevance to the principal issues in this case. However, the Mother has sought findings in relation to this incident. It seems the Father was looking after T that day and had taken him to the pub, as he often did. They met some friends and T went home with one of them. The Mother phoned the Father and asked for T to come back to her. When T was brought back to the pub, one of the Mother&#8217;s friends, RP, said she would take him home. The Father declined to hand him over and an argument ensued. The Father says that he was quite happy for T to go to the Mother but felt RP was interfering. I have no doubt that the Father had had a good deal to drink and was belligerent at best and aggressive at worst. The Mother then arrived, and an altercation broke out at which the Father was to some degree physically aggressive to RP. The Father says RP &#8220;ran into his arm&#8221; but this seems somewhat unlikely. A friend of the Mother, PO, then intervened at which stage the Father punched him, PO then hit the Father who came off the worse from the encounter.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The point of relevance for me out of this incident is that T was in the pub for most of the altercation. The Father says that T and the Mother had left by the time PO and the Father started to fight but if this is correct it was only by a few seconds and certainly not because the Father was restraining himself until T had left. It is very troubling that a young child, 4 at the time, was exposed to drunken violence in this way. However, I note that neither parent appeared to be particularly troubled at the time and the Mother did not seek to prevent the Father&#8217;s contact, him taking T to the pub, or raise concerns with social services. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I have seen a series of text messages through the summer of 2018 between the Mother and the Father. It is apparent from the messages that the court does not have all of the communications between the parents and, as the Mother says, there must have been other electronic devices on which they were communicating. However, what I can glean from the messages I have seen is that the Father and Mother got on reasonably amicably most of the time. The Father seems to have been keener to maintain a close relationship, but the Mother accepts that they were friendly, albeit the Father was highly unpredictable both in his behaviour and in his general attitude to her. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 14 September the texts suggest that there was some dispute over contact arrangements. T had just started at primary school and the Father attended the school asserting, correctly, that he held parental responsibility. The parents were spoken to by the Headteacher but there is no note of what was said.  On the same day the Mother contacted Rochdale CSC reporting that the Father was becoming awkward over contact with T and saying that he will take him from school. The Mother did not feel that the Father would follow through with this but that it was him &#8216;sounding out&#8217;. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">According to the Mother, at some point during the day she noticed T putting his hand up an adult friend&#8217;s skirt. Later that day when putting T to bed he told her that he had a secret game with his daddy and he played with daddy&#8217;s willy and his daddy had played with his. The Mother rang her friend, HS, and told her about T&#8217;s conversation. She took a video of a conversation she then had with T about what he had said earlier. In this video the Mother is very clearly prompting T to repeat what she says T told her earlier. I do not in principle criticise the Mother for this as she had not been trained as to how to question a child. However, the video is essentially worthless in trying to establish either the truth of what T was alleging or, more importantly for my purposes, whether T had originally made the allegations at all, or whether he had been prompted into it by the Mother. What is clear from the video is that T does not appear to be in the least upset. I agree with Ms Whiteley that what T is describing sounds more like a silly game than a child recounting a frightening or worrisome experience.  </p>

There is no evidence of this type of sexualised behaviour from anyone other than the Mother. JL, who the Mother and T were living with and the maternal grandmother, MG, say that T appeared to be very difficult at this time and quite distressed, but neither of them say anything about sexualised behaviour. I note at this point that it would be hardly surprising if T was acting in a difficult and disturbed way. He had been removed from his home and normal surroundings and from his Father, and his Mother, for whatever reason, was plainly in a very upset and highly stressed condition.  </p>

Criticisms were made of the way that the ABE interviews were conducted. However, ultimately this is of little relevance to my consideration because T made very limited allegations in only one of the ABE interviews and no party is now suggesting that the Father did sexually abuse T. Although I am confident that the ABE Guidance was not followed in all respects, there is nothing to suggest that the conduct of the interviews was so poor that this led T to make further allegations.  </p>

Mother alleges that T said the brown men always used to come every week and that strangers used to come as well who weren't friends with daddy or NN, they used to bring other boys, they were the same age as him apart from two who were 9 and 10 years old, they would make them all do rude games to each other and take photos. Mother alleges that T said that what's really weird is that they took pictures of him smelling slug poo. Mother alleges that T had said some of the boys would cry like babies when daddy and the other men put their willies in their bum but he was brave like daddy said, all of the strangers gave daddy money so he was rich. </p>

Dr Thornton has worked in the field of sexual abuse since 1995 and has seen over 3000 complainants of sexual assault. She was instructed by the solicitor for the child in the private law proceedings to produce an independent medical report. She produced a very detailed report which concludes that examination of T&#8217;s presentation neither confirms nor refutes sexual abuse having taken place. This report was subsequently shown to Dr Tee who did not disagree with its conclusions in respect of the urethral meatus (opening) but did not appear to express a view on the anal examination. Ultimately the degree of Dr Tee&#8217;s agreement matters not at all, because the Mother does not seek to challenge Dr Thornton&#8217;s conclusions.  </p>

He said there were five boys involved, V was brought there by his dad and grandad and sometimes NN would bring him, NN&#8217;s girlfriend&#8217;s daughter F was there, but she did not join in the rude games. She would watch. Other children were strangers without daddies and Q used to bring them. Q didn&#8217;t do rude games but filmed them on his camera and took pictures. They had to wait in the bedroom to be called in. He listed V&#8217;s dad (JS Junior), V&#8217;s granddad (JS), PR, BA and KE.

A few points are very clear when the chronology is considered as a whole. Firstly, T&#8217;s allegations escalate and become more extreme and bizarre over time. Secondly, T initially seems attached to and relaxed about his Father, describing him as his &#8220;hero&#8221; according to the Mother, and telling Ms Burrow he wanted to see his Father. However, that changes to a position in June 2020 where he says that he wants his Father to be killed and he hates him. There can be no doubt that T has suffered real emotional harm through this long sequence of events, and that was not caused by any actions of the Father.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The final step in the chronology is that the Mother seeks findings that on 15 July 2020 the Father was heavily intoxicated and abusive to HS and threatened her. This is alleged to have taken place in Pub Y. Having heard HS and the Father&#8217;s evidence, I fully accept that the Father was very drunk and abusive.  </p>

She said that she had believed T on 1 July 2019 when he told her that other children were also being abused, as well as all the other adults being involved. However, she did not report this to the social worker until 7 August. She claims that this was because she was frightened, but she had not been too frightened to tell the social worker T had made allegations about other adults and she pursued a case against those other adults, seeking to have them joined in this action, until September 2020. </p>

She explained this by saying that she had not really understood her previous legal advice and it was only when Mr Howe and Mr Flood became involved that she realised T was not telling the truth. I find this explanation exceptionally difficult to believe. Her new counsel team may have explained the legal position to her more clearly than those in the past. But this does not explain why she no longer believed any of the allegations that she says T made. </p>

He sought to minimise both his alcohol and cocaine consumption.  I will return to this in my conclusions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This case is difficult because it involves trying to establish what the Mother was thinking at various different points in the chronology where the evidence is almost entirely the Mother&#8217;s own reporting at the time. I would have benefited from a psychological assessment of the Mother, but Mr Jones told me that the psychological service approached by the Local Authority had advised that assessment work and intervention with the family was only possible after the court had made its findings of fact. Looking back with the benefit of hindsight, I do not think that this was the most helpful approach. As the trial turned out, I was not being asked to determine facts about whether T was sexually abused, but rather I was trying to determine the reasonableness of the Mother&#8217;s apparent belief in T&#8217;s allegations, and whether she had exaggerated or encouraged T&#8217;s allegations. This problem has arisen because of the Mother&#8217;s very late change of position in the litigation, and I must do the best that I can with the evidence, and particularly the chronology, that I have. However, the psychological assessment which all agree should follow this judgment will be critical in determining what orders I make in respect of T.  </p>

T probably did make some initial comment to the Mother that was open to an entirely innocent explanation. The Mother may have seen him putting his hand up a woman&#8217;s skirt, which is not unusual for small children, and he said something about daddy touching his willy in the shower. The Mother, with a tendency to over dramatization which was referred to both by MG and by her sister in the NSPCC phone call, took T&#8217;s comments and let them spiral out of control. The Mother then fed those allegations and encouraged T to make more allegations. In my view there came a time, when the Mother was at the very least embellishing the allegations, possibly in a very ill-judged belief that this was helping T by stopping the Father having contact.

However, I agree with Mr Gilmore that there is no single strong catalyst that would have led the Mother to have made up the allegations and then leave her home and job all as part of a pure fabrication. There were arguments about money and the Father had been asking for more contact and &#8220;parity&#8221;, and this may have put pressure on the Mother. However, the Mother had supported contact with the Father in the past, even in the face of what many would consider as totally unacceptable behaviour by him. </p>

She then made a considerable sacrifice by giving up her house and work and moving to live with JL. There is then a long history of her reporting allegations to the police, social services and Ms Taylor. This would all amount to a very complicated fabrication and one that was damaging to the Mother herself and, as such, seems inherently unlikely. The Mother did not strike me as someone who would have deliberately and in a calculated manner, made up the initial allegations. However, right from the start the Mother was encouraging T to make allegations, and seemingly praising him for doing so. I suspect that from midSeptember T thought his Mother wanted him to make ever more extreme allegations against his Father and that was a good way for T to get attention and praise.  </p>

Ms Taylor unquestioningly believed everything the Mother recounted to her and therefore that T had been abused. It was plain from Ms Taylor&#8217;s evidence that she continues to believe this, even though the Mother does not. I have no doubt that Ms Taylor believes she was doing the best for T and the Mother and intended nothing but good. However, she has, I am afraid, seriously confused her role and undoubtedly made a difficult situation very much worse. It was apparent from her evidence that she took an unquestioning approach towards allegations of sexual abuse and saw her role as giving total support to the alleged victim. That support included not contemplating the possibility that T and/or the Mother were not being truthful or had become confused. The effect of her conduct was to affirm the Mother in the strength of her beliefs and probably to make T more worried and more fearful of his Father.  </p>

Secondly, she may well have heightened T&#8217;s fears particularly by strongly encouraging his use of the worry monster and plainly making him feel that &#8220;feeding&#8221; the worry monster was to be praised. I am not a child psychologist and I have not heard expert evidence. It is however easy to see that a worry monster, although sometimes undoubtedly useful for young children, may become a way of encouraging further allegations and &#8220;disclosure&#8221; and feeding a young child&#8217;s imagination. </p>

I fully accept that professionals must be able to criticise and question judicial decisions, but Ms Taylor appears to have little or no understanding of the considerations that the court will have been balancing when deciding that indirect contact should take place. I am not conducting an investigation into the training and supervision of ISVAs, but it is clear that something went seriously wrong in this case. </p>

On 13 May Dr Thornton&#8217;s report was filed which set out why T&#8217;s presentation neither confirmed nor refuted sexual abuse. I can accept that this might not have immediately led the Mother to revise her position. However, in the light of that report, any reasonable parent would have started to question in their own mind what T was allegedly saying.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The evidence shows that the Mother was involving T in effectively backing up what she was saying, as referenced by the conversation with Ms Taylor on 6 June when T says that Ms Burrow is wrong to say that the Mother is lying, rather than T. This can only have been said because the Mother was quite inappropriately discussing the position with T. There are then the extreme allegations which are supposed to have been made by T on 1 July involving other children. I cannot tell whether the Mother made up these allegations or whether she encouraged T to make ever more extreme allegations. I accept Mr Jones&#8217;s submission that by mid-2019 the Mother was becoming increasingly frustrated and angry with the court process and the Local Authority and was therefore wanting the allegations to become more extreme in order to support her case for no contact. If she had genuinely believed the allegations involving other children, then in my view she would have reported them. She had never previously held back from reporting allegations because she was scared of either the Father, NN or anyone else. Possibly she was doubtful of the truth of the allegations, possibly she was conscious that she was leading T into making more extreme allegations. The evidence suggests that the Mother had little or no understanding or interest in the way that her leading questions could lead T into making wild allegations. Without a psychological assessment of the Mother, I cannot conclude with any confidence what was in her mind from May 2019 onwards. I can however conclude, without any doubt, that from a point in mid-2019 it had ceased to be reasonable to accept T&#8217;s allegations at face value.  </p>

He could not have got these details from watching some pornography on his Father&#8217;s phone. Further, there are details of precisely how people take cocaine, which again strongly indicates that his Mother was guiding what he said or embellishing it. I do not accept Mr Howe&#8217;s argument that T got whatever sexual knowledge might have been reflected in these conversations from watching pornography on the Father&#8217;s phone. I think these lurid allegations are far more likely to have been made up by the Mother, possibly with T simply acting as an echo chamber.

I do not think the Mother was a truthful witness in this regard.  I accept the Father&#8217;s evidence that the Mother took it with him in August 2018 as he was very straightforward about this. I do not find that the Father tried to force T to take cocaine. I therefore find both parents are responsible for T&#8217;s exposure to cocaine in or around September 2018.
