Should it, in common with each of the preceding judgments, be published in full (subject to some minor redactions), or should the court restrict publication to a summary of the key elements of the decision? Given the degree of publicity that has hitherto taken place, all three parties agree that some form of summary of the decision should be publicly released to mark the conclusion of the proceedings.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 23 February 2022, the court heard submissions from each party on the issue of publication of the Welfare Judgment. The mother&#8217;s settled position for some time has been that the judgment should be published in full, subject to some modest redactions. In the weeks prior to the hearing, the children&#8217;s guardian, [redacted], had considered that publication should be limited to a summary, and this, too, was the view of the father. The position of the parties significantly changed, however, in the final day or so prior to the hearing in that the guardian reconsidered her position in the light of a full statement that had, by then, been filed by the children&#8217;s mother and following a further meeting with the children. In the event, the guardian&#8217;s final position was to support the mother by advising the court that publication of a full version of the judgment was justified (albeit with some additional redactions to those suggested by the mother). On the eve of the hearing the father&#8217;s solicitors wrote to the court and the other parties to inform them that the father had adjusted his case in the light of the guardian&#8217;s account of Jalila&#8217;s most recent views (which had to a degree changed) and the guardian&#8217;s revised recommendation. The letter indicated that the father did not intend to take issue with either the guardian&#8217;s proposed summary or the guardian&#8217;s proposed redacted judgment, provided that whichever was chosen was acceptable to the court. The letter, however, went on to record that &#8216;the father respectfully suggests&#8217; that both the children&#8217;s interests and the public interest is better served by the publication of a coherent and accessible summary, rather than publication of the judgment itself.</p>

For the court to be in such a position is no more than a reflection of the highly unusual nature of the outcome that is sought by the mother and which is, now, supported by the guardian and no longer vigorously opposed by the father. None of the most experienced and well-resourced legal teams have been able to find an example of a welfare judgment relating to children that has been published in circumstances where the children are explicitly identified. In the present case that situation is compounded by the fact that, not only would the children be named in the judgment, but the circumstances of this family are already well known to the public and the children are, in any event, public figures in their own right in Dubai and elsewhere.</p>

Often, the reason for doing so will be because the decision provides a useful example of a particular issue being played out in the proceedings, or because some other aspect of the decision is of interest to the legal and social work professions. Alternatively, a judgment may be published in compliance with the current guidance &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Transparency in the Family Court: Publication of Judgments</span>&#8217; (16 January 2014).

Unusually, the arguments that are relied upon in support of publication focus upon the welfare of the children and their Art 8 and 10 rights (and those of their mother) to have their &#8216;story&#8217; accurately and neutrally available for public scrutiny in order to avoid their private and family lives being adversely affected by the children&#8217;s father causing a false narrative about the outcome of the case to be promulgated.</p>

Mr Spearman asserted that, if the mother&#8217;s fears are accepted, then they can be met by the publication of an appropriate summary. Whilst a fuller account than had initially been put forward on behalf of the father might be needed, that would be sufficient to explain the outcome of the welfare determination, without the need for any further detail. The guardian&#8217;s team had produced a fuller summary, and this was now supported by those acting for the father as being the right level of detail and there was no need to publish any further detail.</p>

Whilst the Family Court regularly publishes judgments where issues relating to the welfare of children have been determined, invariably the identity of the child concerned is not disclosed. Researches by counsel have failed to find even one example of a child being publicly named as being the subject of a judgment in which their future welfare is determined. That firmly established default position is reinforced by the statutory scheme in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">AJA 1960</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 12</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/97" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 97</ref>. In the context of the ECHR, and the balance that must be struck in each case between competing rights under Articles 6, 8 and 10, there will often be little or no public interest in naming individual children and the balance will, therefore, be heavily weighted against doing so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s opinion is, in large part, based upon her apprehension that, if any leeway is available to him, the father and those acting for him would populate any informational gap or vacuum with their own account which, on the basis of past behaviour, would be a false one aimed at manipulating public opinion in his favour in a manner detrimental to the children and their mother. Previous findings of the court with respect to statements made by the father support the mother&#8217;s evaluation of the potential for just such an outcome. Recent posting of photographs on Instagram by those close to the father, which appear to be a deliberate attempt to suggest that His Highness is back in face-to-face contact with his son, are strongly supportive of the accuracy of the mother&#8217;s prediction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I share the view of Ms Magson, summarised at paragraph 25 above, that substantial weight is to be afforded to the reasoned opinion of the children&#8217;s mother. The court has already, when making the welfare determination itself, identified the impressive and wholly child-centred manner in which Her Royal Highness has discharged her responsibility as a parent of her two children over the past three years. In a way that is simply not open either to Ms Magson, or to the court, Her Royal Highness has an insight into, and an understanding of, the father, those around him and the wider cultural issues. Unless it has good reason not to do so, there are strong grounds for the court to respect and to follow this mother&#8217;s opinion on the issue of publication.</p>

Save for the protection of particularly private information, she favours publicity. [redacted]. Jalila is now 14 years old. She is an intelligent and mature individual, whose considered views must attract substantial weight on this important issue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, in terms of the attribution of weight, separately and independently, the professional opinion of Ms Magson in support of publication of the judgment must also be afforded significant respect by the court. That is particularly so because of the very favourable view that I had already formed of the way in which Ms Magson had undertaken her professional duties at the time of the substantive welfare hearing. In addition, it is plain that she has brought anxious and careful consideration to bear on the current issue of publicity before, on balance, moving to favour publication of the judgment rather than a summary.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These powerful considerations must, however, be weighed against the very firmly, and rightly, entrenched default position in favour of confidentiality which I have already outlined. I place very little weight on the asserted need for consistency arising from the fact that all of the previous judgments have been published; the Welfare Judgment is in a separate category and requires a bespoke evaluation without any presumption as to publicity that may arise from the manner in which the earlier judgments have been approached.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In considering this issue, I have very much in mind that the children are approaching a sensitive stage in their education. It is hoped that this small family will develop a wider group of social contacts and friends. There is plainly a risk, as Lord Pannick describes, of intimate details being picked up from any publicity and used to Jalila and Zayed&#8217;s detriment by children and/or parents connected with their respective schools. On the other hand, Her Royal Highness is concerned that, unless there is full publication, there is the potential for greater harm to be caused by those same children or parents inadvertently picking up and deploying untrue or manipulated accounts.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Drawing these matters together, I am now persuaded that a much fuller account of the court&#8217;s welfare determination must be published. A solid, detailed and clear account is needed to meet the legitimate concerns of Jalila and her mother. In addition, publication of the judgment will enhance the arrangements for the children&#8217;s safety. That means that a short statement simply recording the outcome that I had previously considered would be insufficient. I am reassured that my change of view on this is justified by the fact that the father, too, has revised his position so that he now supports the publication of a statement in line with the detailed draft prepared on behalf of the guardian.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The decision therefore moves to the choice between a full and detailed statement or publication of the judgment itself, subject to some redaction. The guardian&#8217;s draft statement runs to over 1,700 words. It includes, in summary form, a description of each of the factors that were seen to be of relevance to the welfare determination. It therefore contains a good deal of personal information about the children and their parents; information which would normally be confidential, but which it is now agreed should be made public. What the summary does not do is recite the detail from the court&#8217;s previous findings and from the evidence adduced at the welfare hearing, which are set out in support of evaluation of the identified factors. The summary, also, does not include a full account of the court&#8217;s welfare analysis.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I consider that the draft is a good and accurate summary, but, having now read it a number of times, I am concerned that, having given so much detail, it begs the question of what further material the court took into account, and how it did so, in forming its ultimate conclusions. Put another way, whilst the summary aims to capture the headline points in the court&#8217;s evaluation, and in doing it puts those points, and the fact that the court considered them relevant, out into the public domain, I am concerned that, by omitting the underlying analysis, the summary does not do justice to that analysis.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In any case there will be a spectrum, in terms of publicity, which runs from total confidentiality, at one end, over to total openness at the other. As the needle in favour of publicity moves across such a spectrum, there must come a moment when a tipping point is reached where so much information is to be published that little is to be gained by withholding the remainder. My considered view is that the degree of publicity represented by the guardian&#8217;s draft falls into this category. So much of the structure and the headline points made in the Welfare Judgment is now, with the father&#8217;s agreement, to be published, that it is difficult to identify any principled reason for withholding publication of most of the remainder.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s case, of course, is that, in any event, publication of the whole judgment (subject to redactions) is required as being in the best interests of the children and, in particular, for their personal safety. I have already concluded that very substantial weight must be afforded to the mother&#8217;s advice, and Jalila&#8217;s opinion, and, in turn, to the guardian&#8217;s endorsement of their positions. Regrettably, the factual basis upon which the mother&#8217;s stance is based, that is the potential for the father and those acting for him to utilise any summary or informational vacuum created by the absence of full publication to promulgate untrue accounts of matters relating to the children&#8217;s welfare, is sound. Her appraisal of the risk of harm, which would be continuing rather than time-limited, from false information is, in my view, entirely reasonable. In the circumstances, I am persuaded that she is right that it is therefore necessary to remove the potential for conjecture, manipulation and/or falsehood as to the content of the judgment by its publication, rather than publishing only a summary. </p>
