	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application made by the Birmingham Women&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s NHS Foundation Trust, pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court, to grant declaratory relief. The declaration is sought in respect of a 6-year-old girl (J) who is suffering from a very rare terminal neuro-degenerative genetic condition, known as NRROS-gene deletion (negative regulator of reactive oxygen species). The NRROS-gene encodes proteins which are essential for brain development and function. The abnormality of that gene causes neurodegeneration, including febrile seizures, infantile spasms and focal and myoclonic seizures. The Trust seeks a declaration that it is in J&#8217;s best interests for her not to be given mechanical or invasive ventilatory support and for what are referred to as, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;ceilings of treatment&#8221;</span> to be put in place. J is represented by her Guardian, who supports the Trust&#8217;s application. J&#8217;s parents strenuously resist it. Though this hearing has taken place in open court, the family has been vigilant to protect J&#8217;s privacy. Her name and anything that might identify her has been protected by order of the Court and continues to be. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is necessary to set out the medical background which, it should be noted, is extensively agreed between the parties. It is also important to emphasise that whilst the parents disagree with the Trust&#8217;s application, they do so, in my judgement, primarily on religious and cultural grounds. They do not question the commitment, professionalism, and sincerity of all the medical professionals involved. On the contrary, they have an obvious respect and gratitude to them for all they have done for their daughter. That respect is entirely reciprocated. All who have encountered this family have admired their care, compassion, and generosity of spirit. Their courage and resilience have inspired all who have been involved in their lives, in whose number I include myself. </p>

Her birth weight was 3.2 kgs. She was born in good condition and required no resuscitation.

J was presented to the Worcester Royal Hospital, in December 2017, having suffered a prolonged, generalised tonic seizure with eye rolling. Following this first seizure, J started to demonstrate regression of her motor and cognitive skills and, sadly, went on to suffer a second seizure after an interval of approximately a month. She was started on sodium valproate in January 2018, which was, at least initially, effective in controlling her seizures. However, due to escalation of seizures, levetiracetam and nitrazepam were prescribed during May and June 2018. A CT brain scan demonstrated; <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;multiple areas of calcification predominantly in the sub-cortical and peri-ventricular distribution except for tiny calcification in the lentiform nucleus, no lesions within the thalami. There is ventriculomegaly with dilatation of lateral and third ventricles&#8217;</span>.</p>

Her electroencephalogram (EEG) was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;very abnormal&#8221;.</span> Steroids were added to J&#8217;s anticonvulsant regime; these initially had a beneficial impact, but this proved to be transient. Different combinations of anticonvulsant medications were tried, including a ketogenic diet. It proved difficult to eliminate her seizures, although they were described as not particularly burdensome in terms of their frequency and duration at this point.<span style="font-style:italic"/>In March 2019, J was admitted to Worcester Royal Hospital with fever, vomiting, and a chest infection due to Influenza A. Her seizures became more prolonged and difficult to control. She developed respiratory failure and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. J was transferred, once again, to BCH Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). J remained in PICU for one month and spent the next 4 months in hospital.</p>

In summary there has been a dramatic deterioration of the EEG with frequent brief seizures, non-convulsive status epilepticus in sleep and abnormal rhythms suggesting a diffuse cortical dysfunction.&#8221;</span></p>

In March 2022, whole genome sequencing data demonstrated that J suffers from an inherited genetic defect of the NRROS gene. As I have previously stated, this is an extremely rare terminal neurodegenerative genetic condition. Research has revealed that there appear to be no more than 15 documented cases worldwide. Each of those cases follows a very similar trajectory to that I have set out above. What is a particularly distressing feature but, sadly, not unique to this disorder is that the children all seem perfectly well in their first 18 months. </p>

Professor Stephen Playfor was instructed, on behalf of the parents, to conduct an overview of J&#8217;s medical history and to provide an opinion. Though I have no doubt that much hope was invested by the parents in his considerable expertise, Professor Playfor was very clear that mechanical ventilation was not in J&#8217;s best interests and that the clinical emphasis should be focused on palliative care in the community. Because he was unable to support the parent&#8217;s case, he was called to give evidence by Ms Victoria Butler-Cole QC, on behalf of J.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Professor Playfor constructs his analysis by reference to the principles identified by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) published in March 2015: <span style="font-weight:bold">Making Decisions to Limit Treatment in Life-limiting and Life-threatening Conditions in Children: a Framework for Practice. </span>This sets out circumstances under which withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment might be ethically permissible. The RCPCH guidance also clarifies that in the medical context, just as in these legal proceedings, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the ethical basis for withholding or withdrawing life-supporting therapy (LST) involves consideration of a child&#8217;s best interests&#8217;</span>. Though the guidance is familiar to practitioners, I propose to summarise it in order to give context to Professor Playfor&#8217;s conclusions. The RCPCH guidance identifies three paradigm circumstances where limiting treatment should be considered because it is no longer in the child&#8217;s best interests to continue it, because treatments cannot provide overall benefit. These are as follows: </p>

It is important for me to emphasise that this analysis has not been advanced in these stark terms by the doctors. Each of the medical professionals, from whom I have heard, has enormous respect for and sympathy with these parents. Their language has been unfailingly sensitive. The familiarity of both parents with the medical issues reflects not only their deep commitment to do anything humanly possible for their daughter but also the time and effort expended by the medical staff in explaining what the frequently complex medical issues are.  All this said, it is important not to hide from the stark reality of the doctors sensitively expressed medical conclusions. </p>

He did not consider that automatically permitted the possibility of pleasure as a logical correlative. Indeed, he considered it unlikely that J could experience pleasure. As I have foreshadowed, there were different perspectives on this point, although the differences reflect the diversity of clinical expertise rather than any disagreement. Broadly similar opinions are arrived at through the filter of the individual discipline.

The worst-case scenario... is that she feels pain but that this cannot be detected by all of the usual mechanisms as she appears to give no response at all. In the best-case scenario, it seems likely that it is not in her best interests to continue to admit her to hospital for resuscitation, as to do so maintains her in an ever more increasing frequency of admissions that are now arguably prolonging the dying process of her brain. In the worst-case scenario, such admissions are likely to cause suffering that is not outweighed by positive benefits, such as being able to enjoy life.

This was further supported by the clear brain atrophy revealed on the MRI scan and the consistently abnormal EEG confirming encephalopathy and epileptic activity, additional to that seen in the extensive seizures, some of which last more than an entire day.  Nonetheless, the epilepsy, the apnoea, the desaturations were in Dr R&#8217;s view, likely to cause some remaining physical discomfort. </p>

He impressed upon me that there is a bond between parent and child which gives the parents an advantage in understanding nuances of behaviours that the professionals might not otherwise recognise. F did not, in any way, disavow J&#8217;s manifest deterioration. His simple point, expressed with conviction, is that J is not as unaware of her surroundings as the doctors believe. To illustrate this, he tells me that when J is at home, she experiences markedly fewer convulsions. This, he says, signals her capacity to respond to a quieter more private environment, surrounded only by love and care from her parents and her brother. There is nothing to gainsay this. </p>

I am prepared to accept that J suffers fewer convulsions at home, as F describes, and most likely for the reasons he expresses. The wider evidence is not consistent with this but neither do I regard it as being irreconcilable with it. It has been noted that J shows no response to instances of upheaval in ICU and shows no pain with cannulation. But I am prepared to permit of the possibility that along with the capacity for residual pain, there may well be a residual capacity for an experience of tranquillity and human affection that, within the limits of what J is able to experience, can accurately be described as pleasure. In her evidence, the mother (M) whilst kind and polite to all those who have assisted her daughter, described a level of awareness that was, in my judgement, ultimately an expression of her hope and aspiration but was jarringly irreconcilable with the broader evidential picture, including that given by F. </p>

F attends Mosque very regularly. Prayer is part of his life. He presented to me as a spiritual man with a love of Allah. This is a family who have had to draw deeply on their faith to survive the many vicissitudes that they have encountered. J was the couple&#8217;s first-born child. Her name, in Arabic, signals the hope for the future that both parents invested in her. The brutal unfairness of what has happened to J, following everything else this family has experienced, is painful even to consider. Nobody can imagine how they feel. Theirs is a pain which goes beyond human empathy. For reasons with which I need not burden this judgment, I had occasion to notice in court what a close, loving and supportive couple they are. If good parenting can properly be described as a gift, then it is certainly one that has been bestowed upon them. M is a traditionally dressed Muslim woman who is modest and polite but has strong convictions and an unfailing tenacity when fighting for her family. </p>

Even though he absorbed and understood the medical evidence, F&#8217;s faith drew him in a different direction. It is difficult to capture his thought process but, as I understand it, for him, where life is sustained, even with burden and with no identifiable medical benefit, it permits of hope and prayer and for this reason he believes it to be in J&#8217;s best interests.

Even though its precepts run in such a starkly contrary direction to the medical evidence, I have given it intensely careful thought. However, there is no prospect here that home ventilation could achieve any medical benefit for J. Relatively little may be known about her genetic disorder, but the extent and significance of her neurodegeneration is all too apparent. She is beyond treatment that can make her &#8216;better&#8217;. From this perspective, a decision not to provide home ventilation cannot be equated with a decision <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;not to help&#8221; </span>J, which F described as the Muslim obligation. She is beyond medical help, but she is not beyond physical burden. Ultimately, surveying the broad canvas of what could contribute to an understanding of J&#8217;s &#8216;best interests&#8217;, it is the impossibility of reconciling burdensome intervention with treatment that is ultimately futile, that weighs most heavily. J&#8217;s life as a human being has unique and intrinsic value, not only because she is J, but because she is a human being and remains so, even when she becomes, as she is likely to do, entirely beyond pain. Her entitlement to protection of her personal autonomy also must be factored into the fabric of those issues that illuminate where her &#8216;best interests&#8217; lie. <span style="font-style:italic">In North London Clinical Commissioning Group v GU,</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2021/59" uk:canonical="[2021] EWCOP 59" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWCOP 59</ref></span>, I observed the following: </p>

The purpose of the best interests&#8217; test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221;&#160;(per Baroness Hale)</span></p>

Indeed, it will follow that it will not be lawful to give it.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The court must face head on the question of whether it can be said that the continuation of life sustaining treatment is in Tafida&#8217;s best interests. There will be cases where it is not in the best interests of the child to subject him or her to treatment that will cause increased suffering and produce no commensurate benefit, giving the fullest possible weight to the child&#8217;s and mankind&#8217;s desire to survive. In this context, I do not discount the grave matters prayed in aid by the Trust. However, the law that I must apply is clear and requires that the best interests decision be arrived at by a careful and balanced evaluation of all of the factors that I have discussed in the foregoing paragraphs. Having undertaken that balance, in circumstances where, whilst minimally aware, moribund and totally reliant on others, Tafida is not in pain and medically stable; where the burden of the treatment required to keep her in a minimally conscious state is low; where there is a responsible body of medical opinion that considers that she can and should be maintained on life support with a view to placing her in a position where she can be cared for at home on ventilation by a loving and dedicated family in the same manner in which a number of children in a similar situation to Tafida are treated in this jurisdiction; where there is a fully detailed and funded care plan to this end; where Tafida can be safely transported to Italy with little or no impact on her welfare; where in this context the continuation of life-sustaining treatment is consistent with the religious and cultural tenets by which Tafida was being raised; where, in the foregoing context, transfer for treatment to Italy is the choice of her parents in the exercise of their parental responsibility and having regard to the sanctity of Tafida&#8217;s life being of the highest importance, I am satisfied, on a fine balance, that it is in Tafida&#8217;s best interests for life sustaining treatment to continue. It follows from this conclusion that I am also satisfied, the court having determined the dispute regarding best interests in favour of the treatment being offered to Tafida in Italy, there can be no justification for further interference in Tafida&#8217;s EU right to receive services pursuant to Art 56.&#8221;</span></p>

Indeed, I have never encountered a case where the facts of <span style="font-style:italic">Raqeeb</span> have arisen. J probably experiences a degree of residual pain. Paradoxically, the parents own evidence is highly supportive of that proposition. Moreover, it must be emphasised that J has lost the ability to exercise any control at all over her own body. She is completely and totally dependent for everything on others. She has lost the ability to communicate and has, on any view, only the most limited awareness. Her seizures are highly distressing to watch and are accompanied by increasingly burdensome apnoeic episodes creating significant respiratory distress which have led to the increasing number of admissions to PICU that I have charted above. Sadly, and for all these reasons, I do not consider mechanical ventilation to be in J&#8217;s best interests. </p>
