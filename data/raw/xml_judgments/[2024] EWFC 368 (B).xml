They may arise for a number of reasons.  One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability, another is that they are lies told for other reasons.  Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account.  The possible effects of delay and questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.  As memory fades, a desire to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural, a process which might inelegantly be described as &#8220; story creep&#8221; may occur without any inference of bad faith.&#8221;</p>

The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities.  However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence &#8230;</p>

Yet not all such behaviour will amount to &#8216;domestic abuse&#8217;, where &#8216;coercive behaviour&#8217; is defined as behaviour that is &#8216;used to harm, punish, or frighten the victim&#8230;&#8217; and &#8216;controlling behaviour&#8217; as behaviour &#8216;designed to make a person subordinate&#8230;&#8217; In cases where the alleged behaviour does not have this character it is likely to be unnecessary and disproportionate for detailed findings of fact to be made about the complaints; indeed, in such cases it will not be in the interests of the child or of justice for the court to allow itself to become another battleground for adult conflict.&#8221;</p>

I will address where this particularly impacted a specific allegation later in my judgment, but I must bear in mind, in a general sense, she was being asked to recall, in some detail, events, some of which took place many years ago and some of which occurred over an extended period of time.  For instance, in relation to allegation 1, the signing-in book, in cross-examination she initially said only her writing would have been found in it, but a few moments later said, &#8220;He would sometimes sign the book,&#8221;, although explained that when she said it was her writing in the book, she did not view his signature as writing as such.</p>

Fundamentally, whilst I find that is certainly possible, it seems very improbable.  As I say, it is not for the father to prove a motive and I am entitled to take into account what motive there might have been in assessing the mother&#8217;s credibility and to take into account the lack of an obvious motive to fabricate what she alleges. </p>

It started with her telling us that her husband wielded a metal baseball bat around the house against the children and her and she wanted to know if that was normal.  We were horrified and told her explicitly that this was not normal or acceptable.  Her question was prompted after she first told us about the baseball bat.  She said something like he just spends all his time running around with a baseball bat.  This made us chuckle and when we saw she was not laughing we asked her what was wrong and she said you don&#8217;t understand he runs around threatening the children with it all the time and they&#8217;re terrified.

As I explained to the investigating officer in my interview at the police station on the day I was arrested, I purchased the bat as a last resort with which to defend my family if ever our home was attacked by intruders &#8230; I do admit to having role played on two or three occasions, maximum, the role of a police officer with a whistle and baton to get my younger kids to comply with bedtime routines etc, when they were especially hyperactive.

She fled to me as she shared the room with C4.  The younger girls followed quickly as their father had become enraged and they were frightened.  C4 was distressed by everyone&#8217;s fear and began to cry.  The respondent demanded we allow him into the bedroom.  He was shouting loudly and I moved the cot to block the door because I was afraid he wanted to hit C1 for disobeying.  I simply wanted to protect all the children in their state of terror, so close to their bedtime.  He shoved and banged at the door and we feared it would open, so we all climbed into the cot to weight it down.  The children were all screaming with fear and crying.  He continued trying to shove the door open for several minutes, before eventually leaving us.</p>

When I asked him how he discovered he could not get in, he admitted to initially using normal force and then trying to push harder and when counsel for mother put to him, &#8220;You shoved and banged at the door,&#8221; he tried to evade directly answering by saying, &#8220;I would have tried to get in, yes.&#8221;</p>

He might be concerned, having seen it, but not clear why he was monitoring it in the first place.  Secondly, it was not an isolated example of monitoring.  There is the message at the top of page C109, as I have already referred to, but there is a further message at C120.  In the course of that message, the father asked the mother if she had allowed C1 to take  C4 to the park by herself.  That was a message sent at 23.47 on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2023. The father denies that that information was obtained from remote observation by cameras in the home.  At C161 he said he had called to speak with the children at 18.30 and C2 had said C1 was out of the park with C4 and &#8220;it was already getting dark&#8221;. </p>

If he was genuinely concerned about C1 being out with C4 at the park at 18.30, I would have expected the message to have been sent around that time, not much later in the evening.  His evidence on that point was extremely evasive.  I asked him why there was the delay and he said, &#8220;By then, the mother would have been free from putting the children to bed.&#8221; I asked what time they went to bed and he said C1 last at 21.00, so I asked him again the reason for the delay thereafter of two and three quarter hours, and he said, &#8220;I might have been at a social event.&#8221; That does not does not sit easily with the earlier message which is also seen at C120, timed at 21.03, asking &#8220;Did you call?&#8221; i.e. he was not so occupied that he couldn&#8217;t message the mother at 21.03 and it is not clear why he could not, at the same time, have asked her why was C1 taking C4 to the park?
