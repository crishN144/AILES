In terms, I refused the application for disclosure of the entire court file but I did so on the basis that Ms Newman should be permitted to have access to certain documents which I identified in a schedule which I propose to attach to my order.  Ms Newman was represented throughout by her legal team on a pro bono basis.  The local authority, on the other hand, has incurred substantial costs in relation to the application.  In agreeing that it will not seek to recover any of its costs, the local authority has been guided by the President&#8217;s Guidance on Reporting in the Family Courts (3 October 2019).  In that document at paragraph 16, Sir Andrew McFarlane said this: </p>

The reasons for that decision are set out fully in the mainframe judgment.  As to what that redaction exercise will entail, I am told that the solicitor who has been dealing with the matter throughout will be best placed to undertake the task.  The process will not be straightforward and she is familiar with the papers and knows what will be required.  In particular, I am told that there are over 150 pages of experts&#8217; reports alone which will need to be carefully redacted to protect the private information relating to the child.  The local authority has estimated that it will take the solicitor up to 10 hours to complete this task.  At an hourly rate of &#163;95.00, this element of the claim for costs would be a maximum of &#163;950.00 plus VAT. </p>

They will only charge on the basis of time actually spent.  Ms Rogers reminds me that the local authority has already met significant costs in relation to the administrative exercise which had to be undertaken in notifying relevant third parties affected by Ms Newman&#8217;s application for disclosure.  It was also responsible for preparing the court bundles which were used for the purposes of the final hearing.  No claim is being made for these costs.  Furthermore, I am reminded that Ms Newman has been on notice throughout the proceedings that the local authority would be seeking an order which required her to pay for the costs of providing whatever documents the court decided she should see. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.25in">First, as a matter of principle, Ms Proops QC, with her two junior counsel, submits that it would be wrong in principle for the local authority to seek to transfer to a member of the public the burden of any costs incurred as a result of complying with an order which this court has made.  Thus, where the court has made an order which permits the disclosure of selected documents to Ms Newman, it is for the local authority to meet the costs of complying with that order.   In pursuing that submission, Ms Proops reminds me that the limited disclosure which I have permitted engages important Article 10 rights which </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.7in;margin-right:0.25in">Furthermore, she seeks to argue that the imposition of a costs order on Ms Newman is likely to be disproportionate in terms of its impact on her financial situation.  Whilst it is acknowledged that different considerations may apply in circumstances where an individual journalist is in the employment of a substantial media organization, Ms Newman has no such employer to whom she can look for support with costs.  She has made her application for entirely legitimate reasons, as the court has acknowledged, and, whilst she has not succeeded in her application for the release of the entire court file, she has secured a limited release of information and documents from the proceedings.  Were she now to be penalised in costs, it might deter other professional journalists from pursuing similar orders in future which might well be contrary to the public interest. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.71in;margin-right:0.25in;text-indent:0in">Newman does offer to meet the local authority&#8217;s reasonable copying charges.  Thus, there appears to be no issue in relation to the <span style="font-style:italic">copying</span> exercise; the challenge lies in relation to the costs of the <span style="font-style:italic">redaction</span> exercise which Ms Proops and her team suggest is wholly disproportionate both in relation to the work which needs to be undertaken and Ms Newman&#8217;s ability to meet those costs having regard to her means.  Were she to be required to meet these costs, Ms Proops submits that she is unlikely to follow through with a request that these documents are produced to her.  Whilst she has made a significant professional investment in the case, she is simply not in a position to afford the sums claimed by the local authority and there is no prospect of offsetting against that liability any payments she might in future receive as a result of her journalistic endeavours.  In these circumstances, it is submitted on her behalf that a costs order would &#8220;render the Court&#8217;s judgment a dead letter and have a silencing effect on the exercise of the Applicant&#8217;s Art.10 rights&#8221;. </p>

She has exhibited a number of exhibits to that statement to support the narrative she provides in her statement.  I do not consider it appropriate to record those details in the body of this short judgment on costs.  Suffice it to say that I am satisfied that a costs burden of &#163;1,200 would be very likely to result in her abandoning her request for the documents which I have allowed her to see.  I agree that a costs order against her in terms of the redaction exercise which I have required the local authority to undertake would place a disproportionate burden on her shoulders and is likely to render the whole exercise nugatory.  She has had the considerable benefit of professional support from her legal team which has acted for her on a pro bono basis throughout.  They have been prepared to undertake that work without seeking payment for what has been a very significant amount of work because they, like Ms Newman, have a professional investment in the principle of open and transparent justice in the Family Courts. </p>

I have also considered carefully the extent to which this local authority has already incurred costs in relation to this application.  It has incurred the costs of instructing leading and junior counsel.  In addition, such was the importance which was attached to the outcome of the application that I was told that a senior team manager had attended the two day hearing.  In no circumstances can it be said that the local authority has taken this application lightly and/or that it has not done what it can to assist the court in circumstances where Ms Newman&#8217;s team were instructed directly with the result that there was only one administrative legal department running the case.  I have taken well on board the financial impact on a local authority which currently has to juggle a significant number of calls on over-stretched resources.  Weighing all these matters carefully in the balance, and in accordance with the discretion which I have in relation to costs, I propose to order Ms Newman to pay the costs of the copying exercise limited to &#163;45 per hour plus VAT.  There will be no order in relation to the costs of the redaction exercise.  These must be absorbed by the local authority.  I hope that it will prove to be possible to contain those costs to something less than the ten hours of professional time claimed but Ms Newman will not be liable for the costs of that exercise. </p>
