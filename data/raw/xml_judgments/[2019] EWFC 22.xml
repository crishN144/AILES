This court is extremely fortunate to have members of the legal profession who are willing and able to assist in situations such as this, and to provide such excellent advice and assistance.

They have been spoken to by Miss Catto, the Children's Guardian, and have confirmed through her and the documents they have signed, their agreement to this court making a parental order.  Due to the unusual history of this case and the fact that it is likely the children would remain abroad the children were joined as parties. Miss Catto, who had been the parental order reporter, became the Children's Guardian. They have been represented by their solicitor, Ms Thomson, and Ms Fottrell Q. C., both experts in this particular area of the law. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0in">"It is established practice in adoption applications with international elements for the court to notify the Home Office and ask whether it wishes to intervene in the case.  As a result of this practice, consideration of the role of the Home Office is to be given at the first directions hearing in an application for adoption as provided for in Practice Direction 14B of the Family Procedure Rules, rule 14.2D(ii).  It is not always necessary to do so in applications for Parental Order applications, nor is it required by the Family Procedure Rules part 13. It is clear however that in this case that notification and/or invitation should have been given on the face of the court order to the Home Office, the Passport Office and the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office at the first opportunity after it had become apparent that there were difficulties in the children leaving India.  As noted by both Ms Cronin and Ms Logan it was only when the matter was the subject of an order and request made by a High Court judge that formal if partial explanations for the delay were forthcoming." </p>

In those circumstances, with the agreement of the parties, the court has heard the submissions of the parties, is giving this judgment but will adjourn making an order until the SSHD has been served with the application and had the opportunity to make any representations. </p>

They came to the United Kingdom, as A was at risk in Iran as a result of his political views.  They settled in England and have lived here ever since.  B applied for and was granted British citizenship, and subsequently applied and obtained a British passport. A was given unlimited leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

A said he had difficulties at that time in sleeping, also had taken up smoking which caused difficulties for B.  A&#8217;s statement confirms he would take their child to school each day, remained very much involved in the day to day family life despite living separately during that period from his wife. </p>

Following a short admission to hospital, the child was supported in the community, and discharged from that service.  Very tragically their child died in an accident.  Understandably the applicants have, in their separate ways, struggled with their child&#8217;s death.  They both describe in their statements the enormous sense of loss they have felt at their child&#8217;s untimely death, and how that loss is still felt by each of them.  At para.35 of her statement B expresses this as follows:</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0in">"I will always miss and mourn for [our child].  It's not something you can ever truly recover from.  I cry when I talk about [our child], but I do not consider that to be unusual or surprising.  The early years carry the intensity of grief but years later the loss can hit you at any time without warning, and feels as intense as it did in the immediate aftermath of [our child&#8217;s] passing.  I manage my grief and sadness.  Special days are particularly hard.  I was offered counselling, but never went to it as I did not feel that it would help me.  I did go to a church and meet other people who'd lost children.  I went three times and it was helpful.  I recall that A went to counselling two or three times." </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.08in">There is no doubt that was an enormously difficult and traumatising time for both of them.  They considered, following their child&#8217;s death, that they still wanted to be parents again, and discussed the possibility of having another child.  However, B&#8217;s health, and her age, were against that option; as a result the parties began to look at surrogacy.  Their investigations led them to a Clinic in Iran.  In her statement at para 42 B describes what took place as follows: </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0in">"I started the enquiries when we were in Iran.  We were speaking with C, who is a distant relative, and E.  Both were aware of the tragic events in our family.  The issue of surrogacy came up.  The idea was put forward that E would help us arrange the surrogacy using C as a surrogate.  They acted purely for humanitarian reasons, and they are both kind and caring individuals.  The surrogate obviously had the agreement and blessing of her husband as well." </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0in">"The clinic advised about the surrogacy itself, and the intermediary helped with the paperwork, including the surrogacy agreement [which is in the bundle] which was signed by C and her husband.  All the procedures were followed under the guidance of the specialist doctor and the Clinic.  The contracts were processed by a notary public office specialisation in this particular field.  The relevant paperwork and their translations relating to both the surrogate mother and her husband have all been submitted to the court." </p>

There were probably, as she describes, three times before the pregnancy, and once after the birth.   A surrogacy agreement was signed, and a translation of that agreement is in the papers.  The agreement refers to B&#8217;s eggs being used, and until very recently that was C&#8217;s understanding as well as her husband.  This was what B had stated when the parental order application was issued. In fact, donor eggs were used. B said as follows at para.50 of her statement in relation to her feelings about being a mother: </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0in">"I knew immediately how much I loved being a mother.  I knew too that we had so much to offer a child, and how much love and security we could give them.  It was certainly a process for me to come to accept that I was not able to give birth to our child, and then that the child would not be made of our genetic material.  I needed time to process that, but I also knew that biology was such a small part of the picture.  It was after this that we accepted the option of a donor egg. Having come to that realisation myself however, it had been more difficult to be outwardly open about it.  We are intensely private people.  To lay open so much of ourselves in such a public way has been difficult.  I wanted so much to be their natural mother, and I felt guilty that I could not be.  I realise now that maintaining there was a genetic connection when there is not was wrong, and I have caused some delay for the court and the immigration process as a consequence, for which I am personally very distressed. E, the intermediary, knew that the eggs were donated.  I don't know what the surrogate knew at the time, but I can assure the court I've now told her the eggs were donated.  She was not concerned about this, and just wanted to help us." </p>

The guidance says that the application for a parental order must have been made within six months of the child's birth, and that evidence must be provided to suggest that a parental order is likely to be granted.  The guidance also provides that applicants should try and meet as many of the usual rules as possible, for example, ability to maintain and accommodate, and that they have broken ties with the surrogate mother.  The guidance says that leave to enter for twelve months will be granted. </p>

On arrival in the UK they must notify the local authority that the child is living with them so that they can monitor the child's welfare.  The guidance also provides that once a parental order is made, an application can be made for indefinite leave to remain and to register a child as British. </p>

There is no suggestion the applicants have done other than act with good faith and have not sought to circumvent any of the relevant authorities.  For those reasons, if required, any payments made other than for expenses reasonably incurred are authorised. </p>

In my judgment the evidence points in the opposite direction; the welfare needs of these children require a decision to be made.  </p>

As Miss Catto observes, there is a very strong welfare case for the children and the applicants to be together sooner rather than later in the family home in England. </p>

They describe in those paragraphs the network of support where they live in England, including neighbours and friends who they feel they will be able to draw on.  It is right to note that there is one aspect that has caused this court some concern. It is the way, for understandable reasons, the pregnancy and birth has been presented to family and friends both here and to the family in Iran.  </p>

That will avoid the confusion for these children in the future if the incorrect history of how they came to be born, and where, is maintained.  I invite the Local Authority to consider whether this is an issue that they would be able to provide assistance for A and B to take these steps, as the court is clear such a step would be in the children's best interests. </p>

As noted above, I have seen the children via Skype visits on two occasions, and had no concerns about their welfare or presentation during these calls, and in fact I assess them as to be making good progress, and be happy children.  The children were dressed in clean and age and weather-appropriate clothing, and appeared alert and well-settled in their environment.  A was physically present for the children for one of the Skype visits, and although I was not able to observe him performing any specific parenting task, I did have the opportunity to see them together, and I could observe the warm, loving relationship between them. </p>

A and B have showed me photographs and videos of the children in which they appear to be doing well, and I have observed the intended parents to speak warmly and proudly about the children.  It is my understanding from the family GP there are no welfare concerns in relation to the commissioning couple's basic care of their eldest child, and agency checks indicate the family has not had any previous involvement with the Local Authority Children's Services, which would suggest that there were no issues in their care of their child previously.  I remain concerned however that there are several areas in relation to the personal and practical circumstances of the intended parents which, when considered cumulatively, could indicate a need for the provision of support moving forward to ensure the children's long-term welfare. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.23in;text-indent:0in">Given the understandably significant impact that their child&#8217;s passing has had upon the intended parents, I remain of the view that they will need to have access to additional support when the children arrive in the UK, to assist the parties in adjusting to the emotional demands and physical practicalities of parenting in the wake of such a significant loss.  This will be particularly necessary if the children present with any developmental delays or issues arising from their prematurity or otherwise. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0in">The financial circumstances of the intended parents also cause me some concern. [&#8230;] Furthermore, whilst B and A made practical preparations for the children by purchasing cribs, clothing and other necessary equipment, there has been significant delay in this case, meaning that the children's needs will have changed, and they will likely need to purchase new more age-appropriate equipment.  Though the intended parents do not envisage any immediate issues in meeting the children's financial needs, this again could impact on their welfare needs in the longer term, and could mean that additional support is required to ensure that they are provided with information and support to access any alternative funding streams, for example, ensuring they are in receipt of appropriate benefit or making charity applications for additional funding." </p>

And so, whilst as a matter of law here, they are the mother and father, they expressly do not wish to exercise those rights.

Whilst I do not demur at this stage from her welfare analysis, for the reasons that I set out at the beginning of this judgment, I am satisfied that even though the criteria have been met, and that making a parental order on the information the court has at the moment would meet the children's lifelong welfare needs, I consider, for the reasons I have given, that it is appropriate that there is a time-limited adjournment to enable the SSHD to be given notice of this application. </p>

Whether those applications are granted is, of course, a matter entirely for the SSHD.  Whatever view the court has formed about the warm and loving relationship the applicants have with the children, these early years are important periods for establishing safe and secure attachments for these children with the applicants.  I would invite consideration of any immigration applications to bring these children to this jurisdiction to be determined as quickly as possible, so, depending on the outcome of those applications, the applicants can then make whatever arrangements need to be made for the welfare needs of these children. </p>
