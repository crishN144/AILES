	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I am concerned with two children, Y, a boy, who is 11 years old, and his sister, X, who is four years old. They have different fathers: Y&#8217;s father is called CD and X&#8217;s father is called AB. Like CD, the mother was born in Poland and she came to this country in 2005. On a trip back to Poland in 2006 she met CD and they began a relationship, with him following her to this country shortly thereafter. It is unclear when their relationship ended though nothing turns on the point. AB was born in England and, save for a brief period as a child, he has lived in this country all his life. He met the mother by way of online dating and they were in a relationship from about April until June/July 2014 when the mother fell pregnant with X. DNA testing has confirmed AB is X&#8217;s father. Both X and Y live with their mother and have always done so. Their contact with their respective fathers lies at the heart of these proceedings.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The local authority issued public law proceedings in March 2019 within pre-existing private law proceedings concerning X. Those proceedings were stayed in consequence and this matter was listed before me by Mr Justice Keehan in order that I might determine the factual basis upon which the threshold criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> were met, if relevant. In summary, the local authority&#8217;s case was that the children had suffered and were likely to suffer significant emotional harm arising from the mother&#8217;s false and inaccurate allegations that (a) AB was physically and sexually abusing X when he had contact with her and (b) CD had physically harmed Y when he had contact with him. Both AB and CD denied the mother&#8217;s allegations that they had either sexually or physically harmed their respective children during contact. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Until the pre-hearing review on 9 December 2019, the mother maintained that the court should determine serious allegations of physical and sexual abuse made by her against AB which were particularised in a schedule contained in the court bundle. However, on that date, and following legal advice, the mother accepted that the court would be unlikely to make the findings she sought against AB. She reluctantly conceded that the court would proceed on the basis that AB had not sexually or physically abused X. However, the mother denied that she had been the author of either actual or likely significant emotional harm to both children as the local authority asserted. That position was maintained by her until the day upon which I was due to begin hearing witness evidence.    </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Having read into the case in accordance with the local authority&#8217;s reading list and also viewed video material, some of that viewing taking place in the presence of an officer from West Midlands Police, I made some observations to the parties in court prior to the commencement of the witness evidence. Those observations were intended to assist the forensic process and to remedy evidential gaps, the most significant of which was the absence of any chronology identifying when X and Y had had contact with their respective fathers over the last three years. During exchanges with counsel that day, it became apparent that the mother conceded the threshold criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref> of the Children Act were satisfied. Further, the local authority accepted that it was unlikely to persuade me that the mother had deliberately made false allegations of abuse against AB. I allowed the parties time for discussion and eventually the parties </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is important that I summarise the parties&#8217; positions at the time they made their oral submissions to me. The local authority and the mother disagreed as to the precise basis upon which the threshold criteria were satisfied in relation to X, each producing their own threshold document. In essence, the mother submitted that the threshold document prepared by the local authority gave insufficient consideration to her involvement with the local authority which had failed to stop the cycle of allegations and which was inconsistent and unhelpful to both her and the children. In particular, she took exception to the detail of the manner in which her beliefs about AB&#8217;s behaviour had resulted in harm to X. Both the mother and the local authority agreed that a judgment to set in context the threshold findings would be crucial given the need for expert assessment of the adults and the children in order to inform welfare decisions. Such a judgment was also vital given the criticisms made by the mother about the manner in which local authority professionals had engaged with her both before and during the private and public law proceedings.  </p>

CD submitted that, whatever had occurred between Y and CD, this could not account for Y not wishing to see his father. He accepted the threshold formulation agreed by the mother and the local authority with respect to Y. The children&#8217;s guardian urged me to accept the local authority&#8217;s threshold document and to provide in my judgment assistance to professionals about the context for the threshold findings. </p>

The court must also guard against reversing the burden of proof. I consider this to be especially important in cases such as this one where the mother has made some, but not all the threshold concessions sought by the </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">local authority.  Second, the standard of proof is the simple balance of probabilities. The inherent probability or improbability of an event remains a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred. Third, findings of fact must be based on evidence (including the inferences which can properly be drawn from the evidence) and not on speculation or suspicion. Fourth, the decision on whether the facts in issue have been proved to the requisite standard must be based on all the available evidence and should have regard to the wide context of social, emotional, ethical and moral issues. It is vital that the court does not evaluate the evidence in separate compartments. Rather, regard must be had to the relevance of each piece of evidence to other evidence and the court should exercise an overview of the totality of the evidence in order to come to a conclusion whether the case put forward has been established on the balance of probabilities. Fifth, the court should bear in mind that a witness may tell lies in the course of the investigation and the hearing. Lies may be told for many reasons such as shame, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear or distress.  The fact that a witness has lied about some matters does not mean s/he has lied about everything. A lie is not direct proof of guilt though it is capable of amounting to corroboration. </p>

Her relationship with AB was short-lived by comparison with that involving CD but I am in no position to make findings about the circumstances in which that relationship ended. What is absolutely clear was that the mother expected more from the relationship with AB than he did of his relationship with her. She gave birth to their child with whom AB had little involvement until his paternity was established by DNA testing in December 2015.  </p>

In November 2015 she contacted the local authority saying that she was frightened to offer contact and asked for help. No reasons for her concerns about contact were recorded. The mother was told not to permit contact if she was concerned about X&#8217;s safety and advised this was a private law matter rather than one which required involvement by the local authority. In May 2016 the mother told her health visitor during a home visit that she thought AB was requesting contact to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">get at</span>&#8221; her.

He was reported to have banged on the door and to have left when the mother did not answer the door. No offences were disclosed.  I am unable to make any findings about whether this incident took place as the mother reported. The police officer noted that he had viewed text messages from AB to the mother which were not threatening, and which concerned his liability for maintenance. The mother was said to be willing to permit AB to have contact with X, but she did not want this to take place at her home. She was given details of local facilities which might assist her. Shortly thereafter, on 11 June 2016, AB had contact with X for the first time at a soft play centre, this being supervised by his sister. Regrettably no contact then took place until 28 January 2017.  </p>

The GP reported this to the local authority who then tried to contact the mother without success. Instead, a supportive letter was sent to the mother&#8217;s home address. In her statement, the mother alleged that she had also refused further contact as AB had attended the soft play centre smelling of alcohol. AB disputed that he behaved as the mother alleged and, having heard no evidence on this issue, I am unable to determine whether the mother&#8217;s allegations about his behaviour were established.

It was agreed by them that X should have contact with AB on a Saturday morning for two hours which would initially be supervised and would then increase. In consequence of that agreement, AB saw X on 28 January 2017, his contact being supervised by the mother. A further three sessions of contact took place as arranged but thereafter AB complained that contact took place sporadically. Nevertheless, a court order dated 22 May 2017 provided for AB to have largely unsupervised contact with X every Saturday, initially for three hours but increasing incrementally to seven hours. AB was also granted parental responsibility for X. Significantly, the order recorded that there were no safeguarding concerns reported by Cafcass and there was no requirement for any further involvement from Cafcass. A final court order was made on 14 July 2017 in the following terms: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the child shall live with both parents as a final order. X will live with her father for the times set out below and otherwise will live with her mother</span>&#8221;.

The breakdown in contact came hard on the heels of the mother reporting in early October 2017 to the local authority and then to the police that X had returned from contact with a mark on her face. It is however apparent that the mother was troubled by X&#8217;s contact with her father before that date. On 2 August 2017 the mother told the health visitor that AB was having regular contact with X and this made her anxious. She reported that she had been recently diagnosed with depression by her GP and was taking medication for this. On 2 October 2017 the mother once more told the health visitor during a home visit that she was anxious when X was in her father&#8217;s care. The health visitor encouraged her to contact the local authority if she felt there were any safeguarding concerns.

She said the nursery told her to contact the local authority and to seek legal advice. Acting on that advice, the mother told the local authority of her concerns and was advised to seek legal advice and to ensure she safeguarded X. She was told that, if X had injuries after contact, she should consider contacting the police. The local authority closed the mother&#8217;s referral that same day.  </p>

Rather surprisingly, the mother travelled to London on 22 October 2017 with X in order to consult with a clinical psychologist about X&#8217;s behaviour. In her witness statement dated 7 June 2019, the mother said she had taken this course because of the lack of action by the local authority in response to the allegations made and because she was at her &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">wit&#8217;s end</span>&#8221; as to what she could do for her daughter.  Her statement recorded that the psychologist had not asked X anything and had sought to reassure the mother by telling her that children did not tell lies. The mother felt this visit &#8211; for which she had paid privately - was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a bit of a waste of time</span>&#8221;.  No records of this visit were in the bundle, so it was difficult to come to any firm conclusions about the rationale for this trip. However, it seemed to me to be a clear indication, at the very least, of the mother&#8217;s heightened anxiety about both what X was reportedly saying and how she was reportedly behaving.  </p>

Though the justices expressed disquiet about the way in which these allegations had emerged, they varied AB&#8217;s contact to X by ending overnight contact and substituting alternate weekend contact to be supervised by the father&#8217;s sister.

The chronology of which agency was contacted first is very unclear from the documents I have seen but nothing turns on it. A neighbour contacted the police and/or the local authority to report the mother had spoken to him in some distress, feeling like she had not been listened to. Both the police and the local authority contacted the mother who repeated her account of X coming back from contact with marks on her face. She also spoke about X putting toys in her pants such as scissors and a toy rolling pin and saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Daddy do it</span>&#8221;. Furthermore, X smacked herself whenever she wet herself and, in consequence, the mother believed AB was hitting X when she wet herself during contact. X had also reported AB hitting his girlfriend on the face and making her cry. The mother explained that she had been to court that day and that the original contact order had been reinstated as there was no evidence to back up her concerns. She wanted someone to speak to X and wanted contact to be supervised.  The police decided that further information should be sought given the worrying matters the mother had reported and, I suspect in consequence, the local authority undertook an assessment which it completed on 5 February 2018.  </p>

The social worker challenged the mother about the mark and said she had seen X three days earlier to be quite happy in her father&#8217;s care. The mother was said to have become upset and asked the social worker to leave. It is important to record that X&#8217;s nursery had noticed none of the concerning behaviour described by the mother even though staff were aware of the allegations made against the father.

It was clear that the local authority was worried about the mother&#8217;s allegations which it was thought stemmed from her dislike of X&#8217;s contact with her father. There was concern the mother might be putting emotional pressure on X due to the mother not getting decisions from agencies or the court with which she was happy. The case was closed despite the social worker&#8217;s observation that she was worried X might have an intentional bruise in the future to evidence an alleged allegation. Whilst Mr Sampson characterised this statement as an extraordinary and spurious conjecture which evidenced a negative attitude towards the mother from the outset of the local authority&#8217;s involvement, it was, in my view, a statement which should have set alarm bells ringing for the social worker&#8217;s manager. If this was indeed what the social worker believed, the family, particularly the mother, ought to have been offered immediate advice and guidance around contact issues and child behaviour rather than the case being closed. </p>

Later that day the GP informed the local authority of the mother&#8217;s visit and was told that the local authority felt that the mother was trying to sabotage AB and falsely accuse him of sexual assault.

The mother conceded via Mr Sampson that she had begun recording X in a vain and ultimately damaging attempt to assure professionals that her concerns were genuinely held. The mother began recording X on 16 June 2018 prior to her attendance at the police station. During the video taken on that day, X was asked where she had been hurt and pointed to her face saying she had been hurt &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">with his hand</span>&#8221;. Another video was taken on 23 June 2018 which showed the mother playing a game with the children. The mother showed the children pictures and the children named the image on the pictures. At one point the mother showed a picture of a sex toy (a dildo) and X said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">daddy&#8217;s toy</span>&#8221;. Mother asked X what he did with it and X replied &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he fight me</span>&#8221;. These two videos were shown to the police round about the time they were made. The remaining recordings did not come to light until the hearing on 22 May 2019. </p>

X had never said anything which would raise concerns. The manager expressed this opinion about the mother: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Mum is a friendly woman who has shared her concerns with us and comes across as a mother that is raising concerns that no one is listening to at this moment in time. I feel from listening to mum it is quite apparent that she would like to be put at ease that the things her child is saying to her are not true and would like the appropriate support to help her at this time. She has expressed she is unsure how to handle the situation appropriately to get the answers she needs</span>&#8221;. The manager was also critical of the social worker&#8217;s negative view of the mother and stated she felt both parents needed support through mediation so that they could talk amicably in the future for the sake of X. Tellingly, she noted that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I feel that some comments that X may have shared could be lost in translation and if parents could communicate on civilised terms this could be cleared up</span>&#8221;. It is unfortunate, in my view, that this sensitive approach to the mother&#8217;s anxieties did not find favour with the local authority. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 24 July 2018 AB applied for a child arrangements order for X to live with him. In his application he said that the mother had made continuous allegations against him which were both unsubstantiated and untrue and he alleged that the mother had been teaching X to make untrue and inappropriate disclosures. In early August 2018 the local authority&#8217;s assessment set out its concerns in the following terms: (a) the emotional stress being placed upon the children by their mother; (b) the mother&#8217;s mental health; (c) the continuing allegations which were not substantiated; (d) the mother showing X a video with sex toys and asking her leading questions; (e) the mother starting to report that Y had seen his sister doing sexual behaviours; (f) the mother making an allegation of sexual abuse to the GP in spite of the outcome of the sexual health assessment; (g) the mother making it difficult for X to see her father and not respecting the court order. On 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>August 2018 an Initial Child Protection Conference took place and X was made the subject of a child protection plan under the category of emotional abuse. Amongst the recommendations made was one that the mother should seek a referral from her GP for a mental health assessment. Such an assessment was never undertaken as the mother&#8217;s GP was firmly of the view that the mother required no such assessment and was only suffering from mild anxiety which he felt was due to the circumstances surrounding the children and their fathers. Another recommendation was for the mother and AB to have mediation via Relate. The conference recommended that Y should have contact as soon as possible with his father. Finally, a new social worker, WL, was allocated to the family. </p>

She showed the social worker and team manager two videos she had taken of X on 28 September 2018. The first video showed X with her hand down the front of her leggings, rubbing herself. The mother asked X &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">so what daddy does to you princess?</span>&#8221;, to which X replied &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">like this</span>&#8221;. The mother asked what with and X said he did it with his finger. The mother asked if this was a nice finger and X said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">it&#8217;s a big finger</span>&#8221;. The second video showed X being asked by the mother what a rainbow colour was and she replied &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Daddy&#8217;s naughty toy&#8217;s a rainbow colour</span>&#8221;. She said he still had it but immediately thereafter said he had not and that the toy was in jail now. The local authority referred the matter to the police and the police record indicated that it was believed no penetration of X had taken place. A strategy meeting took place on 3 October 2018 which recommended a joint local authority/police investigation. Both the mother and X were seen the following day during a home visit which lasted for over two hours. X was spoken to and made no allegations and, when asked if daddy did anything to hurt her, she said no. She did not mention her father in a negative way at all during the entire visit.  </p>

When he was asked about sex toys, he said: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">now X does come into my house saying now this toy has been naughty, it needs to go to jail</span>&#8221;. The outcome of the investigation was that the police were unable to substantiate X&#8217;s allegation and took no further action. The senior officer was not satisfied either that the video was a true disclosure or that the child had not been groomed into the disclosure for whatever reason by the mother. He observed that the video started with both the mother and the child staring at the camera as if it was on pause and waiting for the record button to be pressed. In his view, the mother launched straight into asking leading questions to which X responded with words and actions. Contact between X and her father, which had been temporarily suspended for about two weeks, was accordingly reinstated. </p>

On 3 December 2018 the local authority filed a section 7 report authored by the social worker, WL, within the private law proceedings. WL stated that the constant allegations made by the mother against AB were concerning; that X had never disclosed anything to anyone apart from her mother; and that there was no evidence to substantiate any of the allegations made other than the disclosure made by X on video when questioned by her mother. It was the local authority&#8217;s intention to instruct an expert to conduct a psychological assessment which would consider whether the mother&#8217;s mental health might be impacting upon her behaviour. Until the outcome of that assessment, WL felt unable to make recommendations as to where X should reside, and which parent should be her primary carer. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I pause here to record that, within the local authority, there was a concern that the mother&#8217;s behaviour might be an example of parental alienation, namely where a parent with care alienates a child against a non-resident parent with whom the child is having contact, such that contact is no longer possible. Thus, on 24 September 2018, the Child Protection Conference Chair provided information to the social worker about (a) parental alienation and (b) the promotion of contact between fathers and their children where there was no evidence to suggest that children would be harmed by having such contact. The local authority&#8217;s approach was not assisted by differing views between the allocated social worker, WL, and her predecessor, CK. The case recordings make clear WL&#8217;s unhappiness with the view that this case was one of parental alienation by the mother. The difference in social work approach did not assist the mother whose reporting of alleged abuse stepped up a gear or more in autumn 2018. </p>

On 12 November 2018 the mother recorded a close-up image of X&#8217;s vagina. Whilst this image was on screen, the mother could be heard asking X questions such as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">where did he hurt it</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">how did he do it</span>&#8221;. X responded saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he hurt it with dadada</span>&#8221; and eventually said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he did, everything hurt me</span>&#8221;. At that point the video moved away from X&#8217;s genitals to briefly focus on X&#8217;s face before the image became blurred. Further questions were asked of X by the mother with the mother saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">is it painful a bit?</span>&#8221;, to which X responded saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">no it isn&#8217;t it&#8217;s just tired my bum</span>&#8221;. The mother then asked why X&#8217;s bum was tired and X replied &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I don&#8217;t know</span>&#8221;. The police regarded this as an indecent video given the close-up images of X&#8217;s vagina and genitals. On 29 November 2018 the mother made two further videos of X. In the first, X had her underwear pulled down making her vagina visible at the bottom of the screen. Once more the mother asked questions to which X responded &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he hit me</span>&#8221; and indicating by gesture she had been hit with a thumb. Again, the police regarded this recording as indecent, given the image of X&#8217;s vagina. The final video was taken on the same day, 29 November 2018. At the start of the clip X was heard telling the mother to kill her father with her sword because he had been naughty. When asked how the father had been naughty, X said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he hit me in the face like that</span>&#8221; and demonstrated by hitting her right hand across her own face and saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">crack</span>&#8221;.

The local authority record indicated that there was a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">tiny little speck</span>&#8221; on X&#8217;s head. X was asked how it had happened and she said it happened at her father&#8217;s home.

However, X then shouted &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he did it with a knife</span>&#8221; and went back to her play. The social worker could not be sure if X had heard her mother or was just repeating something she had heard. AB was informed by email about the mother&#8217;s visit later that day, the local authority making it clear that it was not treating what had happened as a child protection matter. The mark on X&#8217;s head was discussed at a core group meeting on 8 January 2019 when it was noted that X&#8217;s nursery had not seen the mark. </p>

These experiences are intrusive and are likely to cause the children fear and anxiety. Social care are concerned about [the mother&#8217;s] emotional well-being and how that may be impacting on the children. More recently [the mother] appears to be highly anxious and getting fixated over small things such as the issue of whether [AB] called Y a &#8216;dafty&#8217; or not. Dafty is more of a term of jovial endearment than an insult and, whether AB said it or not, [the mother&#8217;s] response to it two weeks after the alleged event is concerning. X has been quite unsettled in nursery for the past two weeks, social care and nursery have not been able to identify the reason for this yet, but it appears to be around the same time that [the mother] confronted [AB] about calling [Y] names.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 20 May 2019 a home visit was undertaken by the temporarily allocated social worker, PS. The mother told her she was not being listened to and, according to the local authority&#8217;s note, the mother believed that AB had sexually abused X. She told PS that she was confident in the evidence she had. That remark was significant as events at court two days later demonstrated. At the court hearing on 22 May 2019, the mother revealed she had in her possession a total of 10 videos in which X demonstrated/talked about abuse. Given this revelation, a strategy discussion took place on 24 May 2019 following which a police officer was assigned to view the videos and speak with the mother. When spoken to on 6 June 2019 by the police and the local authority, the mother confirmed that the 10 videos in her possession included three about which the father had been spoken to previously. When asked why she had not shown the remaining seven videos to police or other professionals before, the mother said she did not do so as she felt nobody believed her. The mother was asked whether, since November 2018, X had said anything similar to what she had said in the videos and the mother said that she had not. X had apparently stopped talking about the naughty toys in November 2018 and the mother believed that AB was scared and was being careful. The mother went on to say that, around Christmas 2018, X talked about having a secret with her daddy, but the mother had been unable to find out what the secret was. The social work analysis following the investigation concluded that the mother had recorded the material for the purpose of gathering evidence against AB. Three of the videos which showed X&#8217;s genitalia were described as a breach of her dignity. If the mother was concerned about X&#8217;s welfare, her failure to show the material to professionals involved with the family meant that measures could not be put in place to investigate and safeguard X. Though three of the videos contained indecent images, the mother had inadvertently created these images in an attempt to record verbal &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">disclosures</span>&#8221; from X. In those circumstances the police decided not to press criminal charges against the mother. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Before I come to my conclusions about the threshold dispute in this case, it is important to note that what this judgment cannot do, save insofar as the same is either conceded by the mother or clear from the evidence, is to determine what caused the mother to act in the manner in which she did. Her behaviour was clearly a product of her state of mind at the time and requires further expert assessment. In saying that, I fully acknowledge that the behaviour of others such as AB and the professionals involved may have impacted upon the mother&#8217;s state of mind, but she alone was ultimately responsible for the care her two children received. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I have carefully scrutinised the two threshold documents submitted by the mother and the local authority. Insofar as they concern X, both are substantively similar and spell out the basis upon which the court can find that, as a result of the mother&#8217;s behaviour, X suffered and was likely, at the time public law proceedings were issued, to suffer significant harm. Before I set out my reasons for preferring one version over the other, it is important that I address the allegations of physically/sexually inappropriate behaviour by AB, X&#8217;s father. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The mother accepted at the hearing before me on 9 December 2019 that she no longer pursued findings of fact about alleged physical or sexually inappropriate behaviour by AB. That concession means this case will proceed on the basis that AB has not physically or sexually abused X and I make a finding to that effect, as all the parties accepted I should. All assessments, which will inform the welfare hearing, will be conducted on that basis. I prefer the local authority&#8217;s formulation in paragraph (a) of its threshold document which stated unequivocally that AB was not abusing his child. The formulation set out in the mother&#8217;s document was insufficiently clear that AB had not abused his child.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I can deal with this dispute shortly. The mother&#8217;s formulation was, in my opinion, too generalised. It is important that the professionals working with this family understand in clear terms the wholly unacceptable consequences of the mother&#8217;s beliefs for X. The videos she made of her child represented a gross error of judgment and placed X under pressure to say what her mother wanted her to say. I endorse the local authority&#8217;s description of the indecent videos as constituting a breach of X&#8217;s dignity. The existence and contents of this material demonstrate why expert assessment of the mother is vital to a resolution of these proceedings. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr Sampson&#8217;s submissions were critical of the local authority&#8217;s involvement with the mother. He pointed to an absence of assessment, a lack of support, mixed messages which included repeated advice not to permit contact, and the local authority&#8217;s dogmatic view. His submission that all of this led to a polarisation of positions not only between the mother and AB but also between the mother and the local authority has some force. My summary of the background has identified, at various points, less than optimal responses by the local authority. </p>

Those concessions were both helpfully and properly made on behalf of a local authority keen to learn lessons which could be applied to similar scenarios in the future. This case will not be the last in which a local authority is drawn into private law proceedings where very serious allegations of child abuse are made by one parent against the other.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is my perception that local authorities may be ill-equipped to grapple with complex private law proceedings where there are allegations of abuse made by one parent against the other. Though it is trite to observe that social workers are well aware that children can be harmed in such situations, translating that knowledge into effective social work practice is rather more difficult. There is little specific assistance to be derived from the contents of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Working Together To Safeguard Children</span>&#8221;. Furthermore, an organisational resistance to sustained involvement in what is seen as essentially a dispute between separated parents may also be in play in circumstances where local authorities are hard pressed to manage their child protection workload. This case demonstrates the need to develop more coherent and child focused ways of working with families such as this one.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Firstly, the temptation to close this case in early February 2018 should have been resisted. Within the social work assessment, concern was expressed about the mother making allegations which had not been proven and about the mother being hostile to contact between X and her father. The extraordinary statement made by the social worker that she was worried X might have an intentional bruise in the future to evidence an allegation should have been a red flag indicating the need for urgent advice and guidance around contact issues and child behaviour. Mr Watson accepted that, in hindsight, more consideration should have been afforded to the impact on the children of the mother&#8217;s behaviour/anxieties and the case should not have been closed at this point.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Second, this case emphasises the need for social workers to challenge appropriately the views and opinions of other professionals. The initial child protection conference on 10 August 2018 highlighted the need for the mother to seek a referral from her GP in order that she might have a mental health assessment. Her GP disagreed with that plan though I note that, as is sadly often the case and probably explicable by reference to his/her own considerable workload, the GP had not attended the child protection conference and thus did not have the benefit of information from all the professionals (including the police) involved with the family. It might have been helpful if the local authority had shared with the GP more information about the welter of allegations being made by the mother in June and July 2018. That process, together with respectful and appropriate professional challenge, might have resulted in a more appropriate assessment of the mother. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Third, by September 2018, the Child Protection Conference Chair believed this was a case of parental alienation. That she felt the need to highlight this issue to the allocated social worker demonstrated the complexity of the case. Mr Watson accepted those complexities should have been addressed in more depth at management level and consideration should have been given to the transfer of the case to a more experienced social worker. In any event, this was not a classic case of parental alienation. When the mother permitted contact, X did not refuse to go to her father&#8217;s home and every professional who saw her with her father noted her to be a happy little girl in his presence. That was rather different from what most often happens in cases of parental alienation, where, because of psychological manipulation by the resident parent, children are markedly and noticeably resistant to having contact, both direct and indirect, with the non-resident parent. I cannot gauge from the local authority&#8217;s case recordings whether the child protection chair was alive to the elements of this case which distinguished it from one of classic parental alienation. Whatever the label, the local authority&#8217;s management of this case in September 2018 was flawed. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Management failure probably also contributed to a divergent approach by the allocated social workers. CK appears to have had a negative view of the mother which was criticised by the nursey manager in her letter dated July 2018. The nursery manager was a professional whose staff saw the mother very frequently and who were attuned to her anxieties. Her observations about the support this anxious mother needed should have commanded considerable respect. I note that, though there was a recommendation at the child protection conference in August 2018 for mediation (as the nursery manager had recommended in her letter), the records do not show what, if any, efforts were made to access this service and what was done to encourage both the mother and AB to take part. Though WL appears, on the mother&#8217;s case, to have been a more sympathetic social worker, I doubt that this was sufficient to make good the deficits in the local authority&#8217;s strategy. Finally, Mr Watson conceded that it was a mistake to have allocated the direct work with Y to a student social worker given the complexity of what had happened by October 2018 when the work with Y began. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">What strikes me as beyond argument was the unhelpful nature of the piecemeal assessments conducted by the local authority in this case. Assessments were brief and conducted in response to allegations made by the mother. This case cried out for a comprehensive assessment of the family which might have led to a more informed understanding of both the mother&#8217;s anxieties around X&#8217;s contact with her father and her failure to promote Y&#8217;s contact with his father once that broke down in November 2017. It may also have identified at a much earlier date the need for either a psychological or a mental health assessment of the mother.    </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">However, and for the avoidance of doubt, my criticisms of the social work practice in this case does not mean that professionals were to blame for the repeated allegations made by the mother which disrupted the children&#8217;s relationship with their respective fathers. It was the mother&#8217;s erroneous beliefs which drove the making of allegations and not the responses of professionals. This mother was in search of evidence to prove that which she wrongly believed to be true and, no matter who she spoke to, the allegations aimed at AB kept coming. Even repeated attendances at court between October 2017 and May 2019 failed to modify the mother&#8217;s behaviour. The videos made of X were a truly desperate and profoundly damaging step taken by the mother in pursuit of what she believed AB to be doing to their child.   </p>
