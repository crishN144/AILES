	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2013, the London Borough of Croydon began care proceedings in relation to an infant who had been born that day. The reasons given for the application were commendably brief and encapsulate most of the issues for decision at this hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The summary relates that the parents&#8217; first born child had died in July 2011 aged 4 months. The cause of death was not identified but post mortem examination had revealed injuries to his leg and ribs which were considered to have been non accidental. It was also said that child&#8217;s father has a conviction for assault upon his oldest son and no contact with him. In relation to the mother, it was suggested that she was unable to safeguard her new baby because she was supporting the father. Police bail conditions arising out of the investigation into the injuries sustained by the child who had died did not allow either parent unsupervised contact with any child under the age of 18.</p>

Judge Atkins duly transferred the case on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March and it was before me on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March. I listed it for a combined fact finding and welfare hearing on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July by which time the baby would be 24 weeks old.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The hearing itself has been really quite remarkable firstly because of the way in which the local authority and the children&#8217;s guardian have radically altered their positions in relation to appropriate welfare orders and secondly because the exercise of making welfare decisions has been demonstrated to be comparatively simple when the individuals concerned provide oral evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When the case was opened on Tuesday of last week, the London Borough of Croydon was inviting me to make a care order predicated on a care plan of adoption. It was said that even if the mother was not involved in causing the older child&#8217;s injuries and did not know that he had suffered fractures it would nevertheless still not be safe to return the baby to her care. It did not bode well for the mother&#8217;s ability to prioritise the child&#8217;s needs over her own in the years to come, said Mr Date on behalf of the local authority, that it had taken her two years to come to a position of being able to make concessions in relation to failure to protect.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the outset of the hearing, as her written report reflects, the guardian did not support the making of a care order. Ms Dinnall recommended there should be further assessment of the maternal grandmother as a possible Special Guardian. If the mother were to be exculpated in relation to causing the injuries but found to have &#8216;failed to protect&#8217; then, said Ms Dinnall, it may have been appropriate to review the potential risks she posed and consider ongoing supervised contact.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I had always intended this would be the final part of the process, mindful of the child&#8217;s urgent need to have permanent arrangements in place at the earliest opportunity. Thus, I was dismayed to find that the maternal grandmother did not feature at all upon the witness template. In response to my disquiet, all parties agreed there was a gap and she should give evidence. Arrangements were made for the grandmother to come to court on Thursday, as an observer, and to give evidence on Friday of last week.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the conclusion of the grandmother&#8217;s evidence, Mr Date announced that the local authority had been &#8220;hugely impressed&#8221; by her; and that he would no longer be asking me to endorse a care plan for adoption. There was agreement from the local authority that the child should be placed together with his mother in the grandmother&#8217;s home. Over the weekend, that plan has crystallised to this &#8211; that a residence order should be made either to the maternal grandmother alone or jointly with the mother; and there should be a supervision order for 12 months in favour of a specified local authority in the West Midlands.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In similar vein, when Ms Dinnall went into the witness box on Friday, she relinquished her recommendation for further assessment, lending support to the suggestion that the child should be looked after by his grandmother and mother together under the auspices of a supervision order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have struggled to recall an instance where there have been quite such dramatic changes of position amongst the professionals; and whilst from the family&#8217;s perspective (particularly the mother&#8217;s and grandmother&#8217;s) those shifts were so very welcome, it must also be said that in the weeks leading up to this hearing there have been serious errors of judgment in the care planning exercise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the time of final submissions, the issues in the case distilled to only these &#8211; (i) did the parents&#8217; older son sustain non accidental injury or are the origins of his fractures, as Miss King on the father&#8217;s behalf contends, unknown? (ii) To what extent, if at all, did the mother fail to protect her first born son? (iii) Resulting from the way in which she has behaved since the discovery of that child&#8217;s injuries, should she be viewed as an individual who presents a risk to a child? (iv) Against the background of the findings made at this hearing and on an overall consideration of the child&#8217;s welfare needs, if there is to be direct contact between the child and his father what is the appropriate frequency and should it be supervised?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background essential to an understanding of the decisions to be made is this. The child at the centre of these proceedings is IA who is five and half months old. He has been living with foster parents since his discharge from hospital a few days after his birth. His mother is CP, aged 25, originally from the West Midlands. IA&#8217;s father is PA who is 26 years old; he has lived predominantly in South London. He had a previous relationship which resulted in the birth of his first child, EA, in late January 2007. </p>

The learned judge found the injury was inflicted as the result of &#8220;momentary loss of control through frustration or bad temper.&#8221; He also found that the father, on occasions, had been unable to control his temper and violent aggression towards EA&#8217;s mother; and he had, on at least one occasion, directed verbal abuse at EA.</p>

She referred herself to the local authority on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2012. There was a pre-birth assessment. The mother is recorded as saying that whilst it had been suggested she believed the father is innocent of allegations of having harmed EA and KA, &#8220;she did at some point doubt whether anything had happened in her absence which may have led to KA sustaining the injuries &#8230;. her defence of (the father) comes from the fact that she has never observed him to exhibit anger or agitation towards KA throughout their interactions.&#8221; The mother stated that &#8220;if it came down to a choice between the father and her baby, she would choose the baby.&#8221;</p>

I would be scrutinizing the parents&#8217; actions in the interim &#8211; whether they remained living together, whether they continued to be a couple. I would consider the social work and guardian&#8217;s assessments; how the parents presented in the witness box, whether either of them could be viewed as adequately protective of their child and, thus, I would decide the long term arrangements for IA.</p>

She moved out on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June but, as she and the father explained in evidence, their relationship was at an end when she decided to separate in April.

Neither the mother nor the father has to prove anything.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When considering issues of credibility, I remind myself that there are many reasons why a person in proceedings such as these might lie. They may do so for a whole host of motives. Not necessarily because they are culpable but, for example, to protect someone else; or in an attempt to bolster up a just cause, or out of shame or from a wish to conceal disgraceful behaviour from their family. The mere fact that a potential perpetrator lies is not in itself evidence of guilt. It would almost never in this situation be sufficient evidence of culpability to establish that someone had lied. It is an altogether more subtle and delicate process than that. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Professor Malcolm, (consultant histopathologist) reports, non accidental rib fractures are almost the only cause of rib fractures in immobile infants. They require the application of significant force, way beyond rough handling. Gripping or squeezing the rib cage with significant and inappropriate force is, in Professor Malcolm&#8217;s opinion, the most likely cause of KA&#8217;s rib fractures.</p>

They were about 3 to 4 days old whereas the rib fractures seemed to him to be between 4 and 8 days old. In evidence, Professor Malcolm explained that although he could not exclude the potential for overlap as to timing, his belief is that the rib fractures are older. There was no evidence of callus or bone repair in the metaphyseal fractures whereas there was bone callus in the rib fractures. Callus, he explained, &#8220;is a bit like scaffolding&#8221; and the extent of it provides an indication as to the length of the healing process.</p>

The mother had gone out shopping with a friend, visited another during the morning and then went out in the afternoon for tea with a third friend. When she returned she did not notice anything amiss but on the following day, 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, KA was &#8220;very unsettled, crying and was off his feeds.&#8221; She had taken his temperature a few times during the course of that day and thought KA might have been teething. He had been, she said in evidence, &#8220;quite moaney, grizzly, drinking but not as much as usual.&#8221; That had been the day when the father was &#8220;at probation.&#8221; The mother remembered messaging him to say she did not know what the trouble was.</p>

It is comparatively easy to contemplate circumstances in which the metaphyseal fractures occurred within the paternal grandmother&#8217;s home whilst the father and KA were alone in a particular room, so that no one saw what had happened, and whatever cries ensued could have been ascribed to any number of causes. </p>

He said in evidence, he had &#8220;kept it very sweet.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I was telling the story; I was the narrator. She (the mother) knew all I wanted her to know.

The father said in evidence that his probation officer hadn&#8217;t been &#8220;a smart chap at all&#8221;. He had been trying to protect his family so had &#8220;probably told the mother to go shopping or something&#8221; on the day of the visit.

Worryingly, he said at one point in evidence that there are a &#8220;few things (he needs) to bury&#8221; whereas in reality and very obviously, there is a pressing requirement for him to do the exact opposite &#8211; to confront his demons, deal with his anger management problems, seek out treatment for himself to address his difficulties. </p>

He holds her in high regard, credits her with bringing about positive changes in him so that he no longer &#8220;walked with certain friends, and (so he contends) became a gentle giant.&#8221; Everyone, said the father, liked the mother and saw the good she brought out in him. He has never accused her of any wrongdoing, as so often occurs in this situation; and for that he deserves some recognition.</p>

It is also suggested that she should have listened to her family members who were advising her to part from the father and that witnessing the assault upon her stepfather should have warned the mother of the father&#8217;s potential for losing control. Mr Date also contends that the mother, once pregnant with IA and knowing he would in all likelihood be removed into care, should have prioritized the baby over her relationship with the father and separated from him rather than having their relationship blessed during a ceremony on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November.</p>

She attached a copy to her letter. Although there is no mention of it with the correspondence, Ms Jacobs informs me that Dr Rylance was requested to confine his report within 10 to 12 pages. He apparently said he was content to do so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When he gave evidence, Dr Rylance confirmed he was aware of the reforms to the way in which experts are now required to report, that they should be succinct, focused and analytical and should avoid recitals of too much history and factual narrative.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Rylance&#8217;s report was 35 pages long. There was a reasonably lengthy section comprising the relevant background information (5 pages) extrapolating material from reports of other doctors and the medical records. Dr Rylance then dealt with the following issues &#8211; Timeframe for fractures; Possible / likely mechanism/ causation of rib fractures; Possible / likely mechanism / causation of right tibia metaphyseal fractures; Force to cause the fractures of the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ribs laterally; Force to cause metaphyseal fractures. He devoted about 5 pages to the issues of likely reaction at the time of and in the aftermath of injury and to whether or not a non perpetrator would have had awareness. Over the course of 5 pages, he provided advice upon the potential for there to have been a medical explanation for the rib fractures. Dr Rylance then tackled the explanations given by the parents and gave an opinion on plausibility before turning to consider (on page 25) the post mortem blood test results and their significance. He also provided an opinion as to the likely cause of the rib fractures.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">None of the foregoing was requested. Those matters did not form any part of his instruction and for the obvious reason that Professor Malcolm had already reported in relation to them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On page 27 of his report, Dr Rylance turned to consider and answer the specific questions asked of him, referring as he did so to many of his earlier paragraphs, as relevant, and repeating their content.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the 1980s and 1990s before it became the norm for experts (particularly paediatricians and psychologists) to produce absurdly lengthy reports, courts were routinely confronted with, for example, radiological reports in the form of letters which extended to about a page and a half. Professor Christine Hall at Great Ormond Street Hospitals was masterly in her ability to distil essential information and opinion within an impressively succinct report.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Her contributions to cases of this kind, and she was but one example of the then general trend in radiology, contained all the judge needed to know about the nature of the injury, mechanism, force required, likely acute and sequential symptoms, whether a proffered explanation was consistent with the injury as revealed or not. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Reports of that kind were singularly helpful. The modern way exemplified by Dr Rylance&#8217;s over-inclusive and doubtless expensive report is no longer acceptable. Experts must conform to the specifics of what is asked of them rather than, as here, provide something akin to a &#8216;paediatric overview.&#8217; I struggle to recall a single instance when such expansive and all inclusive analysis has been of real utility in a case of this kind.</p>
