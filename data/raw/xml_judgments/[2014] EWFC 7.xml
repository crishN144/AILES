The proceedings, it is distressing to record, have been going on since as long ago as 27 July 2010.  The applications currently before the court are by the father for contact to his son and by the mother for an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.</span></p>

Reports commissioned by the father were provided by DS of Ray Wyre Associates on 28 March 2011 with a more recent addendum report dated 15 January 2014.  On joint instructions, reports were commissioned from JD of Ray Wyre Associates, the original report by JD being dated 3 February 2012, with an addendum report dated 27 February 2014.</span><span/><span style="font-size:14pt">These reports were before Her Honour Judge Boye, who has had the carriage of this case since 31 October 2013, when on 10 March 2014 she made an order directing that the case be adjourned for a final hearing on 6, 7, 9 and 12 May 2014, the first day being a reading day.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Perhaps not entirely surprisingly in these seemingly unpromising circumstances, the father&#8217;s legal aid has been terminated.  The consequence of that is twofold.  First, it means that there is no available fund to meet the costs of DS attending court as an expert witness or to fund the father&#8217;s half share of the cost of JD attending court as an expert witness.  Secondly, it means that the father is unrepresented.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The father seemingly does not speak much, if any, English and is dependent upon the services of an interpreter.  I need say nothing more to indicate the obvious forensic difficulties of a hearing taking place if the father is to challenge the expert reports, as he must if he is to have any realistic prospect of avoiding the orders for which the mother contends.</span></p>

She asks for the father&#8217;s application to be dismissed forthwith, being as she puts it totally without merit and she seeks a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> order today in substance preventing the father making any application in respect of his son without the leave of the court at least until such time as the father has undertaken the work identified by DS.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I can understand why Miss Spooner makes that submission.  On the face of it, the reports are clear and compelling but, quite apart from the fact that Judge Boye was of the view that there required to be a substantial final hearing, the fact is, if one analyses the reports, that a significant part of the analysis is dependent upon the accounts given to each expert by one party or the other.  For example, the addendum report of JD addresses in paras. 6 and 7 the father&#8217;s contention that, despite his convictions in relation to sexual abuse of other children, he poses no risk of sexual harm to his own son.  In the course of analysis as to why that view is not accepted, JD founds herself in part upon the account given by the mother of the role played by the father in caring for his son, as also the mother&#8217;s account of the relationship, including the nature of the sexual relationship, between the mother and the father.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">For example, a perfectly proper line of cross-examination of JD might be along these lines, &#8220;In part at least, your analysis of the risks that the father poses to his son, as opposed to other children, is based upon the account you have had from the mother of what went on in the family home.&#8221;  It would seem, bearing in mind the language of JD&#8217;s report, that the answer could only be, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;  The next question then might be, &#8220;Suppose for the sake of argument that the true picture at home was not what the mother says but a very different picture presented by the father.  Just suppose that.  Would that affect your opinion?&#8221;  I use that only by way of illustration of a wider point that could be made in relation to these reports.  That seems to me to be a proper and appropriate line of cross-examination.  </span></p>

The answer might be, &#8220;It does not make the slightest difference at all because of X, Y, Z&#8221;, in which case the father&#8217;s case might evaporate.  It might be, &#8220;Well, yes, that might make a difference.&#8221;  The point is we simply do not know.  Despite what Miss Spooner says, I cannot have that degree of assurance that there is nothing to be said which I would have to have, bearing in mind the extreme nature of the orders being sought here, were I to proceed summarily in the way she suggests.</span></p>

It is also the obligation of the court under Articles 6 and 8 of the European Convention.  Despite what Miss Spooner says, I am left with the strong feeling that I cannot deal with the matter today justly and fairly by acceding to her submission.</span></p>

In a public law case where the proceedings are brought by a local authority, one can see a possible argument that failing all else the local authority should have to pay.  In a case such as the present where one party is publicly funded, because the mother has public funding, but the father does not, it is, I suppose, arguable that, if this is the only way of achieving a just trial, the costs of the proceedings should be thrown on the party which is in receipt of public funds.  It is arguable that, failing all else, and bearing in mind that the court is itself a public authority subject to the duty to act in a Convention compliant way, if there is no other way of achieving a just and fair hearing, then the court must itself assume the financial burden, as for example the court does in certain circumstances in funding the cost of interpreters.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I appreciate that this is a case in which, as Miss Spooner points out, there have already been too many adjournments of supposedly final hearings.  I appreciate it is a case which has been going on for the best part of four years, which is depressing to say the least.  And I am very conscious of the fact that the mere existence of the proceedings, and they must seem to the mother and her son to drag on interminably, is having a significant impact both on the mother and also on the parties&#8217; son.  Factoring that in as I do, it does seem to me that some further, but limited, delay is inescapable if I am to do justice not merely to the father but, as I have emphasised, also to the parents&#8217; son.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I shall accordingly, in terms which I will draft, adjourn this matter so that the relevant ministry can intervene if it wishes to and on the basis that if it does not I will have to decide the issues I have canvassed without that assistance.  I will reserve the matter to myself.  I will direct that the hearing takes place as soon as it possibly can after the forthcoming short vacation.  I would hope that the hearing can take place in front of me in June.</span></p>
