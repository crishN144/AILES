M&#8217;s explanation for this, when asked, was that she thought that the Doctor was asking her about previous history rather than the current situation. I don&#8217;t accept that answer.

This, of course, is consistent with the sub-standard parenting that the children were receiving up until their removal.

Given his position which evolved within this FH from seeking return of the children to actively supporting the making of care orders with plans of long-term foster care, it was neither necessary nor proportionate to litigate those findings.

I have summarised earlier in this Judgment the reasons why I refused his preliminary application to adjourn the final hearing to await the outcome of his criminal trial. As set out there, even if he were acquitted and released, in the face of a negative parenting assessment, a lack of current relationship with the children, lack of accommodation and other factors it would be far-fetched to believe that the children could be placed with him without a significant period of further delay. In any event, F&#8217;s position, which had crystalised by the end of the final hearing is actively to support the making of care orders for all of his children. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">With respect to M, her case, as developed in submissions, is that I should extend the interim care orders for all four children, on the basis that she hopes, in maybe 12 months&#8217; time, to be in a position to undergo successful reassessment with a view to a phased return of the children to her care. As set out in my summary of the reasons for dismissing F&#8217;s application, these children were in fact entitled to have permanence plans settled within 26 weeks and we are now closer to 45 weeks into these proceedings; delay is harmful to children. If there is delay it must be purposeful. Whilst M was able to acknowledge a number of things that she needed or wanted to change, including undergoing therapy, there was no clarity as to the timescales within which she might achieve many of these things.  The guardian&#8217;s evidence on this issue was, &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">I think it is hard to know at what point she would be ready for a phased return; she has identified work to me back in November that she wanted to do; there were recommendations in October for work that she has identified today and that has not started; my concern is how long do you wait for a phased plan to begin</span>&#8217;. It is telling, in my view, that 4 months on from talking to the guardian about things she wished to change, she has still not begun that process with respect to some matters, including notably the therapy that she wishes to undertake. It is said within the written evidence that M was overwhelmed by the task of caring for 4 young children; I formed the view that she remains overwhelmed by what it would take to have the children returned to her care. I cannot conclude that an open-ended extension of the interim care orders in the hope that, maybe, in around 12 months M could undergo a successful re-assessment prior to beginning a phased return of the children, is consistent with their welfare. </p>

I can confirm that as I write this part of my Judgment, I have <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1(3)</ref> of the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">CA89</span> open in front of me and have considered, in each boy&#8217;s case, the welfare checklist factors. I do not find it necessary to rehearse each of them individually. I have given particular weight, in the circumstances of this case, to the fact that both boys have suffered significant physical and emotional harm in the care of their parents &#8211; paragraph 1(3)(e). Although the parents have very belatedly conceded that, in the mother&#8217;s case, some of V&#8217;s injuries were caused through &#8216;recklessness&#8217; and in both parent&#8217;s cases, that other injuries were caused through &#8216;lack of supervision&#8217;, I am left with no reassurance that either parent has developed any real insight into <span style="font-style:italic">why</span> it is that their children suffered such an extraordinary number of minor injuries whilst living at home, nor what would be different in future. That is directly relevant to my assessment of the capability of these parents in meeting their children&#8217;s needs &#8211; para 1(3)(f). </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The local authority has indicated changes it will make to amended care plans for all of the children with respect to parental contact. Those amendments will include a commitment to explore adopters (in the case of the girls) who will consider and potentially promote direct contact with the parents; and in the case of F to set out work it will undertake, in particular with the boys, with a view to re-establishing contact, taking into account F&#8217;s circumstances as they become clearer. Neither parent challenges the local authority&#8217;s care plans, thus amended, with respect to their own contact. As I acknowledged during submissions, I found M&#8217;s concession that she would much rather prioritise sibling contact over her own contact to be child-focussed and moving. I therefore approve V and W&#8217;s care plans with respect to permanence and parental contact. I will deal with the issue of sibling contact separately below.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">My final word with respect to V and W&#8217;s care plans is that it is acknowledged by the social worker that they have settled very well in the care of their foster carer &#8216;S&#8217;. I have read a great deal about her excellent work with, and care of, these boys in the Together and Apart assessment that is filed in proceedings. SW confirmed in her evidence that S, who is an agency foster carer, has expressed a commitment to care for V and W in the long-term; she further confirmed that the LA have a policy of looking for &#8216;in house&#8217; foster carers and she has been informed that such a search will be conducted for around 6 months before the LA will consider approving S as a long-term match for V and W. SW, of course, was simply giving evidence about LA policies over which she exercises no control. She confirmed her own view, which was that it would not be in V and W&#8217;s interests to be moved from S&#8217;s care. In this regard the LA have now given a commitment that in the event they propose to remove the boys from S&#8217;s care they will fund a one-off session of legal advice for her, so that she can be advised with respect to any private law applications she might be able to make. I note in this regard that the boys will soon have been in her care for 12 months. Beyond that the LA have confirmed that they have a contractual obligation to give S 28 days&#8217; notice if they seek to terminate the placement and that obligation should be recited in the order that I make today. </p>

I therefore limit myself to these observations. It is clear that V and W have settled and thrived in the care of S and have a real attachment to her. She is a safe and nurturing environment for them. Having been removed from their mother&#8217;s care they have, I am satisfied, invested in her. The orders I am making give the LA overriding parental responsibility for V and for W. It would, in my view, be a travesty for those boys &#8211; and a dereliction of the LA&#8217;s parental responsibility towards them &#8211; if the LA removed V and W from a placement in which they are settled, safe and happy solely because of an internal policy requiring that an in-house foster carer be preferred and/or because an alternative placement costs less. </p>

The parents oppose that plan and neither consents to the making of placement orders. My task is to undertake a global, holistic evaluation of each for the options available for X and Y&#8217;s future upbringing before deciding which of those options best meets the duty to afford paramount consideration to their welfare throughout their lives. I have already dealt with the parents as options. I remind myself that I should not undertake a linear analysis whereby I discount each option in turn until the only option left is one of adoption. However, in this case neither parent says that they <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> a realistic option at this juncture in the children&#8217;s lives; F actively supports care orders for the girls and M accepts that it is likely to be at least 12 months before she could begin a phased return which would, in any event on her case, begin with the boys. For those reasons, the realistic options for X and Y are adoption and long-term foster care.</p>

It involves a carefully managed matching process to identify the right carer or carers for these children in a placement where they will feel chosen, wanted and loved. Although adoptions can and do break down, they are usually more stable placements than long-term foster care. I note, in this regard, that X and Y have already had 3 moves during their time in care. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The benefits of long-term foster care are that it is more likely than adoption, in my view, to allow the children to maintain an ongoing relationship both with their brothers and with their parents. With respect to their sibling relationship, that needs to be considered in light of my separate analysis, below, of the guardian&#8217;s invitation to make contact orders pursuant to s26(4) of the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">ACA2002</span>. However, in my view it is more likely that the girls will see their family members and, likely that they will do so more often, if they are subject to long-term foster care. I weigh in the balance that M has shown a remarkable commitment to attending contact and that the contact has generally been reported to be of a positive nature. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The major downside of adoption is that it will sever, at least to a very considerable extent, the girls&#8217; relationship with their birth family. I note that the LA is committed to finding carers who will promote direct sibling contact with V and W, although on any view that is likely to be at a considerably lower level than is currently enjoyed. This is a real downside in this particular case and I remind myself of the quite moving evidence about a recent sibling contact that had been cancelled, which caused X to be so upset that the respective carers arranged for an additional contact that weekend. Many children who are adopted suffer emotional harm in later childhood when they come to question why their life has followed that particular path. I weigh in the balance that whilst ongoing sibling contact, which the LA is committed to promoting, might mitigate that, equally it might exacerbate it as the girls question why they have been adopted whilst their brothers remain part of their birth family.</p>

As already noted, X and Y have had three moves in 10 months. Many children come to resent the ongoing need for State involvement in their day to day lives particularly when it comes to issues such as advance approval for sleepovers. There can be a stigma to the status of being a foster child. In Y&#8217;s case, if she were to be placed in long-term foster care, it would entail that she spent all but the first few weeks of her life as a foster child.</p>

I have considered each aspect of that welfare checklist. X has suffered significant emotional and physical harm in the care of her parents; Y was at risk of suffering such harm if she wasn&#8217;t removed when she was. For reasons I have already detailed in my consideration of V and W&#8217;s cases, I am of the view that both girls would be at ongoing risk of harm if they were returned to the care of either parent. I accept that there is likely to be emotional harm to both girls, X in particular given her age, of ceasing to be a member of their birth family. I weigh heavily in the balance that both girls, but X in particular, have good relationships with their brothers. Both also have a good relationship with their mother.

All parties accept and acknowledge the real bond between these siblings but in particular the bond that X has with her brothers. That is set out in a Together and Apart assessment prepared by SW which I have read with care. As I have already recorded it is a well-written and thoughtful document which gave me a real sense of the individual children and their relationships. It sets out that &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">It will be a recommendation that should a care plan of long term foster care for V and W, and adoption for X and Y be ratified, ongoing contact should be promoted. There are obvious complexities in direct contact between the siblings which would be discussed with any potential adopter</span>&#8217;. In her oral evidence under cross-examination by Ms Tappin, SW said that, for her, the right placement for the girls would be one that promoted contact with their brothers. In cross-examination by the guardian, she readily accepted that losing direct contact would be emotionally harmful for these children. Indeed, she agreed with the proposition that the sibling relationship was of fundamental importance and that she wouldn&#8217;t be in support of a placement that didn&#8217;t promote a level of direct ongoing contact between the children. </p>

The guardian&#8217;s concern is rather that SW. for a variety of reasons, may not remain involved in decision making for the children and, moreover, even if she does, may not have the final say in decisions for the children within the local authority. I have already set out how impressed I was by SW&#8217;s evidence, and I also have no doubt about her genuine commitment to these children and to ensuring that they continue to see each other. </p>

The LA&#8217;s concern is that making an order which requires any prospective adopter to allow direct contact post-placement might restrict the pool of potential adopters. I accept that submission. If an order for contact is going to have any effect it can only be to narrow the potential pool of adopters. That said, I also take into consideration that prospective adopters are now routinely trained and educated on the potential value of ongoing direct contact between adopted children and birth family members. Indeed, the agency with which the LA engages, One Adoption, have this as an expectation of approving potential adopters. </p>

I have weighed in the balance that that might lead to further delay for these children and might, in line with the local authority&#8217;s care plans, lead to a situation where in 12 months&#8217; time it has to consider whether a plan of adoption for both girls together, remains the right plan. That will inevitably bring into focus whether the girls should be separated. In that regard, I also weigh in the balance the social worker&#8217;s written evidence with respect to the closeness of X and Y&#8217;s relationship and her oral evidence that this is only likely to increase over the course of the next year; to that extent it may be less likely that the LA will conclude that they should be separated even if a plan of adoption for both of them together cannot be achieved.

The guardian says that the reduction to the eventual level of post-placement contact should be done gradually. The LA agree with that however they say that, if I make orders for sibling contact, rather than the court prescribing now how any reduction should be effected, it should be left to the discretion of the LA social care team in light of the circumstances as they exist at the time. Indeed, in that regard, I note that the LA&#8217;s own proposal is that direct contact should be &#8216;at least twice a year&#8217; and so it would be difficult to prescribe a reduction plan in circumstances where the endpoint remains uncertain.</p>

The order I make is that following the making of the placement order the sibling contact will reduce to a level of once monthly, in line with the existing care plans for the children which set out a phased reduction to that level. Following X and Y being placed for adoption with a matched potential adopter or adopters, that direct contact will reduce to a level of at least twice a year but the actual level (so long as it is at least twice per year) and the manner in which the reduction is to be achieved are subject to further planning and agreement between the local authority/adoption agency and prospective adopters.</p>
