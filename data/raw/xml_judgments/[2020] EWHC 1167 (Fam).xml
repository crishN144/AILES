	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in"><span style="font-style:italic">The Appeal: </span>On 15 November 2018 Mr K (&#8220;the father&#8221;) issued a notice of appeal against the decision of District Judge Greensmith (now His Honour Judge Greensmith) dated 28 May 2015. The District Judge made a finding that the father had sexually abused his daughter, the child, D, born in 2009.  On account of the substantial delay in pursuing this appeal, the father also applies for relief from sanctions and for permission to appeal out of time. His application is opposed by the child&#8217;s mother, Ms E (&#8220;the mother&#8221;).  It is obvious from this minimal chronology that this is a very stale appeal indeed and that exceptional circumstances would have to pertain for the court to contemplate granting permission.  The child is represented by her Guardian, who fully supports the granting of permission to appeal out of time and allowing the appeal. </p>

The delay in this case is wholly exceptional and nothing in this Judgment is intended to alter the clear and long established principles relating to relief from sanctions and appealing out of time. I have decided, however, that the District Judge&#8217;s findings are so unsafe and their consequences so serious that I cannot allow them to stand. </p>

Mr Taylor&#8217;s lengthy and comprehensive written and oral submissions concentrated heavily on what I referred to as the &#8220;micro&#8221; issues, as well as the &#8220;macro&#8221; ones. As I pointed out to him during the course of the hearing, the central issue in this appeal has been to consider the </p>

For his part, and incorrectly in my judgement, Mr Taylor criticised Mr Tyler, for the Guardian, for not paying enough attention to the micro issues.  In so doing, and with respect to Mr Taylor&#8217;s comprehensive mastery of the facts, he misunderstood his task by concentrating on the detailed analysis of the evidence.  My task has been to concentrate on the errors in the Judgment that the father alleges.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The mother and father, both British citizens, met abroad in 2008 and continued their relationship when they returned to the UK later that year. The child D was born in 2009 and is now 10 years old. The relationship between the parents was short-lived and they separated in January 2010, just weeks after D was born. In March 2010 the father instructed solicitors, as the parents were unfortunately unable to agree arrangements in respect of D. The mother objected to contact, alleging that the father was abusive, aggressive and unable to care for a young child. The father says that the mother declined mediation and so he issued Children Act proceedings during the course of 2010.  It is important that I stress that it has not been my task during this appeal to consider where the truth lies between the different accounts respectively given by the mother and the father. </p>

A lot of consternation followed, which resulted in an incident in May 2011 when the police were called to the maternal family home, the maternal family apparently refusing to make D available for contact. There was a further court hearing in August 2011 when further contact was directed. In 2012 there was a hearing before the lay justices when a final order was made for overnight staying contact on alternate weekends, increasing as D reaches 3 to 4 years of age. The father says that the mother remained highly resistant to contact.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Later that month, the mother relocated despite the father&#8217;s opposition to any reduction in contact. In December 2013 (and this was not known to the father nor to the District Judge at the time of the fact-finding hearing) the mother contacted the health visitor and provided a report that D was the victim of sexual abuse by her father. It is an unfortunate feature of this case that a great deal of documentation has only recently been disclosed. For example, in June 2019 the father and his advisers saw, for the first time, what purported to be a typed diary document received from the police back in 2013/2014. It appears to have been prepared by various maternal family members and is said by the father&#8217;s advisers to contradict handwritten entries before the court in 2014.  The Guardian told me through Mr Tyler, and I accept, that the disclosure of the new material had a significant impact on the Guardian&#8217;s decision to support this appeal.  Although now is unlikely to be the correct time, it seems to me that an enquiry must follow at some stage as to how it was that essential material was not produced until years after the hearing under appeal.  The late production of important material has been a hideous interference with the progress of justice in this case.  The financial cost is immense and the human cost incalculable. </p>

She added her recommendation that contact between D and the father should be promoted.

The stated reason for this was that the father was unable to continue to afford legal representation. I am not clear whether the District Judge failed to respond to the letter or whether he responded negatively but, in any event, what is clear, and agreed, is that the father&#8217;s solicitor attended on the first day of the listed fact find/final hearing, 27 May 2015. The solicitor asked for permission to withdraw the father&#8217;s application to enforce the contact order of 2012. The application was unsuccessful and the District Judge determined that the hearing should continue. Given the outstanding factual issues I do not criticise the District Judge for declining the father&#8217;s invitation.

(For the purposes of the present application, the father has provided an expert report dated 28 October 2018 confirming the diagnosis of dyslexia.)

I have to say that I find  this to be a remarkable prospect. Whilst, of course, the mother&#8217;s counsel was entitled to, and properly did, cross-examine the instructed expert, it is difficult to understand how the mother&#8217;s counsel could have cross-examined on behalf of the father. The mother was asserting that the father had sexually abused D. The father was vehemently resisting and defending that allegation. Their positions could not have been more opposite. It was open to the District Judge to adjourn so that a special advocate, or an amicus to the court, could have been instructed. The District Judge could have put questions himself. He could have discussed the questions in advance.  I do not think that it could ever be right in such circumstances to expect counsel for the opposing party to cross-examine in the way that was suggested.  The father&#8217;s solicitor, before he left, said to the District Judge, &#8220;but he would have to put a case that is expressly contrary to his instructions&#8221;, in response to the suggestion that the mother&#8217;s counsel conduct cross-examination for the father.

He says that there is a real risk of &#8220;opening the floodgates&#8221; and that the time limit would be so nugatory that no litigant would be able to feel secure in the outcome of any case, even years afterwards.

In other words, says Mr Taylor, the father got the order that he wanted, which is that no provisions have been made for him to see or spend time with D. In answer to this, unsurprisingly, the father asserts that there is a gulf of difference between his withdrawing his application for a Child Arrangements Order and the District Judge making a positive finding of fact that this father sexually assaulted his daughter. I agree that there is a gulf of difference between these two events and it is necessary for me to take some time to examine the reasons for the father&#8217;s significant and, on the face of it, unacceptable delay. </p>

This has been helpfully condensed by the father&#8217;s legal team into a document entitled &#8220;chronology as to delay&#8221;. The father asserts, and I am prepared to accept, that between May 2015 and May 2016 he made repeated telephone calls to his former solicitors seeking advice on appeal. I am told that, on 1 June 2015, i.e. only three days after the Judgment, the father&#8217;s partner began preparations for cancer treatment later that month at a hospital. Between 18 and 21 June she engaged in further preparation for treatment and, on 22 June, she was admitted for treatment for cancer which had by then spread. It was during the middle of this phase, namely on 18 June, that the time limit for lodging the notice of appeal expired. I was provided with his partner&#8217;s medical records, and accept for the purposes of this appeal without making any findings, that between the beginning of June 2015 and, at least, the end of 2018, the father&#8217;s partner was undergoing significant and invasive treatment in respect of cancer. </p>

The father responded by saying &#8220;time is against us so the sooner we can get the ball rolling the better chance we have&#8221;. On 13 October the solicitor e-mailed counsel&#8217;s clerk asking for a quote for and advice on appeal. The father chased on 28 November and then in December the father attended at his solicitor&#8217;s offices asking for an update, to be told that they were still waiting to hear from Counsel&#8217;s clerk. The evidence shows that, on 15 December, the solicitor chased counsel&#8217;s clerk again. Things seem at this stage to have gone quiet, albeit that the father&#8217;s partner was attending treatment for cancer. Eventually, on 13 March 2017, the father e-mailed the solicitor asking for an update and complaining about the delay. The father e-mailed again on 23 March. It was not until 8 June 2017 that the solicitors emailed the father informing him that they had contacted counsel&#8217;s clerks in October 2016 and December 2016 and that they would chase again. Eventually, on 21 June 2017, the father e-mailed his solicitors to say that he did want to continue and invited the solicitors to keep chasing &#8220;because this is really important to me and my family&#8221;. Thereafter, the father appears not to have heard further from these solicitors. </p>

However, it is clear to me that the account given by the father is probably correct and it seems that he was probably very badly let down by this firm of solicitors. Of course, the mother fairly levels criticism at the father saying that he should have sought alternative representation or chased further. I agree in significant respects, but I have to balance the criticisms made by the mother of the father against the circumstances in which the father found himself. He, probably like the mother, was unused to dealing with lawyers and the legal process. He was having to support his partner through what must have been very harrowing cancer treatment.   </p>

To date, there is no effect on the mother. Of course, if I give permission to appeal then the mother potentially is gravely affected by that decision, and of course I recognise that years of delay will have profoundly impacted on her as well. The failure to comply could, of course, also mean that the father has been incorrectly found to be a sexual abuser of his own daughter and his daughter may be growing up incorrectly believing her father to be a sexual abuser.  If my analysis of the District Judge&#8217;s findings leads me to conclude that his findings are unsafe, then the effect of failure to comply has been profound indeed, and, exceptionally, this may lead to the need for a re-hearing, however late in time that re-hearing is. </p>

If I have to balance evils, it is my judgement that, should it be the case after a further fact finding hearing, it is better for D to be informed then that her father did not abuse her, than to spend the rest of her life believing that he did. I repeat here what I have already said above, that I am not making findings as to whether the father did, or did not, abuse D.  The decisions about D which will need to be taken in the new fact-find hearing reaches a different conclusion will, of course, be a matter for the Judge who conducts that hearing. </p>

To allow delay to unsettle a long established status quo should usually be avoided, but to permit to persist a (possibly) false premise on which a child&#8217;s welfare is determined will almost certainly be detrimental to that child.  </p>

That danger has been recognised in a number of cases in which the court has emphasised the discrete roles of the expert and the court. In the case of the voracity expert, the danger is particularly acute. The ultimate judge of the voracity, i.e. where the truth lies, is the judge and the judge alone. He cannot delegate that decision to any expert. I acknowledge that a child psychiatrist&#8230;.may be able to point out some features of a child&#8217;s account that add or detract from authenticity&#8230; But in my experience, many of these features should be obvious to judges in any event.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It is important to remind myself that, on 20 June 2014, the District Judge made 19 findings of fact establishing a long course of conduct in D, comprising both comments about her father and instances and patterns of concerning and sexualised behaviour. The District Judge did not, however, consider the evidence sufficiently cogent to make findings that D&#8217;s father had sexually abused her. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">District Judge&#8217;s initial findings. Dr G said, &#8220;I am mindful that DJ Greensmith has made findings of fact in respect of 19 of the 20 allegations detailed in the Scott schedule, effectively meaning that these allegations can now be regarded as disclosures&#8221;.  Dr G was plainly wrong in saying this. The District Judge found the fact that D had said the things attributed to her and behaved in the way described by others; he did not find that D&#8217;s allegations had been true, nor that her behaviour represented the sequelae of proved sexual abuse. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The Guardian asserts through Mr Tyler that Dr G was also plainly wrong when he said, &#8220;from my perspective, I can identify four likely risks to D if direct contact between her and her father is resumed. The first being the continued risk of him repeating his past actions toward D, as described by her to her mother and maternal grandparents and found as a fact in the Judgment of DJ Greensmith&#8221;. By letter dated 16 March 2015, Dr G was asked about these mistakes and responded on 20 April 2015, saying that his &#8220;understanding of the Judgment is consistent with that outlined in the above two bullet points&#8221; (i.e. an accurate description of the findings).  Dr G went on to say that he would &#8220;respectfully suggest the court that my psychological assessment of D may have offered further opinion of direct relevance to the question of whether her father was indeed the perpetrator of sexual abuse on D&#8221;.  He concluded by considering that &#8220;I think it is highly unlikely that there is an alternative explanation for the disclosures made by D and/or her behaviour&#8221;. </p>

No mention was made of these issues by the District Judge in his Judgment. Indeed, the District Judge said: </p>

I need at this point to pause to explain the significance of expert evidence, especially to Mr K, so that he can understand the manner in which the evidence is approached. I say that because Mr K, who I remind myself as a litigant in person, has made a submission that he should not be judged on opinion evidence. I need to emphasise that Dr G is an expert witness and as an expert witness he&#8217;s entitled to, indeed he is required to, express an opinion and I am required to take note of his opinion and can only depart from his opinion if I have a good reason for doing so.&#8221;  </p>

As stated previously, for the court to depart from the advice of an expert court has to have a good reason for doing so. I can find no reason at all to depart from the opinion of Dr G and agree with his conclusions. The disclosures that D has made are of an adult nature. It is, in my judgement, impossible for a child of her age to fantasise to the extent of making the disclosures she has made to her mother. Quite simply the evidence which the court has before the court of Dr G and which is accepted by the court is the cogent evidence which was lacking in June.&#8221;  </p>

Moreover, the father had not prepared any cross-examination of Dr G and was given very little time in the deed to do so. Had Dr G&#8217;s evidence been less central, the District Judge&#8217;s approach may have adequately met the competing factors due for consideration when applying the overriding objective to achieve a fair result. However, in my judgement, the procedure adopted was irregular to a degree which caused injustice within the meaning of part 30, FPR 2010. No evidence was heard in relation to various key matters, for example the fundamental misapprehension as to the findings made.  No challenge was made in relation to the limitations of the role of the veracity expert and no exploration was made as to possible other reasons for D&#8217;s presentation with the expert, for example alienation. </p>
