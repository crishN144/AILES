Therefore, PB&#8217;s application for a reconsideration of the court order issued on 5 September 2014 limiting the registration of the EPA to JW only, should be dismissed.</p>

Although PB has admitted to having RG&#8217;s income paid into his own account to help cover the costs of RG&#8217;s care fees, the household bills for the property they both jointly own and the mortgage in RG&#8217;s own name, it is difficult to confirm whether PB has not benefited financially from this, where his personal interests conflict with his duties as an attorney. PB has admitted to creating a credit card debt using RG&#8217;s finances for his own personal use, which he claims to have received permission from RG to use. This has resulted in a debt being incurred in the estate of RG. PB also failed to clear the credit card debt in RG&#8217;s name which he has created.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Secondly, I must return to that line of authorities on the &#8216;unsuitability&#8217; of an attorney acting under an EPA. In the first of these cases, <span style="font-style:italic">In re W (Enduring Power of Attorney)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 3 WLR 45" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 3 WLR 45</ref>, Jules Sher QC considered the concept of unsuitability in the context of hostility between various members of the donor&#8217;s family, as is unfortunately the case here. At pages 51 and 52 he said as follows:</p>

		    <p class="BlockText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8220;The second ground of unsuitability is the hostility between the three children. The Master concluded that that fact alone rendered any one of them unsuitable to be Mrs. W&#8217;s attorney. In my judgment such hostility may well have such consequences but it all depends upon the circumstances. For example, had the estate of Mrs. W been complex and had it required strategic decisions in relation to its administration, one would expect the attorney to have had to consult and work with her siblings in relation to the administration. In such circumstances the evident hostility between them would impact adversely on the stewardship of the attorney, no matter who was at fault in creating the hostility in the first place.</span></p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.25in"><span style="font-size:12pt">But in this case the estate is simple. &#8230; In other words there is nothing of any significance left to be done. The assets are under proper control. The income simply needs to be fed through to the nursing home. The evidence is that this has been done by Mrs. X very efficiently. She has indicated more than once that she has never intended to charge for her services under the power of attorney and she does not intend to do so. Against this, if the Public Trustee were to come in, there would be an appointment fee and an annual fee of between &#163;2,350 and &#163;3,600 per annum. If a solicitor were appointed the total cost would be likely to be somewhat less than that.</span></p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.25in"><span style="font-size:12pt">It seems to me that it is not right to say that (irrespective of the background) hostility of the kind we have seen in this case between the children renders any one of them unsuitable to be Mrs. W&#8217;s attorney. In this case the hostility will not impact adversely on the administration. It would, in my judgment, be quite wrong to frustrate Mrs. W&#8217;s choice of attorney in this way. Whether it is or is not a good idea for a parent in Mrs. W&#8217;s position, when such hostility exists, to appoint one child alone as attorney is another question. But Mrs. W did so and, on the evidence, did so knowing of the hostility. That is her prerogative and in my judgment, when the hostility does not interfere with the smooth running of the administration, the court should not interfere of the ground of unsuitability.&#8221;</span></p>
