Z&#8217;s parents have nothing with which to reproach themselves. They have done everything possible for Z, but the sad reality is that Z is, both as a matter of ordinary language and within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref>(b)(ii) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, &#8220;beyond parental control.&#8221; Accordingly, and very properly, the final care order which I made on 12 April 2018 recited the parents&#8217; acceptance that:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The care proceedings in relation to Z were begun in the Family Court at Coventry. It had become apparent that what Z needed &#8211; and needed desperately &#8211; was help and treatment in a clinical, therapeutic setting. Frustrated in their endeavours to achieve that outcome, the Local Authority commenced the care proceedings in June 2017. By December 2017, when Z unexpectedly had to leave (I emphasise for reasons having nothing to do with Z) what was proving to be a supportive placement at AA, there was a general consensus that what Z needed &#8211; and needed very desperately &#8211; was a placement in a low secure unit (LSU). But Z was returned, in accordance with the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>, to AB. Few thought AB a suitable placement for Z; for Z had previously been placed at AB (which was not a SLU) and had not benefited from the regime there: see paragraph 17 below. So, this move to AB would almost inevitably necessitate a further move for Z. On 6 December 2017 the Local Authority was notified that <span style="font-style:italic">there were no LSU beds in the United Kingdom that would accept Z. </span>The matter was brought before Her Honour Judge Watson on 8 December 2017. She directed the attendance of the NHS England Commissioning Board (NHSE) at a further hearing listed before His Honour Judge Cleary on 18 December 2017. </p>

The local authority&#8217;s final care plan, dated 12 April 2018 and incorporating various amendments agreed at court that day, addressed this reality. Accordingly, there were two fundamental components to the care plan:</p>

In this context I remind the local authority of what I said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X (A Child) (No 5)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/2141" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 2141 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 2141 (Fam)</ref>, para 9:</p>

So, the local authority will remain under a duty to this very vulnerable young woman even after her 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday. Given her age, it is very important that the &#8216;leaving care&#8217; planning for X begins immediately. This is a matter to which the guardian rightly drew attention. It is critically important.&#8221;</p>

Her report makes for saddening and depressing reading. Supported by much detail which there is no need for me to recite, and which it would be wholly inappropriate to disclose, her report includes the following:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is my view that this is not a case whereby parents have failed to recognise and act upon their child&#8217;s needs but a case of [Z] being failed by support services, namely the NHS/CAMHS.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8230; My strong view is that this is a family and indeed a child who have been extremely let down by services who are supposed to support a family and a child with such needs. It is also clear &#8230; that [Z&#8217;s parents] were desperate for support and requested this appropriately. I can see that the Local Authority have tried their very best to assist but the bottom line is that this is a case whereby the National Health Service and/or Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service should and could have provided more support, assistance and treatment to [Z] throughout [Z&#8217;s] childhood.&#8221;</p>

Although the Local Authority were trying their best to support [Z], the NHS/ CAMHS continued to say that [Z] did not meet the criteria for assessment and/or appropriate treatment. By &#8230; self-harming at &#8230; , it forced the NHS&#8217; hand to assess [Z] and [Z] was Sectioned under the Mental Health Act &#8230; </p>

As [Z]&#8217;s Guardian, I was extremely concerned by this, as it was my view that this was deprivation of &#8230; liberty without meaningful treatment.</p>

At that time, there was still no treatment plan available and [Z] was without a key worker &#8230; it had a very detrimental impact upon [Z&#8217;] general wellbeing, as well as exacerbating [Z&#8217;s] mental health issues even further. Again, there was a complete lack of recognition of the impact of this upon [Z] who was not even included in any care planning regarding &#8230; hospital admission or the treatment/care plan. On 21/07/2017 Mr Justice Keehan&#8217;s comments about this situation was that it was not helpful or sensitive to [Z&#8217;s] needs and he urged the Local Authority to make a complaint about the treatment [Z] had received from the hospital at that point and due to the general lack of communication between them and the Local Authority and parents.</p>

It was all very vague and confusing with different doctors offering different opinions with the consensus being that [Z&#8217;s] behaviour was too much to manage in a low secure but &#8230; not criminal or against others so [Z] did not meet the criteria for a medium secure unit &#8230; [the move to AA] &#8230; On 11/12/2017 [Z] was moved [to AB].</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The history of this case is that CAMHS will undertake an assessment but then say that [Z] does not meet the criteria or if [Z] does they will not provide a service because [Z] moves to a different placement because of &#8230; mental health difficulties. There has been no follow-on service and no consistency for [Z], even when in hospital; [Z] has been moved around with no consideration for &#8230; stability, consistency or welfare. At points along the way we have had a chicken and egg situation &#8211; [Z] needs treatment but cannot access it because of &#8230; self-harming behaviour, but does [Z] behave in this way because [Z] needs the treatment? There has just been a catalogue of [Z&#8217;s] needs not being identified and met, which I strongly feel has led to this current situation.&#8221;</p>
