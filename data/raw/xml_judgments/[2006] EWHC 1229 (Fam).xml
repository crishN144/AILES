However, it was either just over or somewhat under five years ago.  They have been living here at an address unknown to the father who discovered their whereabouts by finding on the internet a report relating to bullying at school in which A was cited as an example, having been the victim of a violent &#8220;happy slapping&#8221; incident which received substantial publicity.</p>

The mother had a young daughter by a previous marriage, R, who was adopted by the father shortly before the birth of A.  A was born in Jacksonville and is herself an American citizen.  The father has now remarried and has three young children of his present marriage (2 children of his new wife by her former marriage and a child of his by another relationship).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties last lived together in Michigan and separated in 1998 after a turbulent marriage.  It seems clear that the father frequently used violence towards the wife.  Prior to their divorce in May 1999, in the course of individual counselling sessions following reference by the court to its Family Counselling and Mediation Division, R complained of sexual abuse by the father over a period of some four years, as well as persistent use of violence against her.  Upon divorce, the Michigan Court awarded sole physical and legal custody of A and R to the mother, providing for supervised parenting time on the part of the father in Florida where the mother was now living with the maternal grandmother.  Following investigation of R&#8217;s complaint, the police decided not to pursue charges and the Michigan Court removed the requirement for supervision of the father&#8217;s contact.  At a hearing which the mother did not attend, an order was made giving the father general visitation rights in Florida and unsupervised contact during the children&#8217;s school vacations.</p>

She asserts, and  I accept, that she and A left Florida and flew to England on 14 December 2000 where her new husband lived., She accepts that this was done without the knowledge or consent of the father or the approval of the court and that, at the time, there was current  a dispute over the father&#8217;s contact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The hearing before me began with a concession by the mother&#8217;s counsel that, for the purposes of Article 3 of the Convention, the evidence deduced by the father established a wrongful removal, not because he could establish any breach of his own rights of custody (at the time of the removal of A in December 2000 the mother was the beneficiary of a court order giving her sole custody rights) but because there was extant a provision in that order that the children should not be removed from the State of Florida without the approval of the judge who awarded custody.  In such a case, as the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Child Abduction: Right&#8217;s of Custody)</span>[2000] AC 291 made clear, removal in the face of such an order is a breach of the foreign court&#8217;s right of custody and sufficient to establish breach of Article 3.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nonetheless, the original basis on which the father asserted his right to proceed deserves highlighting because, as is now apparent on the evidence before me, it involved invocation of this court&#8217;s jurisdiction on a false basis calculated to assist his case which does the father no credit and, indeed, causes me to view his credibility with the utmost circumspection where it clashes with the assertions of the mother or A.  In paragraphs 30-32 of his affidavit, the father puts forward a circumstantial account of events calculated to make clear that the mother was still in Florida in 2001 and was aware of the courts orders made in 2001 (in fact obtained in her absence) and that, in the face of the October 2001 order, she made deceitful arrangements with him to hand over A with which she did not comply, instead removing A to England in breach of the father&#8217;s custody rights.</p>

I record that Mr Scott-Manderson for the father obtained instructions from the father  over the telephone that the newspaper article was &#8220;inaccurate&#8221;, but its form and content do not suggest room for error and, on the evidence before me, I reject the father&#8217;s evidence to the timing and circumstances of the mother&#8217;s departure to England.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not propose to give more than a brief summary of the evidence of the mother and father.  In her statement of 31 March 2006, the mother complains of violence during the marriage and exhibits documentation evidencing R&#8217;s complaints, the mother&#8217;s own complaints of violence to the police, and a revealing report of the Family Counselling and Mediation Division of the Michigan Court to which I have already referred.  That report was only a few months after the break-up of the marriage.  It refers to the marital conflicts as recounted by the parties at the time.  It makes clear that the mother had been experiencing mental health problems which the husband did not understand and with which he did not co-operate.  It refers to a marriage of &#8220;continuous conflict, chaos, and confusion [which] resulted in the minor children&#8217;s psychological, emotional, and physical well-being, being at risk&#8221;.  It reported that, while the mother was sad and very emotional during the interview process, she regained her composure when discussing her involvement with a support organisation called First Step, which had had a positive impact on her ability to cope and function.  It had strengthened her self worth and ability to care appropriately for and protect the children from further harm.  The report stated that, by the time of the report, the mother had &#8220;demonstrated the ability to make sound decisions, obtain effective support, and protect her children.&#8221;  It reported A, at the age of 6, as having accepted that her parents lived separate lives, and as being &#8220;age-appropriate yet struggling with emotional and psychological needs.&#8221;  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the light of the suggestion in these proceedings that A&#8217;s statements to the CAFCASS reporter may be based on suggestions from her mother rather than from her own memory, it is important to record the position set out in the contemporary mediation report, namely that A &#8220;was animated and responsive to inquiries&#8221; and spoke of &#8220;continuous verbal abuse and domestic violence&#8221;.  While she stated that she was not fearful of her father, she only wanted to visit him if her big sister was present.  A report by First Step of 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 1999 makes clear that A then stated that she had witnessed the father physically abusing the mother and both R and A were fearful and mistrustful of their father.  Both spoke of several harmful threats made by the father towards the mother but reported that their level of fear had decreased since moving away from Michigan to Florida.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother states that her departure for England with A was as a result of the re-establishment by the court of unsupervised contact for the father and renewed expressions of intention by him, in circumstances where she could not afford the fees of an Attorney and a variety of threats by the father.  She went with her new husband to his hometown in England despite diffidence at the prospect of life here.  Soon afterwards her new husband deserted her by returning to the USA, ostensibly to fetch R who had remained behind, but did not contact her again.  R came to England by herself.  Since that time the mother has lived in the same town with A, where R is also resident and now married.  The mother has established a small business in the form of a shop selling somewhat eccentric items.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother records bullying and hostility to A from groups of unsupervised children in the community, which culminated in an incident of violence in October 2004 recorded in the media.  She makes clear that A now has the assistance of therapeutic and counselling services and has developed her own personal strategies for dealing with any bullying should it arise again in future.  She states that A has developed into a young woman with likes and dislikes of her own, opinions and firm friendships amongst her own age group and with the staff at her school where she is now happy and well settled.  She is happy and integrated into her home life together in England where she feels secure save for recent worries that her father may come and remove her.  A has made it clear to her that she does not wish to return to America and will not go.  </p>

He also denies sexual abuse of R and asserts in general terms that such abuse has been &#8220;the constant theme of [the mother&#8217;s] false allegations&#8221; against him.  He asserts that the mother was frequently verbally and physically violent towards R, and that the mother had mental health problems which led to his taking on the role of both mother and father for R and A.  </p>

A is a troubled teenager who was plainly fearful of return there.  She had expressed very strong views, and said that she would rather sleep on the streets (of England) than return to America.  Given that in the previous year she had shown a willingness to run away when in disagreement with her mother over an older boyfriend, Ms Oliver was concerned that she might run away again if ordered to return to America against her will.  </p>

Thus the approach is not simply to disregard a period of concealment, subtracting it from the total period of delay in order to calculate whether 12-month period has been exceeded; the court must look critically at any alleged settlement that is built on concealment and deceit, especially if the abducting parent is a fugitive from criminal justice.  Thorpe LJ went on to emphasise at para [62] that, even if settlement is established on the facts, the court nonetheless retains a residual discretion to order return under Article 18 of the Hague Convention.</p>

Obviously the present case  illustrates the possibility that the considerable turpitude of the mother&#8217;s conduct will be out weighed by the quality of the false environment and the years of history that it has achieved.  It is, of course, an injustice to the deprived father that the longer the deprivation extends the less his prospect of achieving a return.  The other side of the same coin is that the longer the mother persists in her deceit the more likely she is to hold her advantage.  Not only does she increase her chances of resisting an application for a return order, but she also complicates the process or reintroducing the father into the child&#8217;s life and reduces the prospect of ever restoring the relationship that might have been between father and daughter but for the lost years.&#8221;</p>

It is particularly alert not to allow abducting parents to gain advantage for themselves by wrongful actions in removing the child.  Yet Art 12(2) provides an instance in which an order for return is not an automatic response.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear from the evidence put before me that, so far as the necessary physical element of settlement is concerned, i.e. that of being established in the community and a new environment is satisfied.  This is not a case where the mother and A have, as it were, gone from place to place as fugitives of justice.  They have simply gone and settled in the area where the mother&#8217;s third husband originated and where her older daughter now lives, having married &#8220;a local&#8221;; besides that proximity, they have also integrated into a small community of supportive friends and relatives by marriage.  While it is plain that A has had a history of trouble from persistent bullying by and a number of emotional disturbances, neither factor goes to the question whether or not she is physically settled into the community in which she has lived for 5 years.  I find that she is so settled.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">While I accept that those factors require attention when considering the emotional and psychological elements of settlement, the fact that a child or teenager is &#8220;unsettled&#8221; in her own emotional or psychological state, does not, in my view demonstrate that she is not well settled for the purposes of the Convention in the place she resides, has an established family life, and intends to remain since, as made clear above, the place of settlement means the community or environment in which the child is now living.  She has been living in the same community for some 5 years where she has a home.  In this respect, she is not only living where other members of her family live, she has attended several schools within the area and is now happy and making progress at her most recent school (see the letter referred to at para 43 above).  She is well established in a circle of friends and supporters and her activities are all centred in the same community.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as the future is concerned, the only question mark hanging over the continued residence of A and her mother where they presently are, is their immigration status.  They are plainly subject in principle to a threat of deportation.  However, it is clear that they have not been given any warning or notice to that effect, despite the fact that their position is well known to the Home Office, and I have been told that an application by the mother for leave to remain is still pending.  Mr. Scott Manderson submits that the evidence to which I have been referred cannot be regarded as establishing settlement for the purposes of the Convention, given the uncertainty of the position.  I note that, in this regard, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re L (Abduction:  Pending Criminal Proceedings) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 FLR 433" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 FLR 433</ref> Wilson J observed at para [24]</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Cases fall to be decided on their particular facts.  In this case there is no question of extradition proceedings and it appears that the Home Office have been well aware of the position of the mother and her wish to remain since 8 August 2003 and have done nothing in that regard.  This is not a case where the mother arrived, or has since moved about, as a fugitive from justice; nor does it appear that she has done anything to avoid the attention of the Home Office.  In those circumstances, I do not consider that I should assume that it is likely that A or her mother will be deported in the near future and in my view settlement within the meaning of Article 12 of the Convention is established.  </p>

I do not consider that I should.  I have regard to, and bear well in mind the purposes of the Hague Convention.  As in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re C, </span>I consider that the position has been reached whereby the court in Michigan or Florida is no longer in a noticeably better position than an English court to decide welfare questions concerning the child, given that the difficult events which have shaped her young life over the past 5 years and which govern her present welfare needs have all taken place here.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In assessing the degree of the mother&#8217;s wrongdoing and the injustice to the father, there is of course no doubt that she must have realised she was in breach of the order of the Michigan Court in proceeding to England without obtaining court permission.  However, it appears the mother was under considerable mental stress at the time and in a situation where R had complained of sexual abuse by the father, albeit the police considered that there was insufficient evidence on which to act.  That did not excuse  the mother&#8217;s wrongdoing, or the injustice to the father in denying him contact with the children in the face of a court order.  However, it goes some way to explain her conduct it in a manner which is not wholly discreditable to the mother.  However my principal concern, like that of Ms. Oliver, arises on welfare grounds and is directed to the effect upon S of ordering a return to the United States after 5 years in this country.  Not only would it be to uproot her in her vulnerable early teenage years; it would be to destroy the emotional and educational stability now within her grasp after a sustained effort by family, friends and counsellors to that end.  I would therefore decline to exercise my discretion to order her return.  </p>

I consider I have insufficient evidence on that question to find such defence established.  However, in the  light of the conclusion I have reached in relation to A&#8217;s objections to returning to the United States, it is unnecessary for me to say more in this respect.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It has been conceded by Mr. Scott Manderson that, on the evidence before the court, it is clear that A has attained an age and maturity where it is appropriate to take account of her views.  However, he has submitted that this is a case where nonetheless discretion should be exercised to order the return of A to the jurisdiction of the Florida Court.  In this connection he has urged me, as I do, to take into account, as I do, of the policy of the Convention as set out at paras [16 &#8211; 19] of the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Zaffino v Zaffino (Abduction:  Children&#8217;s Views)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2005/1012" uk:canonical="[2005] EWCA Civ 1012" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWCA Civ 1012</ref> [2006 1 FLR 410 in which Thorpe LJ approved and emphasised the observations of Balcombe LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re R (Child Abduction: Acquiescence) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 1 FLR 716" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 1 FLR 716</ref> to the effect, that in normal circumstances, it is to be considered in the best interests of children generally that they should be promptly returned to the country whence they have been wrongfully removed and that it is only in exceptional cases that the court should have a discretion to refuse to order an immediate return.  Thus it is that, if the court should come to the conclusion that the child&#8217;s views have been influenced by some other person such as the abducting parent, or that the objection to return is simply because of a wish or preference to remain with the abducting parent, then little or no weight should be given to those views.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, and despite Mr. Scott Manderson&#8217;s submissions to the contrary, I consider that A&#8217;s views are clearly her own.  While it would be idle to suppose that they are not to some extent influenced by those of her mother, it was made clear to me by Ms. Oliver that they are largely based on A&#8217;s own recollection of life in America and her own wish to remain in this country, despite the difficult time she has experienced in the past. I do not consider, as Mr Scott-Manderson submits, that her objections to return are based simply or largely on the fear that her mother may be punished for breach of the orders of the America court.  Such objections could be properly safeguarded by the undertakings offered by the father not to seek or assist in the making of any order in that regard.  A&#8217;s views are strongly expressed and appear to go far wider than that.  Again, for the same reasons as those I have expressed under the heading &#8220;Settlement&#8221;, there are strong welfare considerations in relation to A and her position which militate against sending her back to the United States, given the recent advances made in her self esteem and self confidence, and the likely fragility of those improvements if an order for return to America were made, whatever the outcome of subsequent proceedings there.</p>

However, I shall suspend the operation and effect of the order for dismissal for 14 days from today&#8217;s date to allow time for the father to consider the question of an appeal and, if so advised, to take the appropriate steps.  The orders previously made which prevent the removal of A from England and Wales and from her present address and which relate to the withholding of the mother&#8217;s and A&#8217;s passport will therefore continue for 14 days and will thereafter be discharged subject to any further order of this court or the Court of Appeal.</p>
