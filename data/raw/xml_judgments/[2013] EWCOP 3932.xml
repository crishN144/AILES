	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">PO, who is some 88 years of age, is the mother of four children: the applicant JO, her brothers GO and RO and her sister MP. It is common ground that PO lacks capacity to decide where to live. It is also common ground that, until the events which have given rise to this litigation, PO was habitually resident in England and Wales, living in her own home in Worcestershire with a mixture of family and other support and care, in particular support from Worcestershire County Council which had been involved since 2009. GO and RO are PO&#8217;s financial attorneys under an enduring power of attorney granted in 2004 and registered in 2010.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The facts giving rise to the litigation, initially in Scotland and now in the Court of Protection, are shortly stated. In April 2012 PO&#8217;s son, GO, moved her to Scotland, initially to his own house but quite shortly after to a care home located within the area of responsibility of Inverclyde Council. The Council became aware of PO and her circumstances early in May 2012. For various reasons which there is no need for me to rehearse, the Council applied to the Sheriff Court for a welfare guardianship order under the relevant provisions of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000. The application was made on the basis that, although PO was not habitually resident in Scotland, she was present there and it was urgent that the application be dealt with, so that the Scottish courts had jurisdiction by virtue of paragraph 1(c) of Schedule 3 to the 2000 Act (the analogous English provision being paragraph 7(1)(c) of Schedule 3 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>). It is on that basis that the Sheriff Court accepted and has since exercised jurisdiction.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no need to go through the proceedings in the Sheriff Court in any great detail. The Sheriff made an interim welfare guardianship order in July 2012 appointing the Council&#8217;s chief social work officer as PO&#8217;s welfare guardian with powers in relation to her personal welfare. The full hearing of the Council&#8217;s application followed in November 2012. The Sheriff gave judgment in December 2012 confirming the interim order and extending it for three years (see section 58(4) of the 2000 Act). I need only add that at an interim hearing in November 2012 the Sheriff had dismissed an argument advanced by JO that the Scottish courts did not have jurisdiction and that there has been no attempt by JO to appeal any of the Sheriff&#8217;s orders.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">JO&#8217;s application to the Court of Protection for permission to bring her application had been made earlier in November 2012. As subsequently refined what JO seeks is an order from the Court of Protection for the return of PO to England and Wales. The Council&#8217;s riposte is an application under Rule 87 of the Court of Protection Rules 2007 for a declaration that the Court of Protection has no jurisdiction to hear JO&#8217;s application, PO being no longer habitually resident in England and Wales, alternatively declining to exercise any jurisdiction it may have. JO&#8217;s three siblings support the Council&#8217;s stance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matter came before me for directions on 20 March 2013. On 26 June 2013 Senior Judge Lush dismissed an application by JO to restrain the sale of PO&#8217;s house in Worcestershire. In accordance with the directions I had given, JO&#8217;s application and the Council&#8217;s cross-application came on for hearing before me on 30 July 2013. JO was represented by Ms Claire van Overdijk and the Council by Mr Alex Ruck Keene. GO, RO and MP were not represented (though GO and MP were present during the hearing) but each had made their position clear in written documents filed with the court. At the end of the hearing I reserved judgment. JO renewed her application for an order preventing the sale of PO&#8217;s house. I refused to make any order. Subsequently, on 15 August 2013, JO issued a further application. I shall return to this below.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It follows that, in my judgment, the question of authority to remove is the key in this case to the question of habitual residence. Habitual residence is an undefined term and in English authorities it is regarded as a question of fact to be determined in the individual circumstances of the case. It is well recognised in English law that the removal of a child from one jurisdiction to another by one parent without the consent of the other is wrongful and is not effective to change habitual residence &#8230; It seems to me that the wrongful removal (in this case without authority under the directive whether because Part 3 is not engaged or the decision was not made in good faith) of an incapacitated adult should have the same consequence and should leave the courts of the country from which she was taken free to take protective measures. Thus in this case were the removal &#8216;wrongful&#8217;, I would hold that MN was habitually resident in California &#8230;  </p>

The position in April 2010 was that MN had been living with her niece in England and Wales on the basis that the niece was providing her with a permanent home. There is no evidence other than that MN is content and well cared for there and indeed may lose or even have lost any clear recollection of living on her own in California. In those circumstances it seems to me most probable that MN will have become habitually resident in England and Wales and this court will be required to accept and exercise a full welfare jurisdiction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> pursuant to para 7(1)(a) of Sch 3.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Addressing the <span style="font-style:italic">Spiliada </span>principles, Mr Ruck Keene submits that Scotland is clearly the more appropriate forum and that there are no special circumstances pointing in favour of England. He summarises his key submissions as follows. First, as he points out, questions relating to PO&#8217;s welfare, including most significantly the question of where she should live, have been before the Sheriff Court for some time and that court continues to exercise jurisdiction and, moreover, in an entirely appropriate manner. It cannot, he suggests, be in PO&#8217;s best interests for matters in dispute to be litigated in the courts of two different countries, not least bearing in mind the additional costs that will be incurred, some at her expense. Secondly, there is no English public authority which currently considers it has responsibility for PO&#8217;s welfare, whereas for the time being, and indeed so long as she remains in Scotland, the Council has that responsibility. Thirdly, most of the witnesses whose evidence would be relevant to the issues JO seeks to ventilate are in Scotland. Mr Ruck Keene acknowledges that it would be more convenient for JO to attend court in England but submits that it would be to the same extent more convenient for GO to attend court in Scotland. Fourthly, and in sum, all the matters in dispute have the most real and substantial connection with Scotland and there are no special circumstances requiring that the Court of Protection should nevertheless accept jurisdiction.</p>

She submits that it is unrealistic to imagine litigation in both courts, that this court is better placed than the Sheriff Court to examine and determine the issue of wrongful removal, and that if PO is in fact returned to England this court will likewise be better placed to monitor the arrangements. </p>

There is no longer any need to determine the issue of wrongful removal and all the other issues are, as Mr Ruck Keene submits, plainly better suited to decision by the Sheriff Court, being the court of the country where PO is living and where most of the relevant witnesses are. Moreover, in the event of the Sheriff Court deciding that PO should return to England, appropriate steps, including the involvement of the Court of Protection, can, no doubt, be taken at that stage to ensure that the arrangements put in place for PO are properly monitored. Scotland is the <span style="font-style:italic">forum conveniens </span>and there are no special circumstances requiring the Court of Protection nonetheless to assume jurisdiction.</p>

It is clear to me that the judgment should be delivered in public, in open court. That is indicated not just by what in my view is the pressing need for the Court of Protection to operate and be seen to operate in an open and transparent fashion but also because, as it happens, the judgment deals with certain questions of law of general importance. On the other hand, it is in my judgment equally clear that the judgment should be published, as GO seeks, in an anonymised form which respects his mother&#8217;s (PO&#8217;s) privacy and dignity. It is for that reason that neither PO nor her children have been identified, whether by name or otherwise, and that I have been deliberately sparing in the details I have given of matters which should remain private to PO and her family. </p>
