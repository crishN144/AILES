Their parents are CM 22 years and LW 24 years. Up until 25 April both children were in the care of their parents. In the early hours of that morning MN collapsed and was admitted to hospital, he was found to have an acute subdural haemorrhage for which there was no reported event that accounted for these injuries. He was also found to have a chronic subdural haemorrhage as well as posterior rib fractures (both sides) likely to have been caused by squeezing and metaphyseal fractures caused by flailing or a pulling mechanism.</span></p>

Inevitably such a loss has had a severe impact on the mother. She has had long term support from the mental health services and is on long term medication to manage her mental health. Prior to giving her oral evidence she wrote a very moving letter to me setting out why she asks this court to give her one last chance to look after her children. With her particular background it is a very powerful letter but I have to consider the future welfare needs of these young children in accordance with the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and only make orders that will meet their welfare needs, which is the courts paramount consideration.   </span></p>

The evidence about how the parents argued has, like many other details in this case, changed as the case progressed.

When I returned CM was still in attack mode. She grabbed a pair of scissors and tried to attack me with them. OW and DW took the scissors off her. She came at me again. I grabbed her wrists and pushed her onto the sofa. She was struggling beneath me. She was hurting herself. MN was crying. I went over to soothe him. I then walked out of the house about 11am.&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> In KY&#8217;s statement she reports receiving a text from the father at 10.57 stating </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;don&#8217;t come get me today Mum it&#8217;s all kicked off between me and her and I&#8217;m gonna beat her up soon I hate her&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> In the mother&#8217;s second statement dated 8 November she described a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;physical argument&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> that day &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">apparently I misheard LW and he became angry.

He inserted in manuscript that the mother has scissors and lunged at the father, he said in oral evidence he had corrected a version of a statement he had returned to the solicitors previously which subsequent enquiries revealed he had made no changes to. In his police interview on 5 May DW describes an argument and makes mention of the mother having a pair of scissors, in his statement 14 September he refers to LW getting off her having pinned her down on the sofa </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;CM picked up a pair of scissors, I grabbed hold of LW and OW grabbed hold of CM.

I consider it is more likely than not that the father fed MN just prior to him being put to bed about 2am and that it is more likely than not that he put him to bed. That routine was generally consistent with what had happened on previous nights.</span></p>

One that occurred on the morning of 25 April that caused the acute neurotrauma and retinal haemorrhages. The other two injuries, the chronic neurotrauma and the fractures were caused either separately or together. In the absence of a memorable event within the time frames and faced with the parents failure to give a credible account of events it is difficult to be more specific. In the experts meeting Mr Jayamohan acknowledges that the force required for the initial neurotrauma is beyond normal handling and there is some evidence that doing it causes the child to go to sleep but in fact has encephalopathy after being shaken, he says </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;I think that normal handling would be highly unlikely to cause this, rough play if you get into the extreme end where it starts to go, possibly would raise an eyebrow for someone who saw this happening, but may not be realised by the person who&#8217;s doing it. It could easily be in the interface and then you go into the very extremes where, obviously, people actually purposely do this and I don&#8217;t&#8217; think there&#8217;s necessarily any evidence in this case that people may know what they&#8217;re doing, and that&#8217;s borne out by the evidence&#8217;.</span></p>

It involved OW and someone called C and was very likely operated from the family home in the way he described. He accepts he has difficulties in controlling his anger and it is clear that his involvement with drug dealing over many years involves the ever present spectre of violence, either the fear of people coming to the home (for example his evidence about these concerns when the mother became pregnant) or his threats of violence to others to secure the payment of monies owed to him.

The chilling oral evidence from the neighbour of the repeated arguments she heard from their home gives a revealing account of what the reality of their relationship was and the impact on any child in their care. Her evidence, which there was no real challenge, was of hearing a child who was left to cry and cry, of repeated full scale arguments between the parents at high volume, the father shouting </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;shut that fucking thing up&#8217; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">followed by the child going quiet very quickly.

But as the evidence has developed during this hearing it is quite clear the reality of day to day life in the family home was very different and was not revealed to the professionals. In particular the level of cannabis use, around five joints a day shared by both parents usually starting from the morning. It is very likely the mother continued using cannabis during her pregnancies. The involvement of the father with drug dealing and the inherent risks involved in such activity. The level and frequency of arguments in the home, with frequent outbursts of violent behaviour between the parents. The inconsistent evidence about the mother&#8217;s reliability in taking her mental health medication and the impact of taking it with drugs and/or alcohol. Finally, the number of visitors and the level of drinking in the home. Each of these factors, if known, would have escalated the level of concern for the welfare of the children. If they had all been known it would, in my judgment, have been very likely these children would have been under a child protection plan, if not within care proceedings due to the very high level of risk. </span></p>

At that time they were still together. Whilst making all due allowances for the mother&#8217;s distress at being arrested, her background circumstances and being held for some time prior to the interview it is clear the mother was able to give a long free flowing narrative account of events prior to MN&#8217;s admission. Within that was a wholly untrue account of events on the evening before MN&#8217;s collapse. For example taking her medication and going to bed at 9pm. It was not until during the course of this hearing, some six months later and after filing three detailed statements that the mother was able to finally confirm her account about who fed and put MN to bed in the early hours of 25 April. In her oral evidence she was unable to give a credible explanation of why there had been such uncertainty about her position until so late. This provides support for the position that this mother prefers to wait and see how things pan out before finally confirming her position. In effect keeping her options open, concerned about her position rather than seeking to assist with a coherent account of what happened to MN.

This is perhaps best illustrated by the events on 13 April with the arrival of DW, the father&#8217;s brother. He arrived late at night with someone who was not known to either parent. They were obviously heavily under the influence of drink and drugs. He was a known heroin/cocaine addict and the account put forward that he wanted to come and visit his newly arrived nephew lacks any credibility. It is more likely that he was fleeing Hatfield due to some drug related feud. Within moments of removing a crack pipe from him he is left by the parents in the sole care of MN (then age 3 weeks) without a second thought. They seemed more concerned with going outside for a cigarette with the person who they had never met before. Within a short period of time the level of MN&#8217;s screams draw the mother back inside to find DW has fallen asleep on the sofa and was unaware of MN having fallen off him into the sofa cushions and become very distressed. Whilst the experts rule this out as being an event that caused the injuries neither parent in their oral evidence really grasped the level of risk this put MN at. The mother remained defensive about what had happened in her oral evidence, saying </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;he [DW] wanted to cuddle MN</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8217; before somewhat reluctantly accepting, only when pressed by Ms Taylor, that what she did was very dangerous and completely irresponsible. It was obvious the parents&#8217; concern for others within their circle of drug users was put way above the needs of these two young children; that is the only way to explain the arrival of even more adults (OW and NG) in the following days to an already over-crowded home in circumstances where these adults were at risk themselves.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.04in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Within this chaotic period when MN was at home the volatility of the parents&#8217; relationship was bound to erupt. There can be little doubt now that the parents&#8217; relationship from the start has been volatile, vocal, argumentative and on occasion resorted to violence which continued during the time they cared for both children. They are both very strong characters that have a mutual dependency on each other, which I strongly suspect is not far below the surface even now. The record of police call outs started in September 2014, continued in 2015 with the repeated theme of shouting and high volume arguments of such a level that warranted the police being called. At the early stages of these proceedings I am quite satisfied the parents sought to play that part of their relationship down, there is no mention of it in their detailed chronologies of the events on 24 April other than a reference to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;bickering&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> on that day, they put pressure on witnesses not to mention it. Even now the evidence about what happened that day is far from clear. What started the argument on the 24</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> April neither parent, somewhat surprisingly, professes to remember, so what triggers such a violent incident remains unclear. Whilst the evidence is that both parents were capable of verbal and physical abuse towards each other it is quite clear the father is the physically stronger of the two and was able to pin the mother down in such a way as she describes with both DW and OW trying to pull them off each other. For MN who was  present it must have been both terrifying and distressing. A late entry into the account of this event has been that the mother used scissors when she attacked the father. This was not mentioned by the father in his police interview in May, or in either parent&#8217;s account in their first statements. It first appeared in the father&#8217;s statement in September, which was after the events with BH had taken place which the father was so jealous about. It did not appear in what OW told the police, was not in the statement that was prepared for him by the local authority&#8217;s team until he corrected it in manuscript on the day he attended to give evidence, even though he gave evidence that he had corrected the draft statement previously to add this which was found out not to be true. I am satisfied on the evidence that even though it was mentioned by DW the mother did not use scissors against the father on 24 April, if she had done it would have been mentioned earlier by the father and its late entry as a feature of the argument in his and OW&#8217;s account is due to the father&#8217;s influence over other witnesses to support his late claim about it to undermine the mother&#8217;s position so she could be responsible for the injuries to MN or through his jealousy regarding her relationship with BH or, more likely, a combination of the two. </span></p>

She had experience of domestic violence before and the support that was available to assist her retain the care of her child. In her oral evidence the mother&#8217;s repeated refrain was that the reason why she did not disclose the violence to any of the professionals visiting her home at the relevant time was because of her fear of losing the care of the children. That doesn&#8217;t stand up to scrutiny in the light of her previous experiences. The failure to report and seek support is more likely to be due to her strong feelings for the father, her unwillingness to put the children&#8217;s welfare first and her wish to maintain her relationship and lifestyle. The reporting of these events so late into these proceedings, in her two statements filed in the two weeks prior to the start of the hearing and by reporting the allegations to the police less than a week before these proceedings is likely to have been heavily influenced by the complex dynamics in the relationship between the parents and her wish to demonstrate he was more likely to cause the injuries to MN. There are inconsistencies in some of the accounts given by the mother, as outlined by Ms Campbell in her cross examination of the mother and set out in her closing submissions. Due to the inherent unreliability of the mother it is very difficult to make specific findings on the allegations of violence she makes other than my findings about 24 April and the more general finding which is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence that the parents&#8217; relationship from the start was highly volatile, involved each regularly screaming verbal abuse at one another and at the children to the point where neighbours became alarmed and frightened for the children and called the police. There were occasions when their arguments ended in violent behaviour towards each other but the father was physically stronger and on occasions would restrain the mother. In my judgment this behaviour continued up until the children were removed from their care, for example as reported by DW in his police interview.</span></p>

An example is the lack of candour to the mother&#8217;s mental health worker TBR. In her letter dated 23 June 2016 she states </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;Previous history of substance misuse, currently abstinent.

All this points towards him discussing his evidence with the father and adapting it so that it supports the father&#8217;s position. JN, DP and BW were all very surprised to learn of the evidence about the father shouting at the children in the way described by the neighbours. Each of those witnesses, who were related to and had been supportive of the mother in the past, chose to file statements with only critical comments about the mother in large part probably influenced by the father. </span></p>

He had significant medical difficulties, was not easy to settle, didn&#8217;t sleep for longer than 2 hours at a time and presented as colicky, unhappy and crying and didn&#8217;t feed very easily. Both these parents, who each had difficulties in controlling their temper, were barely coping. They were becoming increasingly tired, their relationship was under great strain not helped by the pressures caused by so many adults staying in the home and the level of drug taking. I am satisfied that neither parent has given a truthful account of the care given to MN during the time he was in their care.   </span></p>

The suggestion on behalf of the father that he met him once after answering someone&#8217;s telephone he had possession of, that he came round to their home once and when out in Brighton he and the mother decided to contact him to spend the evening together resulting in him spending the night at their home in a &#8216;clinch&#8217; with the mother simply does not ring true. There is much more to their involvement with BH than the parents, for whatever reason, are prepared to reveal. What is clear is that soon after the parents separated the mother quickly formed a relationship with BH. This is consistent with her pattern of relationships in the past.  It is more likely than not to have been a sexual relationship and, as with the mother&#8217;s previous relationship, it gained an intensity at a very early stage. He had stayed at least one night at the family home, I strongly suspect there were other occasions, and was taking her to and collecting her from her contact with the children. In her oral evidence she said she had lent him &#163;200 from &#163;400 she had saved for the children so he could buy clothes and shoes for his son; that is simply not credible. What is more likely is he had stolen her purse leaving her unable to get to court the following day.   Within days of their relationship BH had posted photographs of them together on facebook declaring he was in a &#8216;relationship&#8217;, the mother put the same photograph on her phone so that when she contacted people the photo showed up. For the mother to maintain, as she did in her oral evidence, that she did this because she liked the photograph perhaps illustrates the extent of her ability to deceive.   </span></p>

In my judgment the evidence establishes it is more likely than not there was a violent incident between them that resulted in the police being called out on 12 September and her receiving physical injuries. This conclusion is supported by the evidence of TBN which in large part the mother accepted apart from his description of the bruises, and the fact that she stayed at TBN&#8217;s that night due to her level of fear. Also the documentation from the police that showed she would not let the police in. The explanation of the anniversary of L&#8217;s death lacked credibility as it was some weeks away, it was more likely to be due to the fact that she did not want them to see any injuries. The near contemporaneous texts that were exchanged between the father and P on the 12 September add further support. It is not without significance as to where the mother&#8217;s priorities lay that these events all took place when she should have been attending a LAC review regarding her children. </span></p>

They have each become so wrapped up in their lies that it looks very unlikely that MN will have the benefit of learning what happened to him to cause these injuries. I have determined that the father caused the acute injury, most probably through a loss of temper. He was providing most of the care in the early hours and there was evidence of his frustration regarding MN&#8217;s crying and difficulty in feeding. There is some suggestion from the mother that she saw the father rocking MN in his arms a bit too hard on the night of the 18 April and TM reports a conversation with the father after MN had gone into hospital where he thought he shook the moses basket too hard and she was not to tell anyone. But the unreliability of each of these witnesses through the inherent unreliability of their evidence and/or the risk TM has been influenced by the mother makes it difficult to rely on their accounts. Equally there is evidence, which I accept, of the mother being overwhelmed by caring for MN (for example the messages to KV on 19 April and the messages on 24 April) and the difficulties in her relationship with the father in the context where there is evidence of her ability to lose her temper and shout and scream at the children in frustration. She had not bonded with MN, evidenced by her failure to attend at the hospital, and he was by all accounts a very difficult child to feed and calm down. The parents&#8217; evidence was he only slept for 2 hours at a time. They were in all likelihood exhausted not only through caring for the children but by dealing with the number of adults in the home at the time. This combination of events, coupled with significant drug use and alcohol consumption (with medication in the case of the mother) meant the situation regarding the care of MN was liable to erupt at any time with either or both parent. Only the parents know what really went on in the home with their care of MN.</span></p>

It was only as the evidence unfolded during this hearing did the local authority learn about the arrangements KY had made to place MY with wider members of the family, contrary to the written agreement with the local authority. In particular with JN on two occasions for the day following an initial visit to the home and with BW on a weekly basis. Both of those arrangements were in direct contravention to the agreement with the local authority that such people needed to be assessed and DBS checked. For KY to say she thought that had been done does not stand up to any scrutiny, particularly when the local authority had made that position clear at a meeting with her on 13 June about the concerns there were over the number of carers for MY. MC did not know either  BW or JN. What is perhaps more alarming about the arrangement with JN is that it seems to have been arranged following initial contact by the mother. These arrangements show no understanding of the need for MY to have a limited number of carers.</span></p>

Even following the events of 24 April when according to the father and DW she had been told what had gone on and received the text from the father about beating up the mother, she appeared unconcerned. Her behaviour in sending the text to S, who she did not know, expressing her blunt views about the mother was on any view a serious mis-judgment, but is revealing about her true feelings regarding the mother. As a long term carer for MY she is unlikely to be able to give MY a balanced view of her upbringing.</span></p>

He has comprehensively and effectively misled all the professionals who were visiting the home about the extent of drug use in the home, his involvement in drug dealing, the inherent risks of harm consequent on that and his volatile and violent relationship with the mother coupled with his loss of temper when caring for the children.</span></p>

Whilst the steps he has taken should be commended they are very early steps against a background of chronic drug use and his social contacts remaining very much in the drug related world. Apart from a generalised reference to wanting to seek some counselling he has taken no steps to put that support into effect and the history shows he has been unwilling to access such support in the past.</span></p>

In my judgment there are real concerns about the mother&#8217;s lack of insight, even in relation to essential child protection. As I have set out above her oral evidence about the inherent risks of leaving her three week old son with DW who he didn&#8217;t know and who was off his head due to drugs did not seem to occur to her until pressed in questions by Ms Taylor. In her oral evidence she was defensive and as the evidence unfolded it was clear she had failed to give an accurate account about many matters, for example the level of her drug taking. That only came about with the disclosure of the neighbours statement prior to her giving evidence which referred to the smell of cannabis in the morning. The setting against which Dr Keating was concluding that she had insight has changed dramatically. He thought she had not had a relationship for 3 months and understood the risks of her previous relationships. In the light of my findings that is not the case, she seamlessly went from separating with the father to her relationship with Mr H which she gave no details about to Dr Keating (within 24 hours of the police being called due to difficulties in the relationship) and three weeks later she denied to Mr Pizzey even knowing someone called BH. In my judgment she shows no insight into the concerns of the local authority or the risks from the relationships she forms. She has not been abstinent from alcohol, only a self reporting reduction, and her most recent drug tests leave open the question whether she has taken cocaine in the recent past (namely between the end of February and the end of May 2016), with her somewhat elaborate explanation of being fed by someone who may have had cocaine on their hands being rejected by the drug testing agency in their letter dated 18 November.</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The foundation of any insight is honesty; that is something which I&#8217;m afraid to conclude is not a characteristic the mother has yet demonstrated to any great degree, if at all. Even in her oral evidence when asked whether she had spoken to a witness and informed them of the oral evidence prior to that witness attending to give evidence themselves, she denied it before accepting that is what she had done. Fundamental to any consideration of assessment of her ability to meet the needs of these very vulnerable children, who she already has a difficult relationship with, would be to have an honest open relationship with any professionals working with her. In my judgment the mother seems far away from giving any professional working with her that re-assurance. On the information I have it is very likely to take many months, if not significantly longer, to even get to that starting place.  This would also be a fundamental part of any of the support she seeks from the various organisations she has contacted.</span></p>

She has known of the need for this since April, there remains uncertainty about what her employers will be able to offer, at most it is flexibility rather than any reduction in hours so there will still be multiple carers to manage MY&#8217;s care each week. I recognise the distress she will have from any move in placement but her welfare needs will be better met in taking that step now and placing her with MN&#8217;s foster carer.

I recognise the steps he has taken to come off drugs, to remove himself from the drug dealing world, his willingness to access support and the advantages to the children of being brought up by a parent. However he has caused MN significant physical harm and remains in the pool of perpetrators regarding the chronic head injury and fractures. Whilst he recognises at one level his difficulties in controlling his aggression, he has not sought any help to address that. He remains in my view a very significant risk of physical harm if he resumed the care of these children, not only through his aggression but also the likely exposure of them to the risks from the drug related world he is very likely to resort back to without extensive and long term support, which has not even started.  </span></p>

It is right she has taken some steps. I am told she is living in a safe house, has lined up the various agencies to support her and wants to put herself forward to care for the children. Despite my very real reservations about her ability to work openly and honestly with professionals and the risks inherent with her remaining in the pool of perpetrators for the chronic head injury and fractures I will give the mother a short period of time to consider what steps, if any, she proposes to take regarding the section 38(6) application having considered the terms of this judgment.</span></p>
