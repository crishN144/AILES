This applies in the present case to those witnesses who gave evidence from Kabul, at a distance from the interpreters in London.  These two interpreters had difficulty understanding the witnesses and their language at times, and the evidence was quite frequently interrupted while matters were clarified.  Overall, the quality of those parts of the hearing was adequate, but no better than that.</span></p>

In evidence, the date was changed to September 2009.  The father says that he has never lifted his hands to the mother at any stage (though I note he accepted grabbing her by the face during the course of the incident in which I&#8217;s nose was injured).  I find this allegation proved, the date being September 2009 or thereabouts.  I reach this conclusion because I prefer the evidence of the mother on this question to the evidence of the father, and because there is some photographic support for her claim.  In two photographs taken around the time, one of which is attached to the mother's driving licence dated 26 September, a mark is clearly visible below the mother's eye.  She says, and I accept, that this is the residue of a bruise around the whole eye.  I reject the father's explanation that it is the result of a burn caused by cooking oil.</span></p>

The father says that he has never had anal intercourse at any time.  I do not believe him.  I accept the mother's detailed evidence about these events and the pain that they caused her.  She describes the second occasion as involving the use of some considerable force, and causing injury.  In October 2010, the mother visited the GP, complaining of an anal fissure.  At the time she made her allegation, she did not have sight of this record, and in my view it provides some corroboration for her account.</span></p>

I nonetheless accept that the father behaved in the way that she describes.

I find it more probable that she knew that this was a holiday with her family and the father&#8217;s.  This is what she told the consular staff in Kabul.  I accept the evidence of Dr B that the mother spoke of a forthcoming holiday and of the neighbour Mr T that she was present when he and the father discussed the trip.  I find that the mother knew that the vaccination she received was for a trip to Afghanistan, as recorded in her GP notes.  Moreover, a trip to see family would have been an entirely natural event after an absence of two years and the arrival of a new grandchild.  In contrast, this family was in no position to take a holiday in Dubai and no accommodation had been booked.  I accept that the father took the lead in making arrangements of this kind, but not that the mother was so passive that she took no interest in where they were going.  Dubai is the natural staging point for travel to and from Afghanistan, and I do not accept that the mother walked onto the second flight before realising where it was bound.  I also suspect that the evidence of the father's family that the maternal grandmother was present at the airport in Kabul is likely to be correct, but I make no finding about it as she was not asked about this.</span></p>

They attempted to control her movements, particularly when I was with her.  They would not have allowed her to take I with her after the incident when he injured himself because the father was angry and they regarded her as negligent.  The only way that she could be with her son, who had never been apart from her before, was by returning to live with them.  I reject their explanation that the mother was happy to live with them for weeks at a time in preference to her own family.  I find that on 20 September 2011 there was a serious disturbance at the paternal home, sufficient to cause consternation among the neighbours, and that this caused the mother to flee and to be so concerned for her safety that she sought refuge, preferring to live in a shelter for 2&#189; months than to live with her own family.  I further find that the father and his family pursued the matter through legal means, portraying the mother as an unsuitable parent, imposing conditions, and contesting custody.  Cumulatively, this placed considerable pressure upon the mother and caused her acute anxiety about the father's intentions.  It is this that explains her seeking help from the authorities to return safely to England.  Taken together with the abuse that she had suffered in this country, I find that the mother's concerns were essentially genuine.  They will have been increased by the father&#8217;s extensive lies during these proceedings.</span></p>

I make no finding either way about whether the paternal grandfather threatened the mother with a gun in the way that she describes.  The grandfather denies ever having owned a weapon.  The only evidence is the mother's own account, unsupported by her own mother who was present.  I do not accept that the grandfather remained indoors: I find that he was very upset at the situation that he found and that he was part of the general fracas that took place but I am not prepared to make a finding of this seriousness on such limited evidence.</span></p>
