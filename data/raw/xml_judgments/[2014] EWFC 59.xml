There was no opposition to that  decision. The cases have become known as D, E and F. All of the children subject to these  proceedings have since May 2014 been placed away from their birth families with foster carers. </span></p>

Her response was to say &#8216;No way I&#8217;m not. That means I&#8217;d have to go two times and remembering about them makes me sick&#8217;. She asked whether the family case concerned her siblings, when she was told it didn&#8217;t she repeated her refusal to give evidence in more explicit terms. The police officer reports that she discussed with Z the special measures that could be put in place for her to give evidence, but she stated she could not put her mind to it.

From her assessment she stated </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;Psychologically Z presents as a person who has a limited ability to concentrate and attend within situations, especially in situations that she does not find rewarding or does not see the necessity of, and of course, situations that she wishes to avoid psychologically because of distress that the memories potentially cause to her. Z appears to be psychologically a person who does not necessarily comply easily with authority and there is a possibility that she could, in my opinion, present as angry and disinterested in a trial situation if she is faced with the recollection of trauma.....I consider that it is highly likely that when Z is distressed she is more likely to respond in an antagonistic way and it is likely that she would in such a situation withdraw or become aggressive or antagonistic, rather than cope with underlying distress and psychological difficulties. This psychological aspect of her functioning, in my opinion, would affect her ability to give evidence and deal with a Court situation. Furthermore, she does have a history of emotional and behavioural difficulties described within her records and if Z is under a situation of acute pressure or distress her behaviour may become inappropriate and disruptive. Such a situation would clearly be detrimental to Z psychological functioning and detrimental in terms of her ability to deal with the Court case.&#8217;</span></p>

However, I am of the opinion tentatively that Z, with support, is strong enough to give evidence in both courts, but close monitoring of  her psychological stability will be needed. I am of this opinion because Z presents as extremely determined to see justice done in relation to her alleged abusers. In my opinion she needs to be enabled to keep her focus on the issue of her receiving a degree of justice in order to facilitate her continued co-operation.&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> It is of note that she did not discuss giving evidence in both cases directly with Z during the assessment.</span></p>

If Z gives  evidence in the family law hearing, prior to the criminal case, it is the view of the local  authority with responsibility for Z, that this puts her in grave danger and at risk of significant  harm, it is felt that the risk to Z and potentially others is extremely significant and could lead  to her being seriously harmed or worse.&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> She refers to the concerns about risk of Z  absconding,  particularly if there is some distance to travel to enable her to give evidence.

Her level of volatility and challenging  behaviour  evidences this.

The  majority of the trauma which she has experienced is currently unknown to professionals and  the potential for re-traumatising her by placing her as a witness is significantly high and could  have lifelong emotional consequences for her...I am of the view that Z should not give  evidence in the family hearing and that to call, her as a witness would place emotional stress  upon her which would be significantly detrimental to her mental health and could potentially  destabalise the current placement.&#8217;</span></p>

She said Z&#8217;s reaction was to say it was not her job to help social  workers, she would not give evidence and could not be made to give evidence, even if the judge  said she should. The social worker accepted that Z is very anti social services, who she feels  brought her into care by tricking her parents to sign papers.

I have carefully considered the context in which she has   expressed her wishes; namely to the officer in the case and the social worker. She is   reported to have a trusting relationship with the officer, but in their discussions was   unable to countenance the prospect of giving oral evidence twice and an important    feature from her perspective is that these proceedings did not concern her siblings. As   regards the views she expressed to the social worker I have borne in mind her negative   views about social  services, but the social worker who went to see her was not her    allocated social worker, she is an experienced social worker and she saw her on two   occasions so was able to  assess her views and reactions over a period of time. Her    written and oral evidence was clear; Z is unwilling to give evidence in these     proceedings. I have carefully considered whether when faced with a direction by this   court to give evidence she would, in fact, actually comply. Whilst that is a possibility it is   more likely that she would not and, in fact, such a direction is likely to cause her more   distress and increase her level of anxiety.</span></p>

Whilst superficially   attractive I cannot ignore the points made by the intermediary, who has probably had the   most consistent involvement with Z. In her reports she is very clear of the need for    there to be consistent support for Z. In the light of the experience of others (in    particular the psychologist who could not be seen to be connected to social services) it   seems very unlikely that Z will easily be able to comprehend the alternative view of   something she is so vehemently against in just one meeting. It is only likely to be    considered by her, if at all, if explained by someone with whom she has an established   trusting relationship with over a period of time. That is likely to take some time and may   not succeed.  As the intermediary observed there is a real risk of overloading Z with   demands if she is required to give evidence in these proceedings in the context of the   situation she is in, namely in the build up to preparing to give evidence in the criminal   proceedings. In my judgment the same applies, in the context of her situation now, to any   further assessment of her understanding of the purpose of these family proceedings with   a view to seeking her agreement to give evidence in these proceedings too.</span></p>

The court will be able to    observe the DVDs of Z and all parties will have the opportunity to challenge or support   the accounts give by her on the other available evidence. The court will be able to direct   itself in advance of making the appropriate factual conclusions.

The family court, as is often the case, is caught between a rock and a hard place.  The children who are the subject matter of these proceedings have been in interim care for six  months already, any further delay is likely to be detrimental to their welfare. However, there  may be an argument that even if the family proceedings conclude this year it may be difficult, if  it is directed, to undertake any active assessment of the birth family until the outcome of the  criminal proceedings is known. If that is the case it could be said an adjournment may have  some advantages in that the court would possibly have the transcripts of the evidence of Z  within the criminal proceedings and the prospect of a willingness of Z to give oral evidence  in these proceedings. Patently there are inherent risks with that course, which include the  criminal proceedings being adjourned or for some other reason not being effective. In my  judgment, on the information currently available, that course would only result in further  unacceptable delays for the children in these proceedings. </span></p>

Their interim report was published in July and the final report is due in the New Year. Where there are parallel criminal and family proceedings it would, all things being equal, be of great assistance if there was a high level of co-operation and liaison between the relevant agencies (by that I mean the police, CPS and the LA) to ensure there is, as far as possible, joint work undertaken from the early stages to support a vulnerable witness giving evidence in either proceedings. It was of great concern to this court that on two occasions important evidence from an intermediary that had been commissioned by the police and/or CPS was not automatically made available to the LA, or at least them being notified of its existence. </span></p>
