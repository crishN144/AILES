They met as pen pals in the early 1980s, and met in person for the first time when FX visited the Philippines in 1988. They married in Wales in 1989, and lived in Wales for the first few years of their married life. They hoped to have children, but they lost a baby in early pregnancy and were then turned down for IVF treatment. </p>

When they were there they were introduced to AX, the son of MX&#8217;s younger brother.  Because AX&#8217;s parents were looking for work (they already had three other children) he was looked after by relatives.  FX and MX were the ones who looked after him the most, and as they described it they &#8220;fell in love with him, completely&#8221;.  Because of the way they felt about him, a suggestion was made by AX&#8217;s parents that they might wish to adopt him, and when FX and MX returned back to Wales at the end of the visit, they gave this very serious consideration. They came to the conclusion that they wished to go and live permanently in the Philippines, to offer a home to AX and his newly born sister, BX,  and also to be closer to the maternal family and MX&#8217;s mother.   </p>

The birth parents (MX&#8217;s brother and wife) gave formal consent, and the application was submitted to the Regional trial court in Mandaue City on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March of that year.  A social welfare officer was assigned to make enquiries, and she filed a Home Study report.  Notice of the application was reported in a local newspaper as required by domestic law, and the adoption order was made on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2006 (backdated to the date of the application).

Then in 2010, FX suffered health difficulties, having to undergo abdominal surgery for an intussusception.  There is no national health service in the Philippines, and the cost of these operations placed the family&#8217;s finances under severe strain. Such was the difficulty that FX had no option but to return to the UK to find work to support them. He arrived in 2011, after six years away. He obtained a job. In 2013 FX was able to afford a return visit to his family. Whilst he was there, however, FX began to suffer from a hernia, which was treated after he returned to the UK.  The family looked into whether they would all be able to come over, but discovered that the children&#8217;s adoption would not automatically be recognised here as the Philippines was not listed in the Adoption (Registration of Overseas Adoptions) Order 1973.  Subsequent to this, by virtue of a 2013 Order, which is not retrospective, adoptions in the Philippines are recognised.  </p>

At the time of the adoption application in the Philippines, I accept that both of the applicants were domiciled there.  They had given up their jobs in the UK, and sold their home.  They had packed up all their belongings and had them shipped out. MX&#8217;s domicile of origin was the Philippines, so it is not at all difficult to find that this had revived once she returned to live there. FX had a different domicile of origin, but he had acquired a domicile of choice quickly by all his actions and intentions at that time. I note that he applied for and was granted permanent residence in the Philippines by 2006. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">As to the second requirement, I have the benefit of an expert report from Lorena Supatan, who is an attorney practising in Filipino family law. She clearly advises that the children were lawfully adopted in that country.  In her report she sets out all the evidence that the applicants provided to the court, and notes that they were required to, and did, prove that they were of legal age, good moral character, mentally and physically fit, and at least 16 years older than the children they intended to adopt.  They were taking care of AX and BX and loving them as their own, and were in a position to support them.  A detailed home study report had been completed and recommended that MX and FX were suitable as adopters.  The biological parents had given their full consent, and the children were relatives of MX.  The adoption was in the best interests of the children and in accordance with their welfare.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The expert evidence also confirms the third requirement is met, namely that the effect of the adoption under the law of the Philippines is that the children were and are considered the legitimate children of the applicants, and that all the legal ties between the biological parents and the children were severed.  The adoption order granted the adopters and adoptees all the reciprocal rights of succession in legal and intestate succession without distinction from legitimate filiation.  In this it has the same essential characteristics of an adoption order in this country.  </p>

This is what they have done over the last fourteen years, albeit FX has had to spent most of his time since 2011 in this country.  I accept that he has done this in order to support the family financially, and that he has continued to be committed to them in every way. MX has been with them at all times and physically brought them up over the last nine years. Looking at the case overall, I can see no public policy reason for refusing to make the declaration sought.  </p>

The application is supported by Cafcass.  In addition I accept Ms Cabeza&#8217;s submission that the applicants and the children have an established family life together pursuant to Article 8 ECHR, which this court should respect and recognise.  It follows therefore that the declaration sought under the inherent jurisdiction in relation to the adoption of AX and BX will be granted.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The plain difficulty with this application is that of the children&#8217;s domicile. They have remained at all times since their birth in the Philippines. At the time they were adopted their father was domiciled there and not in the United Kingdom.  In her skeleton argument, Ms Cabeza has suggested that it might be possible for the court to find that upon the return of their father to this jurisdiction in 2011, the children&#8217;s domicile changed along with his, but  I think this is too much of a leap for the court to make.  Although the reason for the long separation of the father from his family was economic, I do not think that the parents can be characterised as living together over this period (which would have enabled the children to have a domicile of dependency in this country).  If they had, how could the father&#8217;s domicile have reverted to his domicile of origin? The fact that the parents were living separately means, according to s4 of the Domicile and Family Proceedings Act, that the children&#8217;s domicile of dependency would have been the same as that of their mother, namely the Philippines. </p>

Looking at the two questions posed in the case of <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Harrison</span> above, however, the answer to the one &#8211; physical presence in the new country &#8211; is clearly not met. I have little evidence about the children&#8217;s individual views as to where they wish to make their future lives, but even if I assume that the answer to that is in this jurisdiction, that is not sufficient. In those circumstances I have come to the conclusion that I cannot grant the declaration being sought under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/57" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s57</ref>.  </p>

No doubt if the children  do establish a domicile here they can make another application should they wish to do so.  The Attorney General has been given notice of these proceedings and has not sought to intervene.  </p>
