	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This matter is listed for a directions hearing at my direction in light of the contumelious failure of the London Borough of Bexley to comply with directions set out in an order of 12 May 2014.  By paragraph 19 of that order the local authority were to file their final evidence by 4.00pm on 2 June.  That deadline was itself an extension of time by the order of 17 February.  The local authority had originally been ordered to file its final evidence by 22 May.  On the front of the order of 12 May, as appears on all of the orders in this matter, there is set out in bold a requirement that each party shall comply timeously with court orders and any party who finds themselves unable to comply with any direction is required to apply to me via my clerk for an extension prior to the expiration of the time for compliance.  Nothing was received from the London Borough of Bexley to further extend time for their compliance with filing their final evidence.  Eight days after they were due to file their final evidence emails were received from solicitors for the other parties notifying the court of the failure of the local authority to file its evidence.  </span></p>

On 11 June a reply was received from the solicitor having conduct of this matter setting out various factors that led to the local authority being unable to comply with paragraph 19 of the order of 12 May.  Accompanying that email was a number of care plans for some of the children.  When a further email was sent asking when the local authority would comply with filing all of its final evidence, a reply was received on 11 June indicating that the solicitor would be in possession of full instructions the following day and would contact the court.  No email was subsequently received.  The final evidence of the local authority was filed and served at 9.21 on Saturday, 14 June.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Counsel for the local authority today helpfully filed a position statement which repeats the reasons given by the local authority for failure to comply.  It was said on behalf of the London Borough of Bexley that no application was made for an extension of time because it was not known when the local authority could comply.  That is simply not good enough and it will not do.  The consequence of the local authority failing to file its evidence in time has delayed the other parties being able to comply with their duties under the order and accordingly they will now be late in filing their evidence.  I have today granted extensions of time to each of the other parties to do so.</span></p>

There is simply no excuse for this.  Orders, including interlocutory orders, must be obeyed and complied with to the letter and on time.  Too often they are not.  They are not preferences, requests or mere indications; they are orders: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (A Child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1227" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1227" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1227</ref>, paragraph 74.</p>

The court is entitled to expect &#8211; and from now on family courts will demand &#8211; strict compliance with all such orders.

The failures by the London Borough of Bexley in this matter are stark.  This hearing would not have been required if they had complied with their orders and, in my judgment, it was right that this matter was listed at the earliest opportunity to address those failings and to enable the other parties to make submissions as to when they could comply with their obligations to file documents.  Accordingly, I am in no doubt that it is right that the local authority should be ordered to pay the costs of this hearing.</span></p>
