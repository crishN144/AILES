	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">T is 8 years old.  She lives with Mr. and Mrs. H, who are family friends of her deceased mother.  Her mother died in 2015.  She has, and has had over the years, a disrupted relationship with her father whom she indisputably loves.  She performs well at school, and is generally healthy.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I settled the arrangements for T&#8217;s future upbringing, following a contested hearing in April 2016; my reasoning is set out in a judgment which I delivered at that time (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re E-R (Child Arrangements)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/805" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 805 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 805 (Fam)</ref> (8 April 2016)).  That judgment was reflected by an order of the same date.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The child arrangements carefully laid out in April 2016 were sadly largely ignored, and indeed very soon breached, by the father and Miss B; I discuss this below.  In the circumstances, in late-September 2016 Mrs. H felt compelled to issue a fresh application seeking the court&#8217;s further directions, specifically seeking further definition of the time which T was to spend with her father and with Miss B.   Over the months since that time, I have given directions in the case generally; I suspended the earlier child arrangements order and re-worked the child arrangements on a temporary basis.  I re-joined T to the litigation by her Children&#8217;s Guardian, and have permitted the filing of evidence.</p>

	    <num>4.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the last three weeks, the father has made it known (through his last witness statement, not by application) that once again he seeks for T to be placed in his full-time care; he confirmed this position at the outset of the hearing.  This is an about-turn of the position which he and Miss B took in December 2016 and February 2017 when they expressly deposed in their written materials to the court to the fact that they &#8220;accept that her main carer is now [Mrs. H] and her main home is in Cornwall.&#8221;  It was notable that, in his closing submissions, the father made no further reference to seeking a change of T&#8217;s main residence, which perhaps reflects his realistic appraisal of the prospects of my ordering the same.  However, I deal with the deemed application below.</p>

I have now heard oral evidence from the protagonists once again (Mrs. H, the father, Miss B and the Children&#8217;s Guardian); I have read the significant file of documents.  This judgment explains my reasoning.</p>

Dr. Gough considers that there is still a "fragility in this bond due to the time that has elapsed since [the mother's] death and repeated separations as a result of the current contact schedule." She considers that T has not identified the father and Miss B as alternative primary attachment figures because of their "inconsistent availability&#8230; problems with emotional attunement, and exposure to conflict." Dr. Gough recommends that T should remain living with Mr. and Mrs. H, expresses concern that "disruption in the aftermath of parental bereavement is linked to later psychological consequences", and concludes that a move to live with her father in Suffolk would be "extremely psychologically harmful to T"; she goes on to opine that T needs "stability and certainty in her life" in order "to continue her bereavement journey", and that contact with her father should be designed to "support" her placement with the Hs&#8221; (&#167;37)</p>

In view of my order, no one would have supposed that this would be otherwise than in Cornwall.  In specific breach of the Child Arrangements Order (see above), the father drove T straight back to his home in Suffolk where they spent the week.  The camping story was a blatant lie; I find that at the time he sent the text he had no intention of camping with T in Cornwall.  On their return, in front of T, the father told Mrs. H that they had been on a camping trip.  More seriously still, he encouraged T (as I find) to lie to Mrs. H about where she had been for the week.   </p>

In their &#8216;pitch&#8217; they incorrectly complained that Mrs. H &#8220;is now trying to completely stop us seeking [T] entirely&#8221; (sic).  They go on to explain the outcome of the April 2016 hearing thus: &#8220;we have lost, as the courts don&#8217;t listen to Litigants in Person&#8221;.  On 28 January 2017, they tweeted news of their attendance in my court at the directions hearing on 16 December 2016, and asked for public support in &#8220;fighting him (I assume me) again&#8221;.  I am wholly satisfied that the father and Miss B have been given every latitude as litigants in person throughout the proceedings over which I have presided, and their unrepresented status has had no bearing on the outcome of the case in April 2016, as it will have no bearing now.  I regret that this is an example (there are others) of them shifting personal responsibility for their distress at their situation onto others. </p>

Mrs. H, understandably in my judgment, felt deceived by the father in relation to the August 2016 holiday, when the father took T to Suffolk in breach of my order, and not in accordance with his stated plan.  She has received unwelcome messages and correspondence from the father and Miss B, and continues to feel beleaguered by unwelcome threats and abuse from them.  I recognise this.  She complains that the father and Miss B have contacted the work-places of herself and her husband with malicious e-mails, though I am not in a position to make any adjudication or finding in relation to this.  </p>

But his approach to the sensitive issues engaged in this dispute, in relation to T and her upbringing, is significantly infected by an underlying anger at what he sees as an injustice in Mr. and Mrs. H raising his daughter.  That anger is passively, and occasionally aggressively, directed at Mrs. H; T has been directly and indirectly, and sadly repeatedly, caught up in that hostility.   It is highly regrettable for all concerned that the father is unable to credit Mrs. H in any respect for her care of T, nor is he able to acknowledge her contribution in raising her.  It reflects poorly on him.  He has limited understanding of the effect of his actions on T; he was not truly in my judgment able to recognise the effect on T of repeatedly cancelling his visits at the last moment.  He does not appreciate T&#8217;s profound disappointment at his non-appearance.  Nor does he appreciate that Mrs. H makes arrangements for T&#8217;s social and recreational weekend life around the schedule of weekend time, which cannot so easily be unscrambled when the father at the last moment indicates his unavailability for contact on the appointed weekend. He has limited respect for the authority of the court, specifically for the Child Arrangements Order, believing that only he should decide when he sees T.  He told me that he had &#8220;not really read&#8221; the court order from April 2016, and professed ignorance and surprise when I pointed out that pursuant to that order he could have phoned T twice per week.</p>

I find myself having to revise my earlier relatively positive view of her influence on the father; sadly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, I find that she has taken on some of the father&#8217;s anger, which she has periodically unleashed in correspondence to Mrs. H, to Mrs. H directly, and behind Mrs. H&#8217;s back.  T has inevitably become aware of this at handovers and on the contact &#8211; perhaps particularly on 3-4 December &#8211; and this has affected T&#8217;s formerly benign view of Miss B. On the occasion that the father drove to Cornwall to collect T in August 2016, Miss B plainly knew that he would be bringing her back to Suffolk; she said that she tried to discourage the father, explaining that there would be a breach of the order, but she failed.  Miss B described the deceit as &#8220;accidental and ill thought-through&#8221;.  There was nothing &#8220;accidental&#8221; about it.

She remains somewhat dogmatic in her views about what is best for T; in part, this has been deployed in order to assert her role as primary carer, which must seem to her (again with justification) to be constantly under threat. Her occasional brusque manner with the father and Miss B may in part be a reflection of these, and other perhaps more complicated, factors.  I am conscious that she has to deal with the unreliability and untrustworthiness of the father with which, I believe, she struggles; I have some sympathy with that.  She has the burden of protecting T from the frustrations, disappointments and distress which surrounds some of the contact, and in that regard I am sure she has done her best.  Quite apart from all that, she must be dismayed at having to be embroiled in litigation once again, at her own expense.  That all said, she has made clear that she feels that the family should persevere with the contact arrangements; she feels that although telephone calls are not always successful, they are important as at least T knows that her father is thinking about her.  She would like the father to take more interest in T&#8217;s schooling.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">I find that T suffered an injury to her foot during the October half-term contact visit, while she was in the care of her father.  There is absolutely nothing to suggest that this was deliberate; I am indeed as sure as I can be that this was an accident.  I am reasonably satisfied that the father will have known that it had happened.  It would have been negligent if he had not.  The father did not mention it to Mrs. H when he returned T.  He should have done.  He did not do so because there is currently no level at, or language in, which the father and Mrs. H currently converse about the welfare of T.  He probably feared that Mrs. H would criticise him for failing adequately to care for T, whereas of course accidents happen, and he would have been much better off acknowledging that fact;</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In relation to the events of the weekend of 3-4 December, I note T&#8217;s vivid account &#8211; which she has given to Mrs H and, in part only, to her friend, Mrs C.  I note that Mrs. H believes T&#8217;s account, in part because she believes that T is fundamentally a truthful child.  I have noted the clear and detailed refutation of those allegations from Miss B. There is of course the possibility that T was indeed locked in the attic and assaulted as she alleges, but it seems, overall, to be unlikely.  The circumstantial evidence does not tend to support such a finding.  As I have earlier indicated, the court does not work on the basis of possibilities; while I find that T did say what she said, I do not find as a fact that T was locked in the attic on 3 December, nor do I find that she was hit by her aunt.  I will proceed on the basis that these events did not happen.  My view is that it is far more likely that T made these complaints as a vehicle for expressing her upset with the situation and with Miss B and KE in particular &#8211; for the confrontation with Mrs. H at the handover, or for taking her to her mother&#8217;s home (I note that T specifically told the Children&#8217;s Guardian &#8220;I felt sad because the house gives me memories of my mum.  I didn&#8217;t know it would upset me&#8221;), or perhaps (as T later described) for speaking disparagingly about Mrs. H and her family during the visit; I wondered whether her description of being locked in an attic was a childish metaphor for her sense of being trapped in this unpleasant situation between the adults;</p>

There is nothing in T&#8217;s presentation which suggests that she is being alienated from her father by the conduct of Mrs. H as the Guardian observes.

He confirmed his position at the hearing.  The lack of an application is not material in itself, save that it perhaps reflects a lack of preparation or planning for what he proposes.  Only when I asked him directly about education in Suffolk for T did he confess that he has not even investigated whether there would be a school place available for T at the local school in Suffolk; term was scheduled to start the week after the hearing.  In evidence filed earlier this year, Miss B advised the court that the couple are financially extremely strapped; she indicated that they can barely afford their living costs &#8220;let alone afford to see T&#8221;, adding that &#8220;three weekly visits is not actually affordable at the moment&#8221;.

He did not refer to the loss of the home in which she has lived for three years (including for a time with her mother), to the break in the continuity of care which she has received, and the relationships which she has formed with Mr. and Mrs. H.   He worryingly responded to my query about impact of change by observing that &#8220;T is a very outgoing child&#8221; as if this indicated that she would thus be insulated from the inevitable upheaval; this calls to mind a passage from my April 2016 judgment: &#8220;her courageous external presentation disguises underlying psychological vulnerability, and persistent anxieties&#8221; (&#167;13 <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/805" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 805 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 805 (Fam)</ref>).
