The letter stated that, following a complaint by the mother, the hospital had commissioned an external review of children with rib fractures. It went on to say:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;The bony injuries were consistent with either non-accidental injury or problems from a metabolic bone perspective, and the review team would have expected the courts to have considered whether screening for Type 1 collagen defect should have been carried out, particularly if indicators had been discovered in the family history or there had been further fractures. The presentation is not inconsistent with that seen in other cases of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) has been the final diagnosis, but bruising, which was present on admission is not typical in such cases.&#8221;</p>

That case was not in fact directly about issue estoppel because the parties were not the same in both sets of proceedings. The subsequent proceedings had a different mother and different children. The actual question was whether the father was bound by a finding of sexual abuse in relation to other children made in the earlier proceedings. The previous finding was plainly admissible; the real question was the weight that should be given to it and how much further evidence, if any, should be allowed in relation to forensic examination of those events. The case was thus concerned with a rule of evidence (admissibility of the prior judgment) and procedural case management powers (the extent of further evidence about those events). In terms of ratio decidendi it had nothing to do with the rule of substantive law expressed in the doctrine of res judicata.</p>

If the court is required to exercise an inquisitorial function and may inquire into facts which the parties do not choose to prove, or would under the adversary system be prevented from proving, this is a function to which the common law concept of estoppel is alien. It may well be a rational rule to apply in the exercise of such an inquisitorial function to say that if a court having jurisdiction to do so has once inquired into the truth of a particular allegation of fact and reached a decision thereon, another court of co-ordinate jurisdiction in the exercise of its own discretion should not re-embark on the same inquiry, but should accept the decision of the first court. But this is a different concept from estoppel as hitherto known in English law. It will be interesting to watch its development in future cases &#8230;&#8221;</p>

The willingness of the family jurisdiction to relax the ordinary rules of issue estoppel &#8230; does not originate from laxity or benevolence but from the recognition that where children are concerned there is likely to be an infinite variety of circumstances whose proper consideration in the best interests of the child is not to be trammelled by the arbitrary imposition of procedural rules. That is a policy whose sole purpose, however, is to preserve flexibility to deal with unusual circumstances. In the general run of cases the family courts &#8230; will be every bit as alert as courts in other jurisdictions. The maxim &#8216;sit finis litium&#8217; is, as a general rule, rigorously enforced in children cases, where the statutory objective of an early determination of questions concerning the upbringing of a child expressed in section 1(2) of the Children Act 1989 is treated as requiring that such determination shall not only be swift but final.&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in"><span style="font-style:italic">Thoday</span> was a divorce case, and from the very inception of judicial divorce in 1858 the process was mandated by the terms of the statute to be inquisitorial: see sections 29 and 30 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857. But that did not mean that the general law concept of estoppel was cast aside in such inquisitorial proceedings. On the contrary, the rule was rigorously applied. An early example was <span style="font-style:italic">Finney v Finney </span>(1868) LR 1 P &amp; D 483 where a wife had petitioned for judicial separation on the ground of cruelty. The charges were defended by the husband. The court found that they were not proved and dismissed the petition. The wife then set up the same charges of cruelty coupled with adultery in a subsequent petition for dissolution. The Judge Ordinary, Sir James Wilde (later Lord Penzance) held that she was estopped from doing so. He stated:</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;But the questions of fact raised in this case are precisely the same as those which were inquired into and determined in a previous suit in this very court. In both suits the husband is charged with the same matrimonial offence, that of cruelty. That issue having been tried, and found in the husband's favour in the former suit, the wife now seeks to have it tried over again, and it is argued that she is entitled to reiterate those identical charges, because she has tacked on to them a charge of adultery. I think that cannot be allowed. According to the practice of every court, after a matter has once been put in issue and tried, and there has been a finding or a verdict on that issue, and thereupon a judgment, such finding and judgment is conclusive between the same parties on that issue. In all courts it would be treated as an estoppel. There is abundant reason why, in this court especially, the same questions should not be tried over again. In most cases the trials are at the cost of the husband, and the Court ought not to allow a wife to persecute a husband as she could do if she were allowed to repeat charges which have once been found against her. The allegations of cruelty must be struck out of the petition.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in;text-indent:-0.50in">So, the inquisitorial nature of the proceedings did not prevent the application of the estoppel in that case. Equally in <span style="font-style:italic">Thoday</span> itself, Diplock LJ accepted and applied the law of estoppel. He held that no estoppel per rem judicatam arose as the wife was alleging a different matrimonial offence in the second proceedings (constructive desertion) to that which she had pleaded in the first (cruelty). No issue estoppel arose because the judge in the earlier proceedings had not made sufficiently precise findings to be able to say that a given issue had been decided in an identifiable way. All he had done was to decide that the wife had not established the matrimonial offence of cruelty she alleged. Thus Diplock LJ concluded his judgment:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;It is, in my view, very desirable that in cases of this kind, where a failed case of cruelty may be later followed by a case based on actual or constructive desertion, judges should state their findings on each of the issues.

It is true that the former is a rule of substantive law (although, as I have stated, Diplock LJ treats it as a rule of procedure) while the inquisitorial alternative would be an unyielding procedural rule based on the principle that a rehearing would be an abuse of process as explained by Lord Diplock in <span style="font-style:italic">Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/report/1982/elr/1/529" isNeutral="false" canonical="[1982] AC 529" reportSeries="elr" year="1982" jurisdiction="GB" type="case">[1982] AC 529</ref> at 541.

This empowers the new Family Court to vary, suspend, rescind or revive any order made by it. But this provision did no more than to give the Family Court effectively the same power in relation to its orders as the County Court (where most care proceedings were heard up to 2014) had possessed since 1846: see section 89 of the County Court Act 1846 and <span style="font-style:italic">CB v EB</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2020/72" isNeutral="true" canonical="[2020] EWFC 72" court="ewfc" year="2020" jurisdiction="GB" type="case">[2020] EWFC 72</ref> at [34].

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">"English law, and it is safe to say, all comparable legal systems, place high in the category of essential principles that which requires that limits be placed upon the right of citizens to open or to reopen disputes. The principle which we find in the Act of 1858 is the same principle as that which requires judgments in the courts to be binding, and that which prohibits litigation after the expiry of limitation periods. Any determination of disputable fact may, the law recognises, be imperfect: the law aims at providing the best and safest solution compatible with human fallibility and having reached that solution it closes the book. The law knows, and we all know, that sometimes fresh material may be found, which perhaps might lead to a different result, but, in the interest of peace, certainty and security it prevents further inquiry. It is said that in doing this, the law is preferring justice to truth. That may be so: these values cannot always coincide. The law does its best to reduce the gap. But there are cases where the certainty of justice prevails over the possibility of truth (I do not say that this is such a case), and these are cases where the law insists on finality. For a policy of closure to be compatible with justice, it must be attended with safeguards: so the law allows appeals: so the law, exceptionally, allows appeals out of time: so the law still more exceptionally allows judgments to be attacked on the ground of fraud: so limitation periods may, exceptionally, be extended. But these are exceptions to a general rule of high public importance, and as all the cases show, they are reserved for rare and limited cases, where the facts justifying them can be strictly proved."</p>

In particular I was unsure that Dr W had any research basis for his assertions about the degree of force required to cause bruises of the kind suffered by C. However, there is no evidence to contradict what Dr W says. His invitation to anybody who doubts him to try causing a bruise to himself may appear to be a trivial or facile answer, but it is a good way of demonstrating something which cannot be explained in words. </p>

This was not over the jawbone or the cheekbone. Considerable force must have been required to cause these bruises. There is no way in which that could conceivably happen accidentally. In particular, holding the face to insert eye-drops, or to assist a doctor&#8217;s examination, or bumping against Father&#8217;s chest, or scratching with the baby&#8217;s fingernails, or any other suggestion for an accidental cause must be rejected. None of them would involve the application of sufficient force to cause bruising. Pinching with the thumb and foref&#8204;inger of an adult hand would be one way of doing it. Since no accidental cause can be conceived of, on the balance of probabilities I conclude that the bruises to both checks were non-accidental.&#8221;</p>

Finally, in relation to bruising, I note that the platelets reading for C was 579 on the 5.1.16 and 771 on the 10 January 2016, where the normal range is 150-450. In his report, Dr W states at paragraph 104, that an &#8220;elevated platelet count can cause abnormal bleeding or bruising&#8221;, but then does not go on to consider how this may have been applicable in C&#8217;s case in particular given the increase in the levels from 5-10 January. At paragraph 131 of his report he simply states it is a common finding in babies with infection and it &#8220;cannot cause easy or abnormal bruising&#8221;. He does not however state in terms that C&#8217;s bruising was either &#8220;easy&#8221; or &#8220;abnormal&#8221;. By the time of the 10 January reading, C had been treated with antibiotics at least since the procedure on the 4.1.16. For her to be still suffering from the effects of infection by the 10.01.16 with no medical staff making reference to this, seems a little strange. The issue of the raised platelets at the material time is therefore unresolved.&#8221; </p>

If that were the case then by the 26.01.16 what would be seen would not be early callus formation but callus bridging the fracture site and remodelling of the primary callus. Indeed, if the fracture was as early as the 31.12.15, what may have been seen on the 26.01.16 was formation of lamellar bone. Instead, what was identified by Dr W as &#8220;early callus&#8221; is seen between 0-14 days in histopathology, which comfortably dates back to the fracture having occurred on the 11.01.16.&#8217;</p>

The paper cannot cast doubt on the conclusions drawn by the experts and the court at the hearing from the available radiological evidence. </p>

The letter states that the review team would have expected the court to have &#8216;considered&#8217; tests for a metabolic bone disease. But the issue of a metabolic bone disease was specifically addressed in the evidence of Dr W. Dr W set out the considerations in respect of a metabolic bone disease and concluded:</p>

She does not have a history of other previous or subsequent fractures and I have not been provided with a history of a close relative with an inherited disorder causing easy or abnormal fracturing of bones. C&#8217;s metabolic blood tests included a bone profile that showed normal calcium, phosphate and alkaline phosphatase levels. The normal alkaline phosphatase level excludes Ricketts as a possible cause of her fractures and this conclusion is supported by the finding of a normal vitamin D level. All this information makes it highly unlikely that C has an acquired or inherited disorder that caused or contributed to her clavicle and rib fractures. &#8221;</p>

The finding was made after the Recorder heard, and assessed the veracity of, the oral evidence of the actors. The Raynor paper does not provide any grounds, let alone solid grounds, to lead to a belief that the forensic process in relation to that issue should be allowed to be re-run 5 years after the event when memories will no doubt have seriously faded. If that were allowed to happen it would amount to the relevant actors being grossly twice vexed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There is no care order in respect of C. Her grandmother, as special guardian, has enhanced parental responsibility under sec 14C(1)(b) of the Children Act 1989. It would have been possible for the special guardian to have arranged for tests to be performed on C to determine if she in fact suffers from OI. This was not done. Instead, the mother has applied, as stated above, for a paediatrician to undertake a comprehensive examination of C and to opine as to the cause of the relevant injuries and, inferentially, whether that cause was OI. This course, which one might describe as being Micawberish - hoping that something will turn up - simply cannot fit with either the general law, or even a most liberal interpretation of Jackson LJ&#8217;s solid grounds test. Under the general law the applicant seeking to relitigate an issue decided adversely first time round has to demonstrate special circumstances, and those special circumstances will be, as Lord Cairns said, where additional facts have emerged which entirely change the aspect of the case about the rib-fracture and which could not with reasonable diligence have been ascertained before. To make an application without such evidence in the hope that the court will authorise expert evidence which may, or may not, turn something up which casts doubt on the original findings is completely the wrong way of formulating a challenge. The very process adopted of itself demonstrates that the applicant does not have any solid grounds.</p>

In this case the applicant is not seeking to disturb the special guardianship order. At its highest, the mother&#8217;s objective is to obtain a finding which in effect exonerates her so that she can unassailably argue that her contact to her daughter should be unsupervised and over-night. I have to say that this &#8216;pool&#8217; finding against the mother over 5 years ago is unlikely to be of any great weight in the implausible event that the mother were to start fresh private law proceedings against her own mother for enlarged contact. The relationship between the mother and her own mother is entirely felicitous. I can see why the mother wants from a moral viewpoint to expunge the stigma of the adverse finding, but this would not in my judgment be a good reason to undo the finality of these long closed proceedings.</p>

It can, apparently, act as a makeweight with other evidence, although I have to say that I cannot understand why the dissenting reasoning of Lord Wilson (supported by Lord Sumption) in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (Children) (Care Proceedings: Threshold Criteria)</span>at [80] is not correct:</p>

In 2016 testing would only be done if a child were presenting clinical signs of the condition. Now, testing would be done, it would seem, based on mere suspicion. In medicine, standards are changing continuously. Yesterday&#8217;s standard practices can become tomorrow&#8217;s heresies. The spurious aging of bruises technique is a classic example. The court cannot contemplate cases being reopened years after closure in reliance on such changes unless the previous practice is now shown to be not merely arguably unsafe, but completely and categorically wrong.</p>
