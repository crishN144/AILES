The injuries consisted of injuries to the brain, spinal cord and eyes consistent with shaking, a 13cm skull fracture that was several days old at the time of death, and rib fractures of different ages.  I found that both parents knew that A had suffered a head injury leading to swelling some days before her death, both had lied and failed to protect her, and failed to seek medical treatment for her. In those circumstances where both parents displayed similar thinking I found it was not possible to identify who was the perpetrator. I stated that, given the attitude of the parents it could be a case where both parents had inflicted injuries.</span></p>

By then both parents had been charged with murder and had been remanded in custody.  In June 2023 the mother pleaded guilty to manslaughter. She stated that she had shaken A on several occasions when suffering from post-natal depression and in a state of serious stress. She also stated that she could have dropped her from a height. Her plea was accepted and in December 2023 the mother was sentenced to three and a half years imprisonment. She was released in the light of the time she had spent on remand.</span></p>

There must be solid grounds for believing that the earlier findings require revisiting.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8221;</span></p>

Additionally, the court would have to consider the inherent unlikelihood that a child would be injured by both parents as opposed to one. On the other hand, at the fact finding hearing I noted that the parents appeared to have similar thinking and that this might be one of those unusual cases where both parents were responsible for injuring A.  I would consider that a re-opening of the findings as to the earlier injures could lead to a more precise factual outcome in that it is possible that the mother would be found responsible for causing all the injuries, but that is by no means certain.</span></p>

I recognise that the path to this proposed adoption has not been smooth (and is still not guaranteed) but the effect of further delay on F is something that carries very significant weight in my decision.  Mr Jarman submitted to me that the effect of delay on F in this case was not as significant as it might be because there is no suggestion that she would move from her foster carer whilst the investigation is carried out.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In coming to this decision I appreciate the father will be extremely disappointed. I have said some hard things about him, but I do wish to emphasize that this is not the whole picture. I have considerable sympathy for the position that both parents found themselves in after the twins were born, shortly after the outbreak of the pandemic.  They were both isolated, the father was working hard to earn money for the family, and their circumstances would have been difficult for anyone to cope with. By this application the father has shown his commitment to F and I do not doubt that he and the mother continue to love her.  In time she will know that and it will help her come to terms with what has happened.  Nonetheless, I am clear that this application should be refused for all the reasons I have set out.</span></p>
