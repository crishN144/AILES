	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned in this case with RS who is 25 years of age and who has intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.  These challenges have led to RS having behavioural and emotional difficulties.  He lives with his mother who is the first respondent in these proceedings.  Also sharing the home are six of RS&#8217;s seven siblings.  During the course of this hearing I heard evidence from members of RS&#8217;s family.  It is important that I preface this judgment by signalling that it is entirely plain to me that RS is greatly loved by his family and that their actions have been motivated by a determination to ensure that he is cared for and protected throughout his life. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not necessary for me to rehearse the background of RS&#8217;s life extensively; I simply highlight a number of incidents which help to provide some context to the issues in the case generally.  In 2007 when RS was 18 years old, his mother (M) informed the Social Services Department that her son was displaying what is described as inappropriate sexual and aggressive behaviour.  There is a record that M speculated at that time that marriage might assist her son.  The Local Authority record that M was advised against marriage by the Specialist Medical Services.  At that stage RS&#8217;s behaviour caused concern both for his own safety and that of any potential spouse.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2008 RS was placed in a residential unit in Stoke-on-Trent.  All agree that this arrangement came about because his behaviour at home had become unmanageable.  In her evidence to me M spoke of this period with evident distress.  She told me that this had been a difficult time for her personally, that she had felt very guilty about these arrangements and the fact that neither she nor any other members of the family had been able to visit RS regularly in the four years that he remained a resident at the unit.  She told me that in the summer of 2012, as I understand her evidence, RS returned for a home visit with a damaged and swollen hand, which injury he had sustained when lashing out at a door.  The hand, M told me, looked very painful and RS said that he had behaved in that way out of frustration for being locked up for too long.  M also considered that the drugs regime at the unit had made her son &#8216;like a Zombie&#8217;, as she put it, &#8216;for long periods of time&#8217;.</p>

Although RS has been seen periodically by Dr. Iqbal (Consultant Psychiatrist) there appears to be no further incident of sexually inappropriate behaviour since returning home.  However, I note that Dr. Iqbal records, in December 2013, that RS &#8216;makes socially unacceptable comments and also displays embarrassing behaviour such as crying and speaking loudly&#8217;.  M reported that RS was very attentive to his personal hygiene; likes things to be in order and has a very good memory.  However, he had difficulty sleeping and tended to stay awake until the middle of the night.  In December 2013 M said that she found him difficult to manage at weekends and in the evenings because he tended to be very loud and needed constant attention and supervision.  She told me during the week RS has support from care assistants. He tended to repeat questions but, conversely, did not like to be asked questions himself or to take any requests from M.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Shastri, Associate Specialist Psychiatrist, prescribed Risperidone to decrease agitation and sleep disturbance.  I should also add that the medical records reveal RS to have gained a significant amount of weight.  At this time he weighed 129Kg with a BMI 36.5.  M told me in evidence that she has successfully weaned her son off his medication, albeit without medical advice.  In the last two years M reports RS as having settled and matured.  M denies that RS exhibits any sexually inappropriate behaviour and describes him as gentle and kind.  The social worker is sceptical as to the accuracy of this information and suggests that there have been some signs that RS continues to display worrying traits, such as touching the head and face of females he does not know well.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In evidence I also heard from RS&#8217;s sister (SB) and his uncle (Z).  They both were at pains to emphasise how they considered that RS had developed into a delightful, gentle and essentially placid man.  They considered that it was family members who were best able to evaluate the strengths and potential of RS.  Doctors and Social Workers, who saw RS infrequently or for narrow periods of assessment, they felt simply did not have the real opportunity fully to appreciate the depth and strength of RS&#8217;s personality.  I find that, at times, this family may have consciously exaggerated the extent of RS&#8217;s real potential but for the most part I think they genuinely focus on RS&#8217;s strengths rather than dwelling on his disadvantages.  M told me that quite recently RS had managed to purchase a bag of lentils from the local corner shop entirely without assistance.  She told me that she had given him the exact money and a nearly empty bag of lentils to take with him to assist him in this exchange.  Her pride in her son&#8217;s accomplishment was both obvious and genuine, it was also difficult to reconcile with the more competent picture of her son she was seeking to put before the court.  M believed, she told me, that RS could maintain and support his wife.  </p>

In March 2014 a FACE profile was undertaken.  This is an assessment tool to evaluate the level of support required to promote independence.  Again I propose to record features of it which help to give context to the central issues:</p>

In addition Dr. Iqbal has provided three short reports in October 2014.  There is agreement on the central issues between the doctors but, as it is Dr. Carpenter who has been instructed as an expert in this case and he who has extensively reviewed the background history, it is his conclusions I evaluate.  He considers that RS &#8216;undoubtedly has intellectual disability&#8217;.  Drawing on the practical skills described by M, which I have already intimated may sometimes overstate her son&#8217;s potential, Dr. Carpenter considers RS to be operating <span style="font-weight:bold">practically</span> [my emphasis] at the level of a 5-8 year old, indicating &#8216;moderate learning disability&#8217;.  This, considers Dr. Carpenter, is verified by the FACE assessment I have summarised above.  There is no formal IQ assessment, it is thought likely that this would prove to be too difficult to undertake because it would require a level of concentration that RS would struggle with.  In relation to RS&#8217;s autism Dr. Carpenter concludes:</p>

As part of this he has a typical autistic spread of skills. He has learnt to be cooperative (to a point). He can learn simple practical skills and short sequences by rote [washing, dressing] - including I believe, writing his name. He has less ability to think about the abstract side of things such as time and numbers and future consequences. His practical and rote skills can lead one to overestimate his abstract thinking skills.</span></p>

In a somewhat circular way, this is also part of the autistic nature of his interaction and understanding others.  Accordingly, said Dr Carpenter, not only does RS struggle to absorb abstract concepts but he does not have an effective way to signal his difficulty or distress. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Addressing the first issue in this litigation, namely whether RS has the capacity to consent to sexual intercourse, Dr Carpenter concluded that he did not.  He considered that due to the combination of autism and intellectual disability RS could not weigh the risks or consequences of infection nor could he absorb the concept of pregnancy, birth and sexual intercourse as intrinsically connected events.  Consistently with this, whilst RS understood how to use a condom, he could not connect that with the prevention of pregnancy.  Indeed, as I understood Dr. Carpenter&#8217;s evidence, the purpose of contraception was simply too complex for RS to grasp.  On each aspect of the recognised markers of understanding sexual intercourse RS displayed some knowledge.  He identified infection as a risk of sex, he understood that babies resulted from sexual intercourse and he understood the mechanics of the sexual act.  I am told that the marriage has been consummated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">RS has not received any sexual education. He has however received some information about sex via the friendship and support of a caring uncle (Z) from the north of England.  Z told me, with great candour, that he and RS had discussed women and sex together when RS had spent some time with him in his shop.  RS demonstrated to Z that he knew how to use a condom by applying it to a banana.  The two men, Z told me, had watched pornography together.  Z considered that RS had the capacity to consent to sexual relations, though I consider that he wished to conceal some of his nephew&#8217;s limitations.  In what I suspect was an unguarded moment, he told me that RS had sex once.  When I pressed him on this because, on M&#8217;s case, sexual intercourse had taken place on a number of occasions, he said that he had intended to refer to the honeymoon generally rather than a single occasion.  Perhaps because his evidence was otherwise so frank and clear this confusion struck me as unlikely.  I strongly suspect that intercourse has indeed only taken place on the one occasion.  That said, I make no determination on the point.</p>

Z volunteered in evidence, by way of example, how RS had managed to learn to sweep the floor effectively at his barber&#8217;s shop (by repeat example), having struggled initially.  This simple illustration, like so many others given by M, exactly reinforces the assessment of Dr. Carpenter.  Thus my conclusions in relation to RS&#8217;s style of interaction and understanding of others rests not only on the expert evidence but on the broader canvass of the evidence as a whole.  </p>

However, whilst the family identify individual aspects of RS&#8217;s knowledge rather than a coherent overall understanding, Dr. Carpenter considers that the combination of autism and intellectual disability prevents RS from making the crucial link between actions and consequences thus establishing a unifying analysis for his overall behaviour.   In his report Dr. Carpenter observes:</p>

Z also told me that RS knew about infection, though was never able to make the connection between sex and disease.  In short, as the family talked about RS on a practical level their accounts again resonated very closely with Dr. Carpenter&#8217;s assessment.  Dr. Carpenter concluded, on the balance of probabilities that RS did not know the risk of intercourse except possibly the words &#8216;baby&#8217; and &#8216;infection&#8217;.  Neither did Dr. Carpenter consider that RS understood the concept of fidelity, an assessment which, in my judgement, was not made in response to one short question but on the broader basis of his assessment as a whole.  Predicating his analysis on the relationship between RS&#8217;s moderate learning disability and autism, Dr. Carpenter concluded that RS does not have capacity to consent to sexual intercourse and given, on the chronology of the case, that RS was more likely to have gained rather than lost capacity during the course of the previous 12 months, he would therefore not have had capacity for intercourse in October/ November 2014 (i.e. at the time of the marriage in Pakistan).  I accept Dr. Carpenter&#8217;s conclusion not least because, as I have emphasised, it fits closely with key aspects of the family&#8217;s own evidence. </p>

Importantly, it is not enough that an individual appreciates that he or she is taking part in a marriage ceremony or understands its words.  He or she must understand both the nature of the marriage contract and the duties and responsibilities which normally attach to marriage (see para 141 vi and vii).  In the light of what I have discussed above it is, in my judgement, very clear that RS has no significant grasp of the role of husband and wife or the duties of either.  Whatever the differing cultural considerations to be taken into account here, it seems to me that mutuality, reciprocity and the capacity for compromise are indivisible components of marriage.  The test of understanding seems to me to be succinctly identified by Munby J in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re E (supra)</span>:</p>

His particular combination of disabilities leading to what is described as his &#8216;concrete perspective&#8217; on life renders him unable to grasp, either emotionally or intellectually, these kinds of responsibilities.  Neither can RS truly comprehend the continuous nature of the marriage contract itself.

This feature of his functioning really, to my mind, as Dr. Carpenter concludes, precludes RS from &#8216;understanding&#8217; rather than &#8216;reciting&#8217; concepts.

Dr. Carpenter did not hear the evidence which succeeded his own, to the effect that RS sometimes watched pornography.  I doubt very much whether that would have surprised Dr. Carpenter or made any difference to his conclusions but on this point (i.e. potential for sex education work) and for the future I would not regard the point as settled. It may have to be reviewed in due course.  That said, and I emphasise, it is unlikely to have any bearing on capacity.</p>

Her submissions are succinct and attractively presented.  Whilst she concedes that this Court has discretion whether to make a declaration of non recognition of a foreign marriage, she submits that the public policy priority weighs so heavily that it overwhelms the balancing exercise.  If the Court declares that RS lacks capacity to marry it follows axiomatically, Ms Hearnden argues, that the marriage could not lawfully have been conducted in England and Wales.  The fact the marriage is formally valid in Pakistan, an unchallenged fact in this case, should not encourage an English Court to recognise a marriage which offends a key contractual component, namely consent.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In summary, Ms. Hearnden contends that there are sound reasons why marital unions in which one party lacks the capacity to consent should be deterred.  Many such marriages will be abusive and exploitative.  Even should I find this not to be the case here, Ms. Hearnden submits &#8216;there is no utility to RS maintaining the pretence of a marriage in which he can not lawfully have a sexual relationship with his wife&#8217;.  It is certainly difficult to see how it could be respectful to the dignity of either of the parties to this union to blight their relationship with the permanent threat of a criminal prosecution.  I am, of course, only concerned with RS.  The arrangement however, I agree is a precarious foundation for family life as well as demeaning to the parties.  Of course, whether such a relationship lacking, as I have found it to, mutuality, reciprocity and a proper consensual contractual basis, falls within even the wide embrace of the concept of family life in Article 8, ECHR may very well be moot.

M, in particular, had been shocked and disturbed by her son&#8217;s isolation and unhappiness in the residential unit.  She found it difficult to manage her distress as she told me about this period in her son&#8217;s life.  As the records at the time reveal, even then, M contemplated marriage as a solution for her son&#8217;s predicament.  I think that she considered the options for her son&#8217;s future and found them, by the standards of her hopes and expectations as a mother, to be bleak.</p>

I have seen the wedding photographs, bound in red leather with gold lettering.  The occasion was extravagant, the costumes striking.  There was much gold in evidence.  Z told me it was &#8216;all very bling&#8217; and had cost the family something in the region of &#163;25,000. It is clear that no expense was spared on the bride either, her costumes were lavish and impressive.  A wedding on this scale, I was told, signalled status and position.  RS&#8217;s family are well regarded in Kashmir.  Mr K, a close family friend for some fifteen years here in the UK, was able to attend the wedding ceremony, the various pre wedding ceremonies and the post wedding reception.  He told me that W and RS were positive and happy and that W was sensitive and thoughtful to her husband.  RS, he told me, selected his own colourful clothes.</p>

He said the Imam also asked RS &#8216;do you know why you are here? To which he reports &#8216;RS confirmed that he was here to marry&#8217;.  The Imam then asked whether RS was happy &#8216;to get married with W&#8217;.  The response was &#8216;yes&#8217;. The Nikkah, the formal ceremony took place at the home of W&#8217;s father.  This ceremony was only for the immediate family and took place in a specific room with around 7 to 10 people present.  Later that day there were 100 guests at the home and the following week a further party in which 500 guests attended.  The family have all confirmed this account.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her evidence to me W was respectful to the family, to her husband and to the Court.  I formed the impression that she had made a utilitarian calculation of her own interests in this marriage.  From a purely western perspective that might appear to be a critical observation.  I do not intend it to be regarded as such.  W has different cultural expectations; social priorities which are influenced by her upbringing in Kashmir and by her own understandings of the responsibilities and obligations expected of women in her society.  She was articulate in her assertion that she had entered this marriage of her own free will.  Despite the highly personal nature of the inevitable and proper questions she confirmed with some robustness, that the marriage had been consummated.  She also told me that at the time of her menstruation her new husband had shown sensitivity and forbearance.   In short, I have absolutely no sense that she had entered this marriage under duress or in consequence of any abusive pressure.  On her part I am entirely satisfied that she gave free consent.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These two important early cases in the Strasbourg jurisprudence foreshadowed the evolution of a body of case law which has consistently emphasised the importance of autonomy; development of psychological and moral integrity and relationships with other human beings as key aspects of individual human rights.  Ultimately however, I have come to the conclusion that capacity, at least in the circumstances here, is an intrinsic, indivisible facet of both psychological and moral integrity.  The absence of RS&#8217;s capacity to consent either to sexual relations or to marriage ultimately compromises the ability of this couple to forge the mutual and reciprocal commitment which, in my judgement, is an essential component of a marriage, perhaps even universally so.  </p>

W will have rights to any property RS may inherit or otherwise acquire.  If there are children RS will automatically have &#8216;parental responsibility&#8217;, the obligations of which he is unlikely to be able to discharge.  As Ms. Hearnden puts it in her closing submission &#8216;for as long as the marriage remains untouched, he is exposed to legal obligations and consequences which he does not understand and has not voluntarily assumed&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In most cases an overseas marriage, entered into by an individual who lacks capacity to consent to either sexual relations or marriage, is likely to require the Court to make a declaration of non recognition.  (There will be more direct remedies in the case of a marriage contracted in the UK).  However, it overstates the position to regard the discretionary exercise here as essentially &#8216;illusory&#8217;.  Whilst I am not prepared to predict the circumstances in which the discretion might be exercised, neither am I prepared to say that a Court is never likely to do so.  The interests of justice, fairness and respect for different aspects of individual autonomy may, in certain circumstances prevail.  That said, those circumstances are likely to arise very rarely indeed.  They have not done so here.</p>
