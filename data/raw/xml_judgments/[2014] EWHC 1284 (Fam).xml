It held that in doing so it would be artificial top ignore the benefits which would accrue from a change in immigration status and that first consideration had to be given to the welfare benefits of making the adoption order even if these included the acquisition of British citizenship. The conferment of nationality, as a result of an adoption order being made, was part of the welfare landscape that the court had to consider when determining whether to make an adoption or not.  </span></p>

Particularly when looking at the alternative age which during the relevant period he would have been between 22 and 25.  It is highly unlikely, in my judgment, that there would have been a growth of 20cm in height between those ages, and it is much more likely that that growth in height would have taken place between the ages of 15 and 17.</span></p>
