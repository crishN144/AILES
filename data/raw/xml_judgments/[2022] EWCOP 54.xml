Dr K, who had been M&#8217;s treating psychiatrist since 2019, quickly reinforced the need for daily morning and evening visits for medication to prevent relapse and for independent oversight of the provision of medication. The presence of carers has been problematic throughout and I will return to this later.</p>

The order recites that Dr A requested the replacement of the solicitor instructed on behalf of M for &#8220;harassing&#8221; M and the family. The court reminded Dr A that M was entitled to his benefit money and that the local authority needed to know for what M needed money to make sure appropriate funds were on the card. Dr A declined to sign on M&#8217;s behalf to receive the payment card. The court confirmed the previous penal notice and considered the applications by Dr A to replace M&#8217;s legal team and to remove the local authority as appointee.

He was able to clearly and consistently express his thoughts, wishes and feelings. M expressed himself verbally with a high level of confidence; however his voice is completely drowned out by his family and Dr A. He has the ability but not the opportunity to express his wishes and feelings.  Any opinion he has expressed is because he has been influenced to do so. This is not necessarily to indicate malign intent, but there is clear and consistent evidence over many years the family have not always been able to identify and prioritise M&#8217;s needs. Dr K comes to the same conclusion. </p>

He had no difficulty in following and contributing to our discussion.  He was enthusiastic and wants to better himself. He is an accomplished artist, using pencil and pen, a drawer rather than a painter. He is a keen musician and plays the guitar. He teaches himself and loves tinkering with machines, not to a very advanced level, but he likes screwing/unscrewing, and turning switches on and off. These are hobbies that he has picked up from his father. </p>

Ms J started her work in February 2022, as did Dr Camden-Smith. Both began by hoping that it might be possible to keep M at home and to give M the opportunity to embrace new opportunities and accept more support. Dr Camden-Smith said in February that moving M from his family home by force would be damaging and detrimental to his mental health, that he was happy and settled at home and takes pride in supporting his mother. However, she shared concerns with the local authority about safety in the family home if not supervised. It was crucial that paid support workers and professionals continue to provide daily supervision and medication and that M would benefit enormously from attending a day centre. </p>

Other occupants are not disruptive and it is much less regimented than PH. It is an 18 minute walk from the family home and considerably less on the bus. The local authority has a reserve alternative if M, on visiting EL, found staff there that he had an aversion to from PH. No one would want M to be faced with a staff member with whom he was uncomfortable.</p>
