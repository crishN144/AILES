	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case raises important questions about the extent to which the public should be able to read and see what disgruntled parents say when they speak out about what they see as deficiencies in the family justice system, particularly when, as here, their complaints are about the care system. The case also raises important questions about how the court should adapt its practice to the realities of the internet, and in particular social media. For these reasons I am giving this judgment in open court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother and the father have had four children: L, born in November 2002, C, born in November 2008, W, born in April 2012, and J, born in April 2013. All four children have been the subject of care proceedings. The proceedings in relation to L and C were commenced in October 2010 and concluded with the making of care and placement orders in May 2011. Both children have since been adopted. W was made the subject of an emergency protection order on the day of birth. Care and placement orders were made in November 2012. J was made the subject of an emergency protection order on the day of birth. The care proceedings have not yet concluded but are likely to do so shortly. </p>

The father has posted much material about them on the internet, including their names and photographs. The day after W&#8217;s birth the father posted on Facebook photographs of W and of a social worker, who was named, taken the day before in the hospital delivery suite. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A feature of these postings was the use by the father of language which on occasions was abusive, insulting, threatening and, indeed, highly offensive. Images of L and C posted in February 2012 were accompanied by the comment that each was worth &#163;200,000 to the forced adoption system. The image of W posted in April 2012 was accompanied by text referring to the child as having been &#8220;snatched from the delivery suite by Staffordshire County Council.&#8221; The image of the social worker was accompanied by the caption &#8220;This is the picture of [name] social worker waiting in delivery suite to snatch child.&#8221; A copy of a letter written by the local authority to the father was posted by him on Facebook in May 2012; the accompanying text referred to the social worker in these terms:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">J was born at home on 4 April 2013, the local authority says against medical advice. The father announced J&#8217;s birth on Facebook. It included these words: &#8220;SS banging on the door we&#8217;re not answering&#8221; and &#8220;ss gone to get epo&#8221;. I very much doubt that &#8216;SS&#8217; was here being used as an innocent acronym for the local authority&#8217;s social services. The internet is awash with strident criticism of local authorities, described as &#8220;the SS&#8221; or &#8220;SS&#8221;, where it is quite clear from the context that the reader is meant to link the activities of the local authorities being criticised with those of Hitler&#8217;s infamous SS. The comparison is grotesque and is, and I have little doubt is intended to be, offensive and insulting &#8211; grossly so. I make no such finding against the father in relation to this particular publication but I am willing to proceed on the assumption, though without finding, that the father&#8217;s intent was indeed to encourage readers to make the comparison.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Subsequently the father posted on Facebook what the local authority says was the &#8220;covert&#8221; filming of the execution of the emergency protection order later the same day. J was referred to by name. The next day, 5 April 2013, it was picked up by a website called UK Column Live, which published it via You Tube. It has subsequently been much &#8216;shared&#8217; on Facebook. Two days later, UK Column Live filmed an interview with the father which it uploaded to You Tube on 11 April 2013. The father and the mother are referred to by name. On 12 April 2013 the father gave an undertaking to remove all the material posted on the internet and within his control that would identify any of the children as being or having been subject to care proceedings. On 1 May 2013 he further undertook to use his best endeavours to secure removal of such material from the internet. Footage of an interview with the parents in the precincts of the court on that occasion was subsequently put on the internet by UK Column Live. W and J were identified by name. Further orders were made on 10 May 2013.</p>

On 19 June 2013 the father appeared before His Honour Judge Orrell (the details can be found on BAILII). He admitted breaches of the order and undertaking and was sentenced to six weeks&#8217; imprisonment for each breach. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently but were suspended on condition that he complied with the various orders and undertakings. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I need not go further into the facts. Unchallenged evidence from the local authority shows that, although some of it has been removed (in part by the father), material about J, as also about the other children, remains on the internet. Of particular concern to the local authority are two sites: Facebook, which is based in California, and UK Column Live, which is based in Plymouth.</p>

The local authority was represented by Mr Alistair MacDonald QC and Ms Julie Moseley. The Children&#8217;s Guardian had filed a position statement, confirming his support of the local authority&#8217;s application and saying that he shares the local authority&#8217;s concerns regarding the father&#8217;s use of the internet to publicise and disseminate information regarding the current care proceedings, J and the other children. Appropriately the guardian was neither present nor represented, though his solicitor held a watching brief on his behalf. The mother was neither present nor represented, though her solicitors had written to the court saying that she did not oppose the local authority&#8217;s application and was in agreement with it. The father was neither present nor represented and had seemingly not engaged with the process at all. There was likewise no attendance by or on behalf of any of the media or any internet website.</p>

Section 97 prohibits the publication of &#8220;material which is intended, or likely, to identify&#8221; the child. But this prohibition comes to an end once the proceedings have been concluded: <span style="font-style:italic">Clayton v Clayton </span>[2006] EWCA Civ 878, [2006] Fam 83, [2007] 1 FLR 11. Section 12 does not protect the identity of anyone involved in the proceedings, not even the child: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child) (Disclosure) </span>[2004] EWHC 411 (Fam), [2004] 2 FLR 142, para [82], <span style="font-style:italic">A v Ward</span> [2010] EWHC 16 Fam), [2010] 1 FLR 1497, para [79], <span style="font-style:italic">In re X and others (Children) (Morgan and others intervening) </span>[2011] EWHC 1157 (Fam), [2012] 1 WLR 182, sub nom <span style="font-style:italic">Re X, Y and Z (Expert Witness)</span>, [2011] 2 FLR 1437, para [32].

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court has power both to relax and to add to the &#8216;automatic restraints.&#8217; In exercising this jurisdiction the court must conduct the &#8216;balancing exercise&#8217; described in <span style="font-style:italic">In re S (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) </span>[2004] UKHL 47, [2005] 1 AC 593, [2005] 1 FLR 591, and in <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v W, L, W, T and R (by the Children&#8217;s Guardian) </span>[2005] EWHC 1564 (Fam), [2006] 1 FLR 1. This necessitates what Lord Steyn in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span>, para [17], called &#8220;an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case&#8221;. There are, typically, a number of competing interests engaged, protected by Articles 6, 8 and 10 of the Convention. I incorporate in this judgment, without further elaboration or quotation, the analyses which I set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child) (Disclosure)</span> [2004] EWHC 411 (Fam), [2004] 2 FLR 142, at para [93], and in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Webster; Norfolk County Council v Webster and Others</span> [2006] EWHC 2733 (Fam), [2007] 1 FLR 1146, at para [80]. As Lord Steyn pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span>, para [25], it is &#8220;necessary to measure the nature of the impact &#8230; on the child&#8221; of what is in prospect. Indeed, the interests of the child, although not paramount, must be a primary consideration, that is, they must be considered first though they can, of course, be outweighed by the cumulative effect of other considerations: <span style="font-style:italic">ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2011] UKSC 4, [2011] 2 AC 166, para [33].</p>

Such injunctions, however, will not readily be granted: see the discussions in <span style="font-style:italic">A v Ward</span> [2010] EWHC 16 Fam), [2010] 1 FLR 1497, and <span style="font-style:italic">In re X and others (Children) (Morgan and others intervening) </span>[2011] EWHC 1157 (Fam), [2012] 1 WLR 182, sub nom <span style="font-style:italic">Re X, Y and Z (Expert Witness)</span>, [2011] 2 FLR 1437. As I put it in <span style="font-style:italic">A v Ward</span>, para [181], any such application in relation to an expert or a social worker must be justified by reference to &#8220;the particular circumstances or particular vulnerabilities of specific individuals.&#8221; What I referred to as a &#8216;class&#8217; claim, that is, &#8220;a claim that any professional who falls into a certain class &#8211; and in the case of &#8230; social workers &#8230; the membership of the class is very large indeed &#8211; is, for that reason, and, truth be told, for that reason alone, entitled in current circumstances to have their identity protected, in plain language to have their identity concealed from the public&#8221;, will not succeed.

Nowhere is this more necessary than in relation to care and adoption cases. Such cases, by definition, involve interference, intrusion, by the state, by local authorities and by the court, into family life. In this context the arguments in favour of publicity &#8211; in favour of openness, public scrutiny and public accountability &#8211; are particularly compelling. The public generally, and not just the professional readers of law reports or similar publications, have a legitimate, indeed a compelling, interest in knowing how the family courts exercise their care jurisdiction: <span style="font-style:italic">Re X; London Borough of Barnet v Y and X</span> [2006] 2 FLR 998, para [166]. </p>

When a family judge makes a placement order or an adoption order in relation to a twenty-year old mother&#8217;s baby, the mother will have to live with the consequences of that decision for what may be upwards of 60 or even 70 years, and the baby for what may be upwards of 80 or even 90 years. We must be vigilant to guard against the risks.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This takes me on to the next point. We strive to avoid miscarriages of justice, but human justice is inevitably fallible. The <span style="font-style:italic">Oldham</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Webster </span>cases stand as terrible warning to everyone involved in the family justice system, the latter as stark illustration of the fact that a miscarriage of justice which comes to light only after the child has been adopted will very probably be irremediable: <span style="font-style:italic">W v Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 1247, [2006] 1 FLR 543, <span style="font-style:italic">Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council v GW &amp; PW</span> [2007] EWHC 136 (Fam), [2007] 2 FLR 597, and <span style="font-style:italic">Webster v Norfolk County Council and the Children (By Their Children&#8217;s Guardian)</span> [2009] EWCA Civ 59, [2009] 1 FLR 1378. Of course, as Wall LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Webster</span>, para [197], &#8220;the system provides a remedy. It requires determined lawyers and determined parties.&#8221; So, as I entirely agree, the role of specialist family counsel is vital in ensuring that justice is done and that so far as possible miscarriages of justice are prevented. But that, if I may say so with all respect to my predecessor, is only part of the remedy. We must have the humility to recognise &#8211; and to acknowledge &#8211; that public debate, and the jealous vigilance of an informed media, have an important role to play in exposing past miscarriages of justice and in preventing possible future miscarriages of justice.</p>

There is a clear and obvious public interest in maintaining the confidence of the public at large in the courts. It is vitally important, if the administration of justice is to be promoted and public confidence in the courts maintained, that justice be administered in public &#8211; or at least in a manner which enables its workings to be properly scrutinised &#8211; so that the judges and other participants in the process remain visible and amenable to comment and criticism. This principle, as the Strasbourg court has repeatedly reiterated, is protected by both Article 6 and Article 10 of the Convention. It is a principle of particular importance in the context of care and other public law cases.</p>

Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed. It is not for the court to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists. Article 10 entitles journalists to adopt a particular form of presentation intended to ensure a particularly telling effect on the average reader. As Neill LJ recognised [in <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (Wardship: Publication of Information)</span> [1992] 1 FLR 99] a tabloid newspaper is entitled to tell the story in a manner which will engage the interest of its readers and the general public.&#8221;</p>

It suffices for present purposes to make three points, building on what Tugendhat J said in <span style="font-style:italic">MXB v East Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust </span>[2012] EWHC 3279 (QB), para [11]. First, the internet allows anyone, effectively at the click of a mouse, to publish whatever they wish to the entire world &#8211; or at least to everyone who has access to the internet. No longer does the campaigner have to persuade a publisher, newspaper or broadcaster to disseminate the message. So there is very little editorial control. The consequence is that the internet is awash with material couched in the most exaggerated, extreme, offensive and often defamatory terms, much of which has only a tenuous connection with objectively verifiable truth. Second, material once placed on the internet remains there indefinitely and, because of powerful search engines, is easily accessible by anyone wanting to track it down. Third, internet providers are often located outside the jurisdiction, in countries where practical difficulties or principled objections stand in the way of enforcing orders of this court.</p>

The orders do not operate directly upon the property, let alone in rem &#8230; it must always be borne in mind that there is a crucial difference between the existence of jurisdiction, in the sense of the competence of the court to make orders, and the question whether the jurisdiction should in fact be exercised in a given case as a matter of discretion. Thus, it is a fundamental principle that, in the exercise of their discretion, our courts will not make orders which they cannot enforce. It follows, as shown by the cases, that in relation to property situated abroad, even if the parties are present within the jurisdiction, the courts will in general not make any order the effectiveness of which depends upon its recognition or enforcement by the courts or other authorities of the foreign locus if the evidence shows that these would be denied. However, such cases go to discretion and not to jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>

For the same reason the court would no doubt refuse to set aside a disposition of foreign land under section 37(2)(b) of the Act of 1973 if the evidence showed that under the foreign law or for some other reason the order would be ineffective. Again, however, this does not by itself affect the existence of the jurisdiction, ie the competence of the court to consider whether or not its jurisdiction should be exercised in the circumstances.&#8221;</p>

An injunction should not, therefore, be granted to impose an obligation to do something which is impossible or cannot be enforced. The injunction must serve a useful purpose for the person seeking the relief and there must be a real possibility that the order, if made, will be enforceable by the process in personam. However, the courts expect and assume that their orders will be obeyed and will not normally refuse an injunction because of the respondent&#8217;s likely disobedience to the order.&#8221;</p>

On the one hand the starting point is that the courts expect and assume that their orders will be obeyed and will not normally refuse an injunction because of the respondent&#8217;s likely disobedience to the order. Romer LJ put the point forcefully in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Liddell</span> (page 374):</p>

It is not the habit of this Court in considering whether or not it will make an order to contemplate the possibility that it will not be obeyed.&#8221;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
			<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/>In <span style="font-style:italic">Re Liddle </span>itself there was a writ of sequestration, so the court could perhaps be more sanguine than otherwise that its order would be obeyed by the mother. As Slesser LJ said (page 373): &#8220;It has been said that this Court will not make an order which will be mere brutum fulmen. It seems that there has been a writ of sequestration. We are not to assume that the lady will necessarily disobey the Court or ignore the sanction imposed if she continues contumacious.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Drawing the threads together, the court is going to need evidence on two distinct matters. First, in relation to jurisdiction, the court will expect the applicant to put before the court evidence that service by email or letter or as the case may be is permitted by the law of the relevant foreign country: <span style="font-style:italic">Bacon v Automattic Inc and others </span>[2011] EWHC 1072 (QB), [2012] 1 WLR 753, para [53]. Second, in relation to discretion, the court will need evidence as to the applicable law and practice in the foreign court, evidence as to the nature of any proposed proceedings to be commenced in the foreign jurisdiction, and evidence as to whether the foreign court would be likely to enforce the injunction: compare <span style="font-style:italic">Dadourian Group International Inc v Simms and others (Practice Note)</span> [2006] EWCA Civ 399, [2006] 1 WLR 2499. Where the injunction, as here, engages freedom of speech, the evidence will also have to detail the foreign jurisdiction&#8217;s approach to such matters. Given the First Amendment, this is obviously particularly important in the case of the United States of America: cf the comments of His Honour Judge Parkes QC in <span style="font-style:italic">Davison v Habeeb and others </span>[2011] EWHC 3031 (QB), para [69].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The next point, and it is one of real importance, relates to what, in my judgment, is the thoroughly undesirable form of the order I was being invited to make. I have set out the key provisions above. A close reading of paragraph 3 reveals that the purpose of the proposed injunction is &#8220;preventing the identification (whether directly or indirectly) of the child&#8221; and that all it restrains is a &#8220;publication &#8230; likely whether directly or indirectly to lead to the identification of the child&#8221;. It does not, in other words, seek to prevent identification of the local authority, its social workers or others involved in the process. Mr MacDonald accepted that what he was seeking was indeed limited in that way. He was, if I may say so, wise to confine his claim. Nothing I have read in the evidence begins to suggest that this could be a case in which it would be appropriate to make an order of the kind referred to in para [24] above. I repeat what I said there. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">But if this is so, why does the draft contain paragraphs 3(a)(iv), (v) and (vi), the latter part of paragraph 3(b), and Schedules 3, 4 and 5? Their inclusion can serve only to confuse. In the first place, I simply fail to see how naming the local authority, the social workers, the local authority&#8217;s legal representative or the children&#8217;s guardian, or even all of them, can in any realistic way be said to make it &#8220;likely&#8221; that J will be identified, even indirectly. The risk is merely fanciful. But if this is so, then inclusion of reference to them is apt to mislead. The casual reader may think that the order prohibits the naming of any of them. The more careful reader will realise that this is not so, but may nonetheless assume that the court thought that naming them might lead to the identification of the child and may thus be deterred from doing so for fear of falling foul of the order. Either way, the effect is highly undesirable, tending as it does to confer indirectly the very anonymity which the court did not intend. All this verbiage must be removed, for otherwise it is likely to have a seriously chilling effect. When I put the point to Mr MacDonald he did not demur. A similar point can be made about paragraphs 3(a)(iii) and (vii) and 3(c). The wording of paragraph 3(c) in particular &#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">any other</span> particulars or information <span style="font-style:italic">relating to </span>the child&#8221; &#8211; is very wide, indeed unlimited. It would potentially embrace almost everything in paragraphs 3(a)(iii)-(vii) were they to be omitted, as well as much more besides. So if they are to go, so too should paragraph 3(c). Surely all that is needed at most are paragraphs 3(a)(i) and (ii) and the first part of paragraph 3(b).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a quite separate point, what is the justification for including paragraph 4, in particular paragraph 4(b)? It is very widely phrased, preventing anyone from seeking, for example from the father, &#8220;any information&#8221; relating not merely to J but also to the father himself. The father wishes to share such information with others and, so long as he keeps within the confines of section 12 of the 1960 Act, why should he not be able to do so? And why should those who may wish to hear his views not be permitted to approach him? On one view this is in effect, if not intention, a means of indirectly gagging the father so that what from the local authority&#8217;s perspective are his unpalatable views are less likely to see the light of day. It is one thing to say that something shall not be published if and insofar as it is prejudicial to J; this is very different and far more sweeping.</p>

The order sought is proportionate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As can be seen, Mr MacDonald&#8217;s submissions really fall into two parts. So long as the proceedings remain on foot, he submits that an order is required because the existing restraints have proved inadequate to control the placing of identifying material on the internet. In relation to the period after the proceedings have come to an end, he submits that this is a case where, despite what was said in <span style="font-style:italic">Clayton v Clayton</span>, continuing restraint is required, essentially because of the fact that identifying information, damaging to J, will remain, indefinitely and easily accessible, on the internet. </p>

So the application has to be considered on its own merits.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For reasons I have already explained, an injunction which cannot otherwise be justified is not to be granted because of the manner or style in which the material is being presented on the internet, nor to spare the blushes of those being attacked, however abusive and unjustified those attacks may be. The only justification, as Mr MacDonald correctly acknowledges, is if restraint is necessary in order to protect J&#8217;s Article 8 rights and, in particular, J&#8217;s privacy and anonymity.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is, however, in my judgment, a crucial difference in a case such as this, where we are concerned with a baby a day old (though the same point will no doubt apply to somewhat older children), between restraining publication of the child&#8217;s name and restraining publication of visual images of the child. There are three reasons for this. First, the reality is that although anyone can identify a baby by its name it is almost impossible, unless you are the parent, to distinguish between photographs of children of that age who have the same general appearance. Second, the reality, at least with current domestic technology where searches of the internet are by word (name) and not image, is that unless you have a name, or a mass of other identifying details, it is going to be very difficult, if not impossible, to locate anonymous postings about an individual. Third, in a case such as this, although there may be a powerful argument for asserting that the baby who features in a filmed episode should not be named, there are at least as powerful arguments for asserting that the publication on the internet of film such as I am concerned with here, commenting on the operation of the care system and conveying a no doubt powerful and disturbing message, should not be prevented merely because it includes images of the baby. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Assessing these three factors together, there is, it seems to me, a very powerful argument that the balance between the public interest in discussing the workings of the system and the personal privacy and welfare interests of the child is best and most proportionately struck by restraining the naming of the child while not restraining the publication of images of the child. The effect of this is that (a) the essential vice &#8211; the identification of the child &#8211; is in large measure prevented, (b) internet searches are most unlikely to provide any meaningful &#8216;link&#8217; in the searcher&#8217;s mind with the particular child, and (c) the public debate is enabled to continue with the public having access to the footage albeit not knowing who the anonymous child is whose image is on view.    </p>
