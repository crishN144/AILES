	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Today I&#160;have been faced with a somewhat unusual and indeed undesirable situation.  In briefest of summary, the essential factual background (and here I&#160;am not mentioning anything which is not already in the public domain) is that a child, now aged nearly two, was conceived as a result of a private arrangement between two men, who live together in a settled relationship, and a woman.  The woman is the genetic mother of the child.  She carried the child and bore the child, and indeed, as I&#160;understand it, the child lived with her for a period following her birth.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">There was then a dispute and contest between the men on the one hand and the mother on the other hand as to with whom the child should be brought up.  That dispute came to a head in a hearing that lasted a number of days earlier this year before Russell J.  She reserved her judgment and gave judgment on 30</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt"/><span style="font-size:14pt">April 2015.

There is a short passage in paragraphs 38 to 40 of her judgment under a heading &#8220;Social Media&#8221; in which she refers to that.  No doubt because of those concerns, she had already made, during the course of the early stages of the hearing, an order dated 23 January 2015 which, by paragraphs 10, 11 and 12, put some considerable restrictions upon the mother&#8217;s freedom to communicate information about the proceedings, and also put her under positive duties to use her best endeavours to prevent other persons from disseminating information about the case.</span></p>

I&#160;enquired today of Miss Moore whether any further or additional reasons had been given orally at the hearing as to the scope of the orders actually made.  Miss&#160;Moore does not recall any reason specifically being given.  She said, however, that in the interval between the judgment being circulated in draft to counsel and the hand down on 30 April 2015, Ms. Elizabeth Isaacs QC, who appeared then (but does not appear now) on behalf of the two fathers, had drafted a reporting restriction order in relatively conventional terms.  Miss&#160;Moore says that she recalls that this was handed in to the judge who considered that it was not sufficiently restrictively drawn and who redrafted parts of it herself, or indicated the manner in which it was to be redrafted.</span></p>

The later order of 30&#160;April 2015 does not expressly discharge paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 of the earlier order of 23&#160;January 2015, but it is, I&#160;think, tolerably obvious that the intention was that paragraphs 6 and 7 of the order of 30 April would supersede and replace paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 of the earlier order.</span></p>

That came on for hearing before Bodey J on 20 May 2015.  For reasons which are not clear to me, on that day Associated Newspapers Limited decided that they would withdraw their application for a variation of the terms of the reporting restriction order.   But at the same time the mother herself informed the court that she wished to make an application to vary the reporting restriction order and also the restrictions upon her in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the order under the Children Act dated 30 April 2015.</span></p>

Of course, it frequently happens that judges - for instance when sitting as the Applications Judge - may make injunctions, whether reporting restriction orders, or freezing orders, or a range of other injunctive orders, which are then further considered by a different judge at a return date relatively soon afterwards.  This, however, is not that sort of situation at all.  In this case, Russell J has devoted many days to hearing this case and clearly also considerable time and thought to preparing her judgment.  In other words, she, uniquely amongst judges, knows this case very well.  She has heard abundant evidence from all the parties involved.  If anyone is to reconsider the language and scope of her orders at first instance, then it should be her.  If and in so far as the mother, is seeking, in effect, to &#8220;appeal&#8221; provisions of the order that was made in her presence, then I&#160;have neither the right nor the power in any way whatsoever to sit &#8220;on appeal&#8221; from Russell J.  I&#160;wish to make crystal clear that by the steps that I&#160;have agreed to take today, I&#160;am not in any way whatsoever arrogating to myself some right or power which I&#160;do not have to sit on appeal from her.</span></p>

More strikingly, the child&#8217;s guardian has also attended today, and in advance of the hearing Miss&#160;Moore placed before the court a thoughtful position statement dated 22 October 2015.  The guardian, of course, is only underlyingly concerned with the best interests of the child for whom she acts as guardian.   But in essence and in summary, the position statement of Miss&#160;Moore on behalf of the guardian explains that, although the guardian is very concerned about anything which might reveal the identity of the child, she recognises that injunctions in the wide and very restrictive terms of the current injunctions are not easy to justify.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">At the outset of the hearing today, I&#160;made very clear on the one hand that I&#160;was not willing to adjudicate on any disputed matters which, in my view, can only be the subject of adjudication by Russell J, or ultimately the Court of Appeal.   But I&#160;did also make plain that if, in fact, there was some degree of consensus between the mother, the fathers, the represented press and the guardian as to some re-drawing of the scope of the injunctions, then I&#160;would be willing to make orders today by consent.  On that basis we broke off at about 11.30 this morning, and there was clearly a sustained period of discussion and negotiation outside the court room to which I&#160;am not privy.</span></p>

In summary only, the essence of the agreement is that there is no opposition to the mother being able to communicate with the press, or indeed other media, with regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, provided - and it is a big proviso - that nothing is published which is likely directly or indirectly to identify the child or the fathers or other identifying aspects of any of them.  </span></p>

The proposed new reporting restriction order will be less restrictive than the current order and will be in what I&#160;would call the &#8220;usual&#8221; terms of a reporting restriction order in a case such as this.</span></p>

I&#160;stress that I&#160;do so essentially as a rubber stamp (although of course it will have all the force of a court order) in reliance upon the agreement of all the parties present, including Associated Newspapers Limited.  I&#160;make the order as a convenience and as a service to everybody directly affected by this case so that they do not have to go to the expense and delay of arranging a further hearing before Russell J.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The other aspect is the scope and language of paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Children Act of 30&#160;April 2015.  At the moment, the terms of those paragraphs do, in fact, completely prohibit and prevent the mother from disseminating any information about this case to anybody, including specifically newspapers and other media.  Patently, therefore, effect could only be given to the agreed variation and relaxation of the reporting restriction order if there is also some relaxation of the language and effect of paragraphs 6 and 7 of that order.  </span></p>

Again, I&#160;stress that I&#160;do that essentially as a rubber stamp to that which has been agreed by all parties present, including the fathers.</span></p>

I&#160;am not prepared to give any consideration to that today, which, in my view, for the reasons I&#160;have already given, can only be properly considered by Russell J.  So if the mother seeks further variation or relaxation, then she must issue a fresh free-standing application and this time must expressly arrange with the Clerk of the Rules and the clerk to Russell J that it is Russell J, and no one else, who hears it.</span></p>
