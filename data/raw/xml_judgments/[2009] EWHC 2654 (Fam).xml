The length of this judgment flows from the way in which the factual disputes were prepared and presented and the general points that I have decided to make in that context (Part 2).  But also, as appears from Part 3, the case has raised points of principle that are not directly covered by existing authority.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in">This has been a hard fought claim for ancillary relief in which there was a number of disputes of fact advanced that raised credibility issues.  The procedure adopted in respect of such issues, and the general preparation of the case, followed the rules and a fairly standard path in proceedings of this type.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in">It follows that the comments and criticisms I make of the product of that path are criticisms of the path, and thus an approach to the preparation and presentation of &#8220;big money&#8221; cases that is generally adopted, rather than to the individuals involved in this case, who it seems to me have adopted an approach that accords with that adopted by many others who specialise in this field of litigation.  This is not surprising because the solicitors and counsel involved are experienced and respected practitioners in the field.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in">In my view, the product of this fairly standard path was that a number of the factual stepping stones or building blocks in the rival arguments were not constructively or adequately addressed.  So, in my view, this case provides an example of endemic failures of the approach generally adopted in respect of the trial of &#8220;big money&#8221; cases to properly identify issues, and the evidence required in respect of them.  I make some general closing remarks at the end of this judgment for consideration by the profession (Part 5).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in">The parties were married in June 1996 shortly after they had met for the first time.  For both of them it was their second marriage.  At the date of the marriage the husband was 44 and the wife almost 30.  The marriage finally broke down and the parties separated at the end of January 2006.  So they were together  as a married couple for 9 and a half years.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in">There are cross applications for ancillary relief.  In his affidavit of 11 October 2007 the husband asserted that both claims should be dismissed.  The wife pursues her claim (which was issued later) and seeks a substantial award.  She has therefore been treated as the Applicant and the husband has made her an open offer.  So his stance is no longer, and for some time has not been, that both claims should be dismissed.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in">The date fixed for the hearing, with a 10 day estimate, was 16 March 2009.  The respective open positions of the parties (then and now) are dated 3 March 2009 (wife) and 10 March 2009 (husband).  They are a long way apart.  The wife&#8217;s open position is that she seeks a lump sum which will result in a division of the total assets as to 60% to the husband and 40% to the wife on the basis of a clean break and that costs be dealt with by the court.  The lump sum (subject to refinement by reference to updating disclosure and add backs) was estimated at &#163;10 million.  The husband&#8217;s open position was that he would pay the wife &#163;2,896,448 representing one half of the net increase in the value of his company between the date of the marriage and the date of separation, less the amount paid to the wife on account of her lump sum, and that there be no order as to costs.  The offer was based on Mr A&#8217;s valuations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in">When the case came on for hearing in March 2009 (with its 10 day estimate) I gave the parties the opportunity to demonstrate to me that the case was ready for trial.  Having heard them I gave an ex tempore judgment to the effect that in my view the case was not then ready for trial on a central dispute of fact, namely that the wife had undisclosed substantial assets or ready access to such assets.<span style="font-style:italic"/>I therefore adjourned the trial on 17 March 2009.  It was, and remains, my view that there had been significant failures to take proper steps to prepare the case.  Fortunately a date in June 2009 was found for the trial.  I rejected what to my mind was an inappropriate approach by both counsel that the case should be re-fixed for their convenience. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in">I ordered further disclosure in respect of that central dispute.  It seemed (and still seems) to me that this disclosure was an obvious and vital element of any properly prepared and argued determination of that issue and I therefore fail to understand how the parties had not made provision for it prior to the first hearing.  The point that the District Judge had limited disclosure of such material to dates after the breakdown of the marriage does not prevent the parties recognising that the issues raised in this case merit wider disclosure and it being provided by agreement, or further order.  The terms of my order were agreed between the parties who took the opportunity to include provisions for disclosure in addition to the disclosure triggered by my decision. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I acknowledge that this could have been better drafted but, as explained in court, my purpose in making this direction was to provide a procedure through which the parties identified the findings that each of them was inviting me to take into account as factors in the s. 25 exercise and the subsidiary facts (stepping stones or building blocks) they were inviting me to find to establish those findings.  </p>

If that is wrong, and she is not domiciled in the UK, she would be liable to UK tax on remittances.  So it seems to me that the dispute as to the ownership of the relevant foreign assets had at least the potential for serious &#8220;knock on&#8221; effects outside this litigation for both the wife and her mother which warranted close attention being paid to its presentation by both sides.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in">Before the hearing in March 2009 there had been skirmishes in respect of the affidavit evidence that the husband sought to rely on from members of his family relating to this issue, and thus what they had been told and observed relating to it.  There had also been exchanges in questionnaire and correspondence.  But it was not until some time after the March 2009 adjournment that the husband&#8217;s legal team sought letters of request in respect of evidence from the wife&#8217;s mother, and officers of relevant companies in the Isle of Man (albeit that at a much earlier stage letters of request had been sought by them in respect of evidence relating to the husband&#8217;s company from persons in Scotland).</p>

My answers included points I have already made in respect of the level of expenditure.  In respect of the source of the funds it seemed to me that I would be asked to make findings as to the size of the wife&#8217;s father&#8217;s estate, its devolution and the funding of the payments shown to have been made by the wife&#8217;s parents to the wife by the disclosure by the wife of heavily redacted bank statements.</p>

In commenting on the draft of this judgment counsel for the husband argued that the approach taken in final written and oral submissions was an appropriate and conventional way of presenting a case when a client holds a deeply committed view which he is nonetheless unable to establish on evidential grounds and referred me to paragraphs 303 and 708 of the Code of Conduct.   Although I fully accept that counsel were acting in a manner they considered to be correct and conventional: I do not agree with that view and I have not come across this convention.  Rather, in my view, if a client who is funding the litigation will not give instructions to concede a point because he does not accept advice that his assertion cannot be established to the civil standard on the evidence as a whole then, unless for some professional reason counsel is unable to do so (e.g. he is aware that some evidence is false or of a refusal to put relevant material before the court), it is his duty to advance the assertion to the best of his ability on the evidence before the court, albeit that he is of the view that he has little or no chance of persuading the judge to make the finding sought by his client.

This evidence was at the centre of the presentation of this poorly defined aspect of the husband&#8217;s case in the written evidence and during the oral evidence.  So far as I am aware there was no professional reason why that evidence could not still have been relied on in submissions on the basis that its assessment was a matter for the court rather than counsel.   The final position of the husband through counsel means that to a large extent the relevance of those two disputes falls away.  However, as they both remain issues that were explored at some length and which go to credit, I comment on them elsewhere.</p>

They are allegations of, or equivalent to, an allegation of fraudulent conspiracy that if they were relied on as a cause of action in other civil litigation would have to be pleaded with particularity.   Here the assertions do not constitute a cause of action and they are inherent in (albeit not expressly set out in) the underlying dispute and the exchange of written evidence.  But nonetheless in my view such serious allegations should, as a matter of fairness and good practice, be spelt out clearly so that the parties, and the witnesses, know the case they have to meet and disclosure issues can be considered in that light.</p>

In reaching this view I have not forgotten that she naturally had a number of discussions with him about the business and some problems that arose, particularly in connection with employment issues, and helped in drafting some documents.

This was a proper and inevitable acceptance that her assertion in her Form E, and the parts of her written evidence directed to it, that she was a &#8220;fully contributing wife&#8221; in this sense was flawed.

This is because on the hypothetical basis of his valuation (i.e. willing seller and willing buyer) it is highly likely, if not inevitable, that such forecasts would have been produced.

The purpose of this was to seek to establish the finding sought by the wife that both accountants were wrong in their valuation as at 31 January 2006 (albeit that the wife&#8217;s primary position was that it was unnecessary to decide what that value was).  To the non-accountant this point may have potential.  But, as it related to the methodology used by both accountants (and thus to something that was well within their expertise as the expert witnesses instructed by the parties), in my view, as a matter of good practice relating to expert evidence and common sense, it should have been raised with the accountants, together with any published material from an appropriate source which was to be used to support it, before the hearing.  This was not done.  When the point was put to Mr A, unsurprisingly he did not agree with it.  Counsel did not put to him that Mr G would be agreeing with it, or what Mr G would be saying about it.  This is a clear indication that the questioning was pursued either on the basis that it was not known what Mr G would say, or in the knowledge that he did not agree with the point being made.

As he commented, the position is that although, of course, accountants do the best they can to put an accurate value on a company applying the hypothesis of a willing seller and buyer (and like to cross check against actual offers and sales) the hypothetical nature of the exercise they are carrying out, and its methodology (which leads to wide differences in result if components of the figures and multiples used are varied within a permissible range), mean that there is uncertainty in the valuation given and often a wide range of reasonable figures. </p>

In the year to 31 January 2007 the company increased its customer base by about 30 companies which was a reflection of the growth in the oil and gas service sector of the market and the company&#8217;s investment that enabled it to take advantage of that growth.</p>

In the events that happened it produced significant financial reward for Mr Y through the sale of the shares.  But his appointment was to add strength to the management and his participation both before and after the sale was a plus factor in achieving the sale. </p>

I do not remember this evidence but accept that it was given in re-examination after he had received advice (with the consent of the wife) on legal professional privilege.  Earlier he had made reference to advice being sought from counsel about disclosure of the April offer.  It is not easy to see why this was necessary but does indicate that he was unwilling for the information to be disclosed.  </p>

Whether or not this was based on a view of Scottish law does not matter.  </p>

Although the wife described herself as an independent woman, it is clear that the wife has never based that independence on her own work and earnings.  Rather after she left university and before her first marriage she did not work.  During and after that marriage, and during her second marriage, she did not work.  Before her first marriage she received generous support from her father and mother through a settlement and otherwise, for example she was given a BMW and later a Mercedes car.  When her first husband was having financial difficulty in paying the mortgage on their matrimonial home there was no suggestion that they should move to the flat the wife had lived in before the marriage, or that the wife should work, or that they should in effect fend for themselves with some modest assistance from the wife&#8217;s parents.  Rather, the solution suggested and put into effect was that the wife&#8217;s parents should provide the funds for a substantial home in Buckinghamshire and its refurbishment.</p>

Further the evidence shows that the wife and her parents did not have any expectation or plan that the wife would support, or partly support, herself by working.  None of this is recorded or set out by way of criticism and when her first marriage broke down I recognise that she had a very young child and shortly after it she and her mother suffered the loss of the wife&#8217;s father.  </p>

In that analysis (a) the sum of &#163;148,500 is included as &#8220;inheritance&#8221;, and (b) a sum of &#163;30,000 from her mother in 1998 and a sum of &#163;29,000 for ad hoc gifts are included (which is broadly in line with an analysis of credits into the wife&#8217;s disclosed bank accounts prepared by the husband over a different period, albeit that an accurate comparison is not practical).  For the purpose of identifying annual spend over and above what was provided by the husband characterisation of receipts as inheritance or gifts is irrelevant and so the maths of these calculations is not affected by my conclusion that the &#163;148,500 was not paid in respect of the wife&#8217;s inheritance.  </p>

This equates to that shown on the analysis of the bank accounts for the sample years (although 1998 is lower).  This result also equates to the figure asserted by the wife to be her expenditure from her own money before these calculations were produced to the other side and the court.  (Whether or not the wife had done either of them earlier and, if so, the records she had used was not pursued).  In final submission, although inheritance and gifts are included in the above analysis, it was said that her expenditure was funded by the husband, from her own money which she had consistently put at &#163;40,000 per annum <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and</span> by money from her parents by way of inheritance and periodic gift (and therefore from 3 sources).</p>

An example of this is bills rendered by the wife&#8217;s present solicitors in respect of her first divorce and, as I understand it, in respect of disputes concerning the wife&#8217;s daughter.  Some of these bills may have been paid before the marriage but, for example, by the letters of 6 December 1996 and 9 January 1998 Mishcon de Reya sent bills to the wife&#8217;s mother for payment and, on 9 January 1998, there is an internal memo to the effect that all bills relating to the wife are to be sent to her mother for payment. These bills related to costs incurred in respect of advice and litigation concerning her first divorce and her daughter.  It is accepted that these bills were paid by the wife&#8217;s mother and it was not asserted that the payments were treated as loans or part payments of the wife&#8217;s legacy. </p>

In November 2008, the husband&#8217;s solicitors asked the wife to sign an authority in relation to the obtaining of copies of the statements for that credit card.  They replied that she had complied already with her disclosure obligations.

But there was no evidence as to his view of the wife&#8217;s first husband at that time.  By the time of his death that marriage was in major difficulty, the wife&#8217;s daughter was very young and she suspected that her husband was having an affair.  The wife&#8217;s mother said, and I accept, that her first husband&#8217;s greatest pleasure in his final years was seeing the beautiful and confident young woman that his daughter had become; but that this pleasure &#8220;was marred in the final months of his life by [her first husband&#8217;s] behaviour&#8221;.  The wife&#8217;s mother said, no doubt correctly, that her husband would have referred to him as &#8220;a cad&#8221; and was very distressed by his behaviour.</p>

This approach and understanding could be an explanation for the conversation related by the wife&#8217;s mother with her first husband shortly before his death to the effect that she would be alright and there would be enough for her.  This is because the money would be used for her and their daughter.  Although I acknowledge that these points could also fit with, or support, other conclusions relating to the creation of a trust or other formal arrangement outside the will for the benefit of the wife, in my view the provision in the will coupled with an understanding of a continuance of generous support (which her parents could well afford) fits readily and easily with what has been proved and admitted to  have happened. </p>

Albeit that the wife&#8217;s father did purchase an annuity (its amount was not contained in the evidence) I reject the balance of this evidence of the husband.  Even in temper or distress I do not accept that the wife would have said this and her father&#8217;s will and the information we have (albeit limited) as to the size of his estate indicate that this was not true.  Further, for reasons I have explained, it seems to me more likely than not that the wife&#8217;s parents had an understanding and joint desire to help their daughter financially.  As they have done so generously, this supports the view that I have reached that the wife&#8217;s father did trust his wife to continue this support.

For example, when she was describing the terms of the will of her second husband she left me with an impression that the provision of his will she described as a love letter was unfair and she should have received more, albeit that she had to accept that this passage in his will was accurate as to their respective wealth.  So, it seems to me, that in asserting that the husband had provided generously for their daughter she could well have given the same impression because of the moral obligation this imposed on her to make this provision for him to the daughter he doted on, even though by doing so there would be still be very substantial sums available for her own use.  I add that to my mind both impressions do not reflect the considered  underlying views of the wife&#8217;s mother on the fairness of the approached adopted by her husbands.</p>

There is no indication that the wife has suffered a drop in her standard of living and so this shortfall, and the point that the wife made no application for interim maintenance until one year after the husband ceased to maintain her, are supportive of the views I have reached (without taking this into account) as to the level of support that her mother has been giving to her.</p>

Any or all of them might supply such a reason, although one must be careful to avoid double counting.  The cardinal feature is that each is looking at factors which are linked to the parties&#8217; relationship, either causally or temporally, and not to extrinsic, unrelated factors, such as a disability arising after the marriage has ended.</p>

In the great majority of cases, the court is trying to ensure that each party and their children have enough to supply their needs, set at a level as close as possible to the standard of living which they enjoyed during the marriage (note that the House did not adopt a restrictive view of needs in the <span style="font-style:italic">White</span> case <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 AC 596" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 AC 596</ref> ant 608G &#8211; 609A).  This is a perfectly sound rationale where the needs are the consequence of the party's relationship, as they usually are. ---------- <span style="font-style:italic">A further source of need may be the way in which the parties chose to run their life together.</span> ----------  <span style="font-style:italic">All couples throughout their lives together have to make choices about who will do what,</span> sometimes forced upon them by circumstances such as redundancy or low pay, sometimes freely made in the interests of them both.  <span style="font-style:italic">The needs generated by such choices are a perfectly sound rationale for adjusting the parties&#8217; respective resources in compensation</span>.</p>

Need had become "reasonable requirements&#8221; and thus more generous to the recipient, but it was still a limiting factor even where there was a substantial surplus of resources over needs ------------ .

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;There is much to be said for returning to the language of the statute.  Confusion might be avoided if courts were to stop using the expression "reasonable requirements" in these cases, burdened as it is now with the difficulties mentioned above.  This would not deprive the court of the necessary degree of flexibility.  Financial needs are relative.  Standards of living vary.  In assessing financial needs, a court will have regard to a person's age, health and accustomed standard of living.  The court may also have regard to the available pool of resources.  Clearly, and this is well recognised, there is some overlap between the factors listed in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25 (2)</ref>.

In <span style="font-style:italic">Miller </span> the House clearly moved towards the position of Lord Cooke.  Thus Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, at paras [20] and [29], referred to the "equal sharing principle" and to the "sharing entitlement"; those phrases describe more than a yardstick for use as a check.

It concerns property acquired during the marriage by one spouse by gift or succession or as a beneficiary under a trust.  For convenience I will refer to such property as inherited property. Typically, in countries where a detailed statutory code is in place, the legislation distinguishes between two classes of property: inherited property, and property owned before the marriage, on the one hand, and "matrimonial property" on the other hand.  A distinction along these lines exists, for example, in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/37" uk:canonical="1985 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985</ref> and the (New Zealand) Matrimonial Property Act 1976. </span></p>

According to this view, on a breakdown of the marriage these two classes of property should not necessarily be treated in the same way.  Property acquired before marriage and inherited property acquired during marriage come from a source wholly external to the marriage.  In fairness, where this property still exists, the spouse to whom it was given should be allowed to keep it.  Conversely, the other spouse has a weaker claim to such property than he or she may have regarding matrimonial property. </span></p>

It represents a contribution made to the welfare of the family by one of the parties to the marriage.  The judge should take it into account.  He should decide how important it is in the particular case. The nature and value of the property, and the time when and circumstances in which the property was acquired, are among the relevant matters to be considered.  However, in the ordinary course, this factor can be expected to carry little weight, if any, in a case where the claimant's financial needs cannot be met without recourse to this property.&#8221;</span></p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">White</span>, it was also recognised that the importance of the source of the assets will diminish over time (see p 611b). As the family's personal and financial inter-dependence grows, it becomes harder and harder to disentangle what came from where.

Is the 'matrimonial property' to consist of everything acquired during the marriage (which should probably include periods of pre-marital cohabitation and engagement) or might a distinction be drawn between 'family' and other assets?

But also included are other assets which were obviously acquired for the use and benefit of the whole family, such as holiday homes, caravans, furniture, insurance policies and other family savings. To this list should clearly be added family businesses or joint ventures in which they both work. It is easy to see such assets as the fruits of the marital partnership. It is also easy to see each party's efforts as making a real contribution to the acquisition of such assets. Hence it is not at all surprising that Mr and Mrs McFarlane agreed upon the division of their capital assets, which were mostly of this nature, without prejudice to how Mrs McFarlane's future income provision would be quantified. </p>

The other party has often made some contribution to the business, at least in its early days, and has continued with her agreed contribution to the welfare of the family (as did Mrs Cowan). But in these non-business-partnership, non-family asset cases, the bulk of the property has been generated by one party. Does this provide a reason for departing from the yardstick of equality? On the one hand is the view, already expressed, that commercial and domestic contributions are intrinsically incommensurable. It is easy to count the money or property which one has acquired. It is impossible to count the value which the other has added to their lives together. One is counted in money or money's worth. The other is counted in domestic comfort and happiness. If the law is to avoid discrimination between the gender roles, it should regard all the assets generated in either way during the marriage as family assets to be divided equally between them unless some other good reason is shown to do otherwise. </p>

Even modest legislative steps towards this have been strenuously resisted. Ownership and contributions still feature in divorcing couples' own perceptions of a fair result, some drawing a distinction between the home and joint savings accounts, on the one hand, and pensions, individual savings and debts, on the other (<span style="font-style:italic">Settling Up</span>, para 128 earlier, chapter 5). Some of these are not family assets in the way that the home, its contents and the family savings are family assets. Their value may well be speculative or their possession risky. It is not suggested that the domestic partner should share in the risks or potential liabilities, a problem which bedevils many community of property regimes and can give domestic contributions a negative value. It simply cannot be demonstrated that the domestic contribution, important though it has been to the welfare and happiness of the family as a whole, has contributed to their acquisition. If the money maker had not had a wife to look after him, no doubt he would have found others to do it for him. Further, great wealth can be generated in a very short time, as the <span style="font-style:italic">Miller </span>case shows; but domestic contributions by their very nature take time to mature into contributions to the welfare of the family. </p>

There may be no relationship-generated needs or other disadvantages for which compensation is warranted. We can assume that the family assets, in the sense discussed earlier, should be divided equally. But it might well be fair to leave undisturbed whatever additional surplus each has accumulated during his or her working life. However, one should be careful not to take this approach too far. What seems fair and sensible at the outset of a relationship may seem much less fair and sensible when it ends. And there could well be a sense of injustice if a dual career spouse who had worked outside as well as inside the home throughout the marriage ended up less well off than one who had only or mainly worked inside the home. &#8221;</p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Baroness Hale acknowledges that the difference between the two approaches will in the great majority of cases be irrelevant. Further, it seems to me that after a short marriage it may in reality often be difficult to determine precisely what assets (other than family assets) were generated during the marriage. The present case is an example, with arguments about whether Mr Miller can be said (by reason of his contacts, his gentleman's agreement with Mr Duffield and/or his experience) to have brought into the marriage any asset relating to his potential interest in New Star. To take into account the shortness of a marriage could enable a court to cut through some of these more intricate arguments in a manner consistent with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25(2)</ref>(d) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>. More fundamentally, to allow the duration of a marriage as a relevant factor would cater for the considerations that, while some people may make a large amount of money in a short time, the nature of their work or other factors may mean that they do not do so at a consistent rate over their lives as a whole or for more than a short period of their lives, and furthermore, as Baroness Hale has pointed out, that there may be long-term risks in relation to non-business-partnership, non-family assets which remain with those directly involved in generating them. The longer the marriage, the less likely these are to be significant considerations. In a short marriage, the timing of which may or may not coincide with a period of significant increase in the value of non-business-partnership, non-family assets, such considerations argue in favour of some further flexibility in the application of the yardstick of equality of division. I see force in and would agree with the views expressed by Baroness Hale in paragraphs 152-153 of her judgment to the effect that the duration of a marriage, mentioned expressly in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/37/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25(2)</ref>(d) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/37" uk:canonical="1985 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, cannot be discounted as a relevant factor. </p>

The present marriage had what one might call a traditional aspect. Mr Miller worked, and Mrs Miller gave up work to look after him. But there can be marriages, long as well as short, where both partners are and remain financially active, and independently so. They may contribute to a house and joint expenses, but it does not necessarily follow that they are or regard themselves in other respects as engaged in a joint financial enterprise for all purposes. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Intrusive enquiries into the other's financial affairs might, during the marriage, be viewed as inconsistent with a proper respect for the other's personal autonomy and development, and even more so if the other were to claim a share of any profit made from them.</span> In such a case the wife might still have the particular additional burden of combining the bearing of and caring for children with work outside the home. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">If one partner (and it might, with increasing likelihood I hope, be the wife) were more successful financially than the other, and questions of needs and compensation had been addressed, one might ask why a court should impose at the end of their marriage a sharing of all assets acquired during matrimony which the parties had never envisaged during matrimony. Once needs and compensation had been addressed, the misfortune of divorce would not of itself, as it seems to me, be justification for the court to disturb principles by which the parties had chosen to live their lives while married.</span>.&#8221;</p>

Like the introduction of property into a marriage at its inception (being property helpfully described by Burton J. in <span style="font-style:italic">FS v. JS</span><span/><a class="Hyperlink" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2006/2793.html" style="text-decoration-line:none">[2006] EWHC 2793</a>, at [28], as "pre-matrimonial") or the introduction into it of property received during it by inheritance or gift (being property there described by Burton J. as "extra-matrimonial"), the generation of wealth during a marriage has conventionally been taken as one obvious form of contribution to the welfare of the family. Here, however, Baroness Hale articulated a refinement, namely that the generation of wealth should not always qualify as a contribution to the welfare of the family and in particular perhaps that in excess of a certain level its generation should not so qualify. The dividing-line is no doubt elusive. But, if the present case were to be one in which, in excess of a certain level, the husband's wealth were not to qualify as the product of a contribution to the welfare of the family, how should the court treat the excess? Mr Singleton submits, albeit with diffidence, that the excess would not be susceptible of redistribution and so should all lie in the hands into which it has fallen, namely those of the husband. We reject that submission: a party's property would not fall outside the court's redistributive powers in s.<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/37/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.23</ref>-25 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/37" uk:canonical="1985 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> just because it was not the product of a contribution within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25(2)</ref>(f). With equal diffidence Mr Pointer submits, by contrast, that, because it is only a special contribution to the welfare of the family which justifies unequal division, the excess, not being the product of a special contribution, should fall for equal division. Such a result would in our view be almost absurd. The facts are that, before the judge, the case was accepted on both sides to be one in which, apart from &#163;1 million which is the subject of the third subsidiary ground of appeal, all the property, notwithstanding its size, was the product of the husband's special contribution to the welfare of the family within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25(2)</ref>(f); and that Mr Singleton, followed reactively by Mr Pointer, now uses this difficult passage in the speech of Baroness Hale as a bandwagon on to which to jump. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">In our view the size of the property in the present case should not compel departure from the usual conclusion that wealth generated by a party during a marriage is the product of a contribution on his or her part to the welfare of the family.</span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Next Mr Singleton submits that, in her speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller</span>, Baroness Hale identified a category of cases in which property should in no way be subject to the sharing principle, notwithstanding that the principle allows in rare cases for special contributions, and that the present case falls into the category. Baroness Hale described such cases, at [150], as "non-business-partnership non-family asset cases". In <span style="font-style:italic">FS v. JS</span> Burton J., at [29], usefully abbreviated the description to cases of "unilateral assets". In summary Baroness Hale suggested, at [149] to [152], that within the definition of matrimonial property a distinction fell to be made between "family assets" and the fruits of a business in which both parties had substantially worked, on the one hand, and the fruits of a business in which only one party had substantially worked, i.e. unilateral assets, on the other. The suggestion was that it was property only of the former character which was subject to the sharing principle. </p>

As we will show, Baroness Hale put forward the distinction between unilateral assets and other matrimonial property for use in cases in which the marriage was short. And, although obiter she suggested an extension of it to another situation, namely that of the dual career to which we turn in paragraph 86 below, she definitely did not commend the distinction for use in other cases.  Its application in a case such as the present would be deeply discriminatory </span>and would gravely undermine the sharing principle articulated, albeit embryonically, in <span style="font-style:italic">White</span> and emphatically developed in other parts of the speeches in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller</span> itself. </p>

The husband had assets of about &#163;32 million, of which &#163;17 million was pre-matrimonial property. Ostensibly the balance of &#163;15 million was matrimonial property; but its characterisation was complicated by the fact that it represented the value of shares in a venture which the husband joined six months after the marriage pursuant to plans made with a colleague prior to the marriage. By dismissal of the husband's appeal against dismissal of his appeal to this court, the decision of the House was to uphold the judge's award to the wife of &#163;5 million, i.e. one third of the ostensible matrimonial property. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Such was the context in which the House turned to consider whether the sharing principle applied to cases in which the property had been generated during a short marriage. It was in this area that the members of the House were in substantial disagreement; and we cannot subscribe to the ingenious attempt of Burton J. in <span style="font-style:italic">FS v. JS</span>, at [30] and [31], to reconcile their differences. We suggest with respect that, while the approach of Lord Nicholls was perhaps the more logical, the approach both of Baroness Hale, with which Lord Hoffmann agreed, and of Lord Mance was perhaps the more pragmatic. Lord Nicholls, at [17] to [20], stressed that the sharing principle was as fully applicable to short as to long marriages and that the concept of treating unilateral assets differently from other matrimonial assets discriminated in favour of the bread-winner. He justified departure from equal sharing of the matrimonial property in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller </span>by reference, at [73], to the amount of work done by the husband prior to the marriage referable to the venture. In a section entitled <span style="font-style:italic">"The source of the assets and the length of the marriage"</span> Baroness Hale, at [147] to [152], squarely faced the conceptual difficulties inherent in the different application of the sharing principle to short marriages but considered that, on balance, perceptions of fairness justified it. Such became, at [158], her rationale for justifying departure from equality in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller</span>. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Lord Mance, at [169], powerfully stressed the practical value of Baroness Hale's approach, namely that it would often obviate the need to address the argument, sometimes called the "seed-corn" argument, raised in Miller itself, to the effect that wealth which one of the parties ostensibly generated during the marriage was a crop of which he or she had sown the seed prior to it. </span></p>

Because of the convincing logical objections of Lord Nicholls to the different treatment of unilateral assets, we would prefer, so far as it is proper for us to do so, to keep the room for application of the concept closely confined.

The assessment of assets must be at the date of trial or appeal.  The language of the statute requires that.  Exceptions to that rule are rare and probably confined to cases where one party has deliberately or recklessly wasted assets in anticipation of trial.  In this case the reality is that the husband traded his wife&#8217;s unascertained share as well as his own between separation and trial, particularly committing those undivided shares to the investment in Baco.  The wife&#8217;s share went on risk and she is plainly entitled to what in the event has proved to be a substantial profit.

Some elements of the old concept of fault have been retained but essentially only as evidence of irretrievable break down. As already noted, parties are now free to end their marriage and then re-marry. </p>

This approach was followed by both courts below in the present case. Both the judge and the Court of Appeal had regard to the husband's conduct when, as the judge found, that conduct did not meet the statutory criterion. The husband's conduct did not rank as conduct it would be inequitable to disregard. </p>

It is not for the courts to re-draw the line elsewhere under the guise of having regard to all the circumstances of the case. It is not as though the statutory boundary line gives rise to injustice. In most cases fairness does not require consideration of the parties' conduct. This is because in most cases misconduct is not relevant to the bases on which financial ancillary relief is ordered today. Where, exceptionally, the position is otherwise, so that it would be inequitable to disregard one party's conduct, the statute permits that conduct to be taken into account.&#8221;</p>

			<p style="margin-left:1in">&#8220; ---------- Where there is no conduct which it would be inequitable to disregard, the court should not seek to weigh the parties' respective conduct or attitudes in an attempt to assess responsibility for the breakdown of a marriage, or to attribute "legitimacy" or "reasonableness" to the wish of one party to continue the marriage against the wishes of the other. One problem about any such attempt is evident from the first sentence of paragraph 37 of the judge's judgment quoted in paragraph 162 above. If "this marriage may well have been doomed", what significance can there be in the fact that one party recognised this earlier than the other? How is one to judge between harsh realism and wishful thinking?

But it would be difficult to do this in the context of a dual career family and so the comments of Baroness Hale and Lord Mance relating to such a marriage, and thus the choices made in it, provide a strong pointer in favour of the conclusion that the choices made by the parties and their consequences on, for example, income, the accrual of savings and capital, income earning capacities, needs, compensation and after needs and compensation have been considered the sharing of assets on divorce are relevant and admissible factors, when the court is carrying out the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 25</ref> exercise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in">Turning to an established good reason for departing from equality in an application of the sharing principle (i.e. pre-acquired assets), I ask rhetorically whether it would be fair to parties who marry in say their fifties, and after previous marriages where assets have been created for them and their children, to leave out of account their agreement to ring fence part of those assets and to pool others.  To my mind it would not be, both in assessing their relationship generated needs and a departure from equality in applying the sharing principle (see again paragraphs 27 to 29 of the judgment of  Thorpe LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Radmacher</span>).  Similar examples and answers could be posed and given in respect of gifted assets and post separation enhancement in value of assets.</p>

Whereas the way in which, or the principles by which, the parties have run their lives would generally relate to the period when the relationship was not breaking down and to conduct based on choices that were agreed, accepted, or at least at the time not criticised.  </p>

This conclusion is supported by the points made by Mance LJ in paragraph 133 of <span style="font-style:italic">Cowan </span>when he says that the bulk of the assets was between separation and the hearing the husband&#8217;s and under his control and he could do with it as he wished.

This is not so. Fairness has a broad horizon. Sometimes, in the case of a business, it can be artificial to attempt to draw a sharp dividing line as at the parties' wedding day. Similarly the 'equal sharing' principle might suggest that each of the party's assets should be separately and exactly valued. But valuations are often a matter of opinion on which experts differ. A thorough investigation into these differences can be extremely expensive and of doubtful utility. The costs involved can quickly become disproportionate.

In the light of this evidence, it seemed plain to me that the current value of the business reflects the husband&#8217;s work in it for the past 33 years and, as a result, it would be artificial to seek to define the business as solely matrimonial property.<br/><br/>[115] <marker name="tab"/>Mr Bishop submits that both parties brought some assets into the marriage but they counter balance each other.  In respect of the business, Mr Bishop seeks to discount the effect of the pre-marital history based on the fact that the husband was operating as a licensee and, accordingly, did not have an asset with any significant realisable value. Whilst this might be technically correct, it is a highly artificial argument and, even in its own terms, glosses over the fact that the buy-out in fact occurred after the effective end of the marriage. It is artificial because it is clear that the present value of the business is very significantly based on the fact that it has been operating successfully at the same site for over 30&#160;years.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;[116] &#8230; the current value reflects 33 years of endeavour.  I do not consider it appropriate, or indeed possible to seek to divide this current value into marital and non-marital property.  In this case such an exercise would be a wholly artificial exercise &#8230;&#8221;</p>

So, in my judgment, if for example a child of an extremely rich father has always had a very high standard of living before and during his or her marriage met by gifts from the father, and has not been given a stake in the wealth made or a beneficiary under trusts, the court can in applying the approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">TL </span>make an award by reference to the history that the father has generously provided funds in the past and will be likely to enable the child to pay the award.

Then they bought and refurbished the castle as their main home.

Based on (a) the material I have used to assess the support provided by the husband, (b) the wife&#8217;s budget and (c) the rival contentions relating to other expenditure I have arrived at a figure of between  &#163;40,000 to &#163;50,000,  giving &#163;150,000 per annum for the assessment of her need. Using Duxbury, and capitalisation calculations provided by the parties, as a guide in my view a fair capital sum to provide the wife with an income of &#163;150,000 a year for the rest of her life would be of the order of &#163;4.2m.  (In their helpful comments on the draft of this judgment counsel informed me that a conventional capitalisation for a female aged 43 at &#163;150,000 per annum is &#163;3,981,000.  But my higher figure is an estimate based on the material referred to, and could be said to have a small cushion over that amortised figure.

In my view it cannot be said that the product of those choices was not agreed or accepted by the parties as a lifestyle for their marriage or that that lifestyle is sufficiently unusual to warrant a different approach.

The starting point under FPR Rule 2.71 is therefore that each side will bear their own costs.  However in my judgment, at this stage in applying the sharing principle the costs of both parties should be allocated to a top slice of the assets now representing the moneys received by the husband for his shares and I should proceed on the basis that it is the balance of those assets that is available for sharing.  That top slice can then be dealt with separately before the order is drawn up, having regard to any argument raised on costs under FPR Rule 2.71 (e.g. 2.71(5)(f), which returns one to the overall quest for a fair result).  This approach enables the parties and the court to consider those arguments in the light of the conclusions reached by the court that impact on the matters listed in sub-rule (5).  It also enables the court to consider the impact of the starting point for costs on an award that does not (a) equate to an equal sharing of the available assets, and/or (b) mirror the split between the parties of the total of their costs bills.</p>

To my mind, all these steps are an essential and basic part of the efficient preparation and presentation of a case because they constitute the essential identification of the facts and matters relied on by each party and how they will set about proving them.  So, they are an integral part of the process of establishing the building blocks of the case to be presented by the parties to the court as to how it should exercise its broad statutory discretion.</p>

No doubt this process provides other advantages particularly at the early stages of proceedings and in smaller cases.  It is also the basic procedure that has to be followed.  But this does not mean that it cannot be supplemented where appropriate.</p>

It seems to me that often no such exercise is carried out, or committed to paper, before the preparation of skeleton arguments which is obviously much too late to inform the process of gathering evidence, and in any event often such skeletons do not set such matters out.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.58in">To my mind, by the time of an FDR each side should have identified the building blocks of their respective cases.  Indeed, the assessment of them and their product is at the heart of an FDR. So the process of considering them should have started well before the FDR, and reducing them to writing after it should not be a burdensome or particularly expensive task.   In my view, it will often be very helpful to set them out in an exchange of documents, and therefore I invite practitioners and judges after a failed FDR to consider carefully what should be done to clearly identify the building blocks of the cases advanced by the parties.  I also invite the parties to consider setting them out in writing in an open form before an FDR.</p>
