	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case involves the future care of two children, C and G both British citizens, who arrived at a London Airport in September 2015. They were then age 13 and 10. No adult was with them. Following initial enquiries the UK Border Agency (&#8216;UKBA&#8217;) made a referral to the London Borough of Hillingdon (&#8216;the LA&#8217;) who arranged for their placement with foster carers, where they remain</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Subsequent enquiries revealed the children had arrived from Pakistan, via Bahrain on a Gulf Air flight. This was part of a plan done with the consent and approval of their mother, DS (&#8216;the mother&#8217;), who remained in Pakistan. She does not seek the return of the children to her care. Prior to 2010 the mother, a British citizen who was born here, lived with the children&#8217;s father, PS (&#8216;the father&#8217;), in Holland, where the children were born in 2002 and 2005. The mother and father separated in 2010 and she and the children, with their two siblings, went to Pakistan. The children have not seen or had contact with their father since then. The father was ignorant of the children&#8217;s arrival in the UK in September. When contacted by the LA in May 2016 he stated he did not wish to care for them, although the paternal grandfather wished to have some contact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the reasons set out below, I consider this court has jurisdiction to determine this application under the provisions of Article 13 Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (&#8216;BllR&#8217;) as, in the unusual circumstances of this case, neither child&#8217;s habitual residence can be established. There is no issue that the threshold criteria under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> is met. The children have been abandoned here by their parents and, as a result, have suffered, and are likely to suffer, significant emotional harm and neglect. The order that best secures their future welfare needs is a care order, endorsing the plan for long term foster care with support being provided by the LA to enable them to maintain links with their birth family. This order accords with their wishes, and will provide them with the security and stability their welfare requires.</p>

She married the father, they lived in Holland and had four children, including C and G. Their siblings are E, 15 years, and X, 6 years, who, as far as is known, remain in Pakistan with their mother. The children were briefly known to social services in Holland in 2008, due to C&#8217;s challenging behaviour. Support was given and the case was closed.</p>

The father has very recently been located in Holland and was spoken to on 19 May. He confirmed he had not seen the children since 2010, he did not put himself forward to care for them, or wish to have any contact with them. He has remarried and has a young child. The paternal grandfather was also spoken to in May, he wished to remain in contact with C and G. The paternal family allege that the mother took out a loan prior to her departure from Holland in 2010, which left them with the burden of the debt. In addition, they say the mother went to Pakistan for a holiday with the children and simply didn&#8217;t return. </p>

She alleges he was physically abusive to C and G. She had two further children with him. In 2011 the British High Commission is Islamabad have a record of the mother contacting them once to report issues relating to domestic abuse. She did not follow that up with any further contact.</p>

Yet the Passport Agency have information that the maternal grandmother attended the passport office regarding the mother, and had contact with the agency again in October 2015.

The LA recorded this as consent to section 20 accommodation. She stated she wanted the children to be here and did not want them returned to her care. Apart from that initial contact via the UKBA it is not clear what further direct contact, if any, the LA had with the mother prior to issuing proceedings.</p>

Whilst there she sought to contact the mother and carry out an assessment. She discovered the address given by the mother did not exist, and the schools where the mother said the children attended had no record of them being there. The children have since said they were known at school under different names, as they would be discriminated against using their Hindu names. The social worker sought to contact the mother by telephone. Her call was answered by DD (&#8216;the uncle&#8217;), who is referred to as an uncle, although he is not a blood relation. He said the mother had moved out of the area, her husband was very controlling and violent which would make it difficult to contact her. The social worker did manage to speak to the mother, but she refused to meet, or give any information as to her whereabouts. She repeated her agreement to the children remaining in the UK.</p>

C received a text from his mother at the end of January stating that she had had to leave the city, as their step father was not happy about the amount of contact she was having with them. He reports she has been taken to a village four hours away and did not have a phone number for her. They have not reported having had contact with her since, although they have had contact with the uncle, spoken to his wife, and their sister E who was staying with them at the time. </p>

There was a concern the children may have been trafficked, that has since been discounted. The LA have concluded that the children were sent here for two reasons; first to access a better education and, second, to protect them from their step-father. The mother has said that she could not come with them, as her husband had retained her passport. The information from the Passport Agency indicates the mother&#8217;s British Passport expired in 2014 and has not been renewed. The Passport Agency have confirmed the children&#8217;s passports were renewed from abroad in July 2015.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The most up to date information about the mother is in a statement from her dated 11 May 2016 provided by the uncle. There are some concerning aspects about this statement; the mother&#8217;s English is limited, yet the statement is in English with no reference to a translation, and the uncle states he has not been able to contact the mother, yet he has been able to provide this written statement from her. In any event, the statement gives no significant new information, it confirms her agreement to the children remaining with foster carers and the reasons why she took the steps she did to send them abroad: for the children&#8217;s education, because she could not provide for them in Pakistan, and to protect them from her husband&#8217;s behaviour.</p>

At a visit in late January C was clear that he wished to remain here. He acknowledged he had friends in Pakistan, but did not have a positive relationship with either of his stepfathers and described being emotionally unsettled in Pakistan. G is described by the foster carer in late January as being very tearful and missing his mother and was described as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;being confused&#8217;</span> about his future, although thinks his &#8216;home&#8217; is in England.

He recognised that in the absence of the habitual residence of a child anywhere, BllR provides a fall-back jurisdiction based on their presence. He observed that in the context of adult disputes about them, the presence of children in a particular state on a particular day is an unsatisfactory foundation of jurisdiction because, by moving them from one state to another, one of the adults can so easily invoke a favourable jurisdiction or pre-empt invocation of an unfavourable one. However, as Lord Sumption observed in his dissenting judgment, it has to be recognised that adults can do that anyway.</p>

He continues <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;The concept operates in the expectation that, when a child gains a new habitual residence, he loses his old one. Simple analogies are best: consider a see-saw. As, probably quite quickly, he puts down those first roots which represent the requisite degree if integration in the environment of the new state, up will probably come the child&#8217;s roots in that of the old state to the point at which he achieves the requisite de-integration (or, better, disengagement) from it.&#8217;</span> In paragraph 48 he continued <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;The identification of a child&#8217;s habitual residence is overarchingly a question of fact. In making the following three suggestions about the point at which habitual residence might be lost and gained, I offer not sub-rules but expectations which the fact-finder may well find to be unfulfilled in the case before him: (a) the deeper the child&#8217;s integration in the old state, probably the less fast his achievement of the requisite degree of integration in the new state; (b) the greater the amount of adult pre-planning of the move, including pre-arrangements for the child&#8217;s day-to-day life in the new state, probably the faster his achievement of that requisite degree; and (c) were all the central members of the child&#8217;s life in the old state to have moved with him, probably the faster his achievement of it and, conversely, were any of them to have remained behind and thus to represent for him a continuing link with the old state, probably the less fast his achievement of it.&#8217;</span></p>

In my judgment at the time when this court was seised, on the exceptional facts of this case, these children had not acquired habitual residence here. Although by December 2015 they had been placed with foster carers for nearly three months and had been at school for two months, the LA were still making essential enquiries to establish the circumstances in which they had arrived here and what, if any, proposals were being made for them to return to Pakistan, or elsewhere. Their intention to come here needs to be considered in the context of the lack of any arrangements being made for them following their arrival. It was not until after December 2015 that the allocated social worker was able to speak to the mother about hers and the children&#8217;s circumstances, or establish any contact with the father. The children had no identified relatives here and their placement could have been terminated in the event the mother withdrew her consent. Apart from being British Citizens, these children had no other real connection with the UK; they had not been here before, and had no link with any relatives who may be here. Those who these children were dependent on prior to their departure from Pakistan could not be said to be integrated in a social or family environment in the UK. Whilst the circumstances in which they left Pakistan were such that they lost their habitual residence there by the time this court was seised, they had not put down sufficient roots here by December 2015 to acquire habitual residence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment they probably have acquired habitual residence here now. It is clear they have not only become more integrated in a social and family environment here, but additional information has come to light which establishes that there are no plans for them to return to Pakistan. There is in reality no home being offered for them there, or anywhere else. It has not been possible to make any direct contact with their mother since February 2016, other than via the uncle. The father has made it clear he is not in a position to care for them. Whilst their parent&#8217;s intention and circumstances are not determinative to the question of habitual residence, they are a factor. The fact that those who have cared for children in the immediate past remain in the other jurisdiction may point to habitual residence not having been given up, due to the degree of social and family connections there. Here it is the opposite, whilst all their immediate family remain in Pakistan this factor, in the circumstances of this case, doesn&#8217;t support habitual residence being retained in Pakistan.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I can take this aspect of the case relatively shortly, as there is no dispute between the LA and Guardian. The Guardian supports the threshold findings sought and the making of a care order with a plan for placement of both children to remain with their current carers as long term foster carers.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied the LA have established, on the balance of probabilities, that each child has suffered and is likely to suffer significant  emotional harm and neglect by being abandoned in the UK without having anyone available to care for them, with no accommodation, being without income and having no support arranged for their benefit. Their parents, who each have parental responsibility, have abdicated their responsibility to their children. The mother may have taken the steps she did for the best of intentions to protect the children from further harm from her husband and to enable them to have a better life but the actions she took, with no arrangements being in place following the children&#8217;s arrival here, caused both of them significant emotional harm and neglect. On any view it was a highly risky course to take. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In considering what order the court should make each child&#8217;s welfare is the courts paramount consideration. Each child&#8217;s wishes are to remain here placed with their current foster carer. There are no plans for the children to move from their current foster carers, which will be their long term placement. Whilst such a placement will mean they are separated from their mother and siblings, no one puts themselves forward to care for them in the event of their return to Pakistan. The LA care plan has arrangements in place to support continuing contact with their birth family. This is clearly essential as in due course they seek to understand the history of their placement here. They have settled well in their current placement and their attendance at school has been good. The reality is for these two young children there are limited alternatives for their care. Their welfare needs require stability and security to enable them to develop and mature in an emotionally supportive and secure environment, which a care order would achieve. The care plan for a long term foster placement under a care order made in favour of the LA will ensure the welfare needs of these two young children are secured. </p>
