In recent years the family has endured significant levels of stress and distress. N is seriously ill with an incurable disease which is usually terminal. D has experienced behavioural problems and has been diagnosed as suffering from attention deficit disorder and conduct disorder. J has been diagnosed as suffering from chronic motor or vocal tic disorder. By the time the proceedings commenced in January 2003 it was the local authority&#8217;s case that, although the stresses in the family will have contributed to the quality of the parents&#8217; care of the children, D and J had suffered significant emotional harm and all three children were likely to suffer significant physical and emotional harm by reason of the parents&#8217;, and in particular the mother&#8217;s, extreme and histrionic reaction to family events: for example, their inappropriate management of medication, their recurring failure to seek and follow up appropriate medical advice, their decisions to disengage from medical services and failure to engage with offers of behavioural therapies, and the mother&#8217;s inability to give accurate information regarding the children&#8217;s symptoms and medication &#8211; the local authority suggested that she was exaggerating or even fabricating the children&#8217;s symptoms.</p>

According to the local authority the mother refused to discuss the matter, demanded that the social workers leave and said &#8220;over my dead body&#8221; at the suggestion that the children be taken into local authority foster care. This crisis, as it was perceived by the local authority, precipitated the proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The proceedings were commenced by an application for emergency protection orders (&#8220;EPOs&#8221;) in relation to all four children issued the same day, 16 January 2003. EPOs in respect of the four children, to last until 24 January 2003, were made by the family proceedings court (&#8220;FPC&#8221;) at an ex parte hearing on 17 January 2003. N refused to be placed in care but D agreed and was placed, together with J and W, with emergency foster carers the same day, 17 January 2003. N remained at home being looked after by her parents. On 20 January 2003 the parents applied for the discharge of the EPOs. The same day the local authority applied for care orders in respect of D, J and W. At a hearing in the FPC on 21 January 2003 the parents agreed to withdraw their application to discharge the EPOs. Interim care orders for 28 days in respect of D, J and W were made by consent and the proceedings were transferred by the FPC to the care centre. On 23 January 2003 the proceedings were transferred by the Circuit Judge to the High Court. On 28 January 2003 a children&#8217;s guardian was appointed. On 31 January 2003 Bennett J gave directions including, importantly, a direction that the matter was to be listed for a contested interim care order hearing on 11 March 2003. On 28 February 2003 the three children were placed with their maternal grandparents; that, as I understand it, obviated the need for the contested interim care order hearing. On 16 April 2003, due to her worsening condition, N was admitted to the relevant NHS trust, where she remains permanently accommodated (having been detained since 6 May 2003 in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>). On 26 June 2003, and against the wishes of the local authority, D returned to the care of his parents. By then he was, of course, 15&#189; years old and there was probably little in practical terms that the local authority could do. Since then the proceedings in substance have continued only in respect of J and W.</p>

I conducted a further hearing (again by video link) on 20 October 2003. The final hearing took place on 3 November 2003. It had been fixed to last for 12 days; in the event it took less than a day. The case was not, of course, subject to the Protocol (see <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Direction (Care Cases: Judicial Continuity and Judicial Case Management) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 FLR 719" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 FLR 719</ref>), which came into force only on the day of the final hearing, but it was conducted in its latter stages very much in accordance with the spirit of the Protocol. A lengthy final hearing was avoided, very largely as a result of what turned out to be the productive meetings first of the experts and then of the advocates. Very significant amounts of time, and substantial amounts of public money, were saved by the use of video conferencing facilities.</p>

It was also clear that such a decision would accord with the wishes and feelings of the children. The experts recommended that a package of protective steps was necessary that would include an agreed key social worker for the family, identified medical personnel (GPs and specialists) to be involved in all treatment decisions, prescriptions, reviews and correspondence about the same, and a psychological assessment for J to consider ending his Prozac medication. The local authority was additionally recommending a protocol for the administration of all medication for each child and agreements relating to education and the sharing of information between education, health care and social care agencies. The detailed terms of a &#8216;contract&#8217; had been agreed between the parents and the local authority with the involvement of health service bodies and the relevant education resources.</p>

Accordingly, the issue of principle for determination at the hearing on 20 October 2003 was whether exceptionally, in the circumstance that everyone agreed that the children should return home, the management of the rehabilitation should be achieved by the continuation of the interim care orders which had been in place since January 2003.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority&#8217;s case before me on 20 October 2003 was compellingly deployed by Mr Ernest Ryder QC (as he then was) and Ms Alison Woodward, for whose assistance I am most grateful. In summary they sought to persuade me that it was right, and in each of the children&#8217;s best interests, to work in partnership with the family in circumstances where all were agreed that rehabilitation of the children home was the best option and where agreement had been reached as to a preventative or protective package that accorded with the advice of the experts. The local authority preferred this course to the pursuit of the threshold facts that it asserted (and which the experts, according to Mr Ryder, in part or in whole agreed) but which would reduce any prospect of partnership and rehabilitation to no more than a very remote possibility. It was emphasised that the local authority would not have considered such a course were it not for the experts&#8217; confirmation that their assessment of the nature and extent of the risk the children faced was not dependent upon any findings the court might make. Hence the determination of precise threshold facts was not, Mr Ryder said, a pre-requisite to the good care planning that all parties were able to agree.</p>

Although where the court is in a position to make care orders it is not an abdication but is acting in accordance with the intention of the legislation for it to do so, in the present case practical realities indicated that the court was not in a position to make care orders.</p>

In the admittedly unusual circumstances of this case, to have embarked upon a fact-finding hearing would not merely have been completely counter-productive; it would quite plainly have been detrimental to the children&#8217;s best interests. I readily acknowledge that in the vast majority of cases it is best that the truth should out, whatever it may turn out to be. And the court must be careful not to allow itself to be deterred from doing what is right by parental posturing. But the simple reality which confronted the local authority and the court on 20 October 2003, given what I am satisfied was the parents&#8217; utter determination to stick to their stated position, was that to have proceeded with a threshold finding would have made it impossible to proceed with the rehabilitation of the children to their parents that <span style="font-style:italic">everyone </span>agreed was in the circumstances so very much in the children&#8217;s best interests. Given that no-one was demanding a threshold hearing, and given that the children&#8217;s best interests demanded that there should not be a threshold hearing, I had no hesitation in endorsing the compromise put before me by Mr Ryder.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority now seeks to withdraw its application for care orders. The local authority&#8217;s view is that the children&#8217;s rehabilitation to their parents has been successful. The children present as happy and settled and no concerns have been raised since their return home, whether by the social worker, by the children&#8217;s schools or by medical professionals. The key social worker has visited and found the parents to be very welcoming and co-operative. The local authority is satisfied that the parents have acted appropriately since the children returned home, that they have co-operated with professionals, and that there is no further need for care orders. It submits that the continuation of the proceedings would accordingly serve no &#8220;solid purpose&#8221;. Indeed, the local authority&#8217;s view is that the making of any further orders would be not merely unnecessary but unduly intrusive. Moreover, it recognises that, given the parents&#8217; stance if the court were to find threshold proved, adverse findings as to the threshold criteria may have a detrimental effect on the welfare of the children. It makes clear, however, that it seeks to withdraw its application because it is satisfied that no order is required following the successful rehabilitation of the children. It maintains, however, that there were at the time the proceedings were issued reasonable grounds to believe that the threshold criteria were met. Nonetheless it seeks to persuade me that it is right, and in each of the children&#8217;s best interests, for me to give it leave to withdraw its applications for care orders.</p>

It is not to be assumed, when determining that question, that every child who is made the subject of care proceedings derives an automatic advantage from having them continued. There is no advantage to any child in being maintained as the subject of proceedings that have become redundant in purpose or ineffective in result. It is a matter of looking at each case to see whether there is some solid advantage to the child to be derived from continuing the proceedings.&#8221;</p>

It must give the parents a proper opportunity to answer (either orally and/or in writing as the parents wish) the allegations being made against them. And it must give the parents a proper opportunity (orally and/or in writing as they wish) to make representations as to why the local authority should not take the threatened steps. In short, the local authority must involve the parents properly in the decision-making process. In particular, the parents (together with their representatives if they wish to be assisted) should normally be given the opportunity to attend at, and address, any critical meeting at which crucial decisions are to be made.&#8221;</p>

But although the circumstances and some of the sequelae may be different the principles are surely the same. After all, the child of 5 or 10 who, as in the present case, is suddenly removed from the parents with whom he has lived all his life is exposed to something the new-born baby is mercifully spared: being suddenly wrenched away in frightening &#8211; perhaps terrifying &#8211; circumstances from everything he has known and loved and taken away by people and placed with other people who, however caring and compassionate they may be, are in all probability total strangers.</p>

There are, after all, other family law contexts in which the absence of any effective right of appeal has prompted the court to acknowledge that judicial review is or may be an appropriate remedy: see Cazalet J&#8217;s observations in <span style="font-style:italic">T v Child Support Agency </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 1 WLR 144" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 1 WLR 144</ref> and my own judgments in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Marsh) v Lincoln District Magistrates&#8217; Court </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2003/956" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 956 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 956 (Admin)</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re L, L v P and CSA </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2003/1682" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 1682 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 1682 (Fam)</ref>.

In this regard a fair balance has to be struck between the interests of the child remaining in care and those of the parent in being reunited with the child. In carrying out this balancing exercise, the Court will attach particular importance to the best interests of the child which, depending on their nature and seriousness, may override those of the parent. In particular, a parent cannot be entitled under Article 8 to have such measures taken as would harm the child's health and development.</p>

Nor may it even be desirable, even if possible, to do so if those having custody of the child are seen as the source of an immediate threat to the child, since giving them prior warning would be liable to deprive the measure of its effectiveness. The Court must however be satisfied that the national authorities were entitled to consider that there existed circumstances justifying the abrupt removal of the child from the care of its parents without any prior contact or consultation. In particular, it is for the respondent State to establish that a careful assessment of the impact of the proposed care measure on the parents and the child, as well as of the possible alternatives to the removal of the child from its family, was carried out prior to the implementation of a care measure. The fact that a child could be placed in a more beneficial environment for his or her upbringing will not on its own justify a compulsory measure of removal from the care of the biological parents; there must exist other circumstances pointing to the &#8220;necessity&#8221; for such an interference with the parents&#8217; right under Article 8 to enjoy a family life with their child.&#8221;</p>

It provides both the local authority and the FPC with a carefully calibrated hierarchy of means by which the State&#8217;s response to a child&#8217;s perceived needs can be met.

If the real purpose of the local authority&#8217;s application is to enable it to have the child assessed then consideration should be given to whether that objective cannot equally effectively, and more proportionately, be achieved by an application for, or by the making of, a CAO.

That is simply not acceptable. No EPO should be made for any longer than is absolutely necessary to protect the child. Where the EPO is made on an ex parte (without notice) application very careful consideration should be given to the need to ensure that the initial order is made for the shortest possible period commensurate with the preservation of the child&#8217;s immediate safety. If all this means that FPCs have to rearrange their sitting patterns, then so be it. The period for which a child is to be removed must be determined &#8211; indeed, consistently with the Convention it can lawfully only be determined &#8211; by reference to the needs of the child and having regard to the rights of the parents. Such fundamental matters are not to be regulated by the non-availability of courts or judges.</p>

	    <intro>
	      <p class="Heading2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Although an EPO confers on the local authority both parental responsibility (see section 44(4)(c)) and the right to remove the child at any time to accommodation provided by the local authority (section 44(4)(b)(i)), the local authority&#8217;s exercise of these powers is strictly limited. Section 44(5)(b) provides that the local authority may exercise its parental responsibility only in such manner &#8220;as is reasonably required to safeguard or promote the welfare of the child&#8221;. Section 44(5)(a) provides that the local authority shall exercise its power of removal under section 44(4)(b)(i) &#8220;only &#8230; in order to safeguard the welfare of the child.&#8221; These are real and important limitations. The local authority must, in particular, apply its mind very carefully to whether removal is essential in order to secure the child&#8217;s immediate safety. The mere fact that the local authority has obtained an EPO is not of itself enough. The FPC decides whether to make an EPO. But the local authority decides whether to remove. Section 44(5) requires a process within the local authority whereby there is a further consideration of the action to be taken <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> the EPO has been obtained. No procedure is specified, and I accept of course that it is sufficient if the social worker considers the point before removing the child. That said, it would obviously be prudent for local authorities to have in place procedures to ensure both that the required decision making actually takes place and that it is appropriately documented. For, as <span style="font-style:italic">P, C and S v United Kingdom </span>shows (see below), the Strasbourg court is concerned about the process of decision making <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>the EPO has been obtained. In particular, it is concerned to ensure that the local authority, even after it has obtained an EPO, considers less drastic alternatives to emergency removal. As the court said in <span style="font-style:italic">Haase v Germany </span>at para [101]:</p>

If the State, in the guise of a local authority, seeks to intervene so drastically in a family&#8217;s life &#8211; and at a time when, ex hypothesi, its case against the parents has not yet even been established &#8211; then the very least the State can do is to make generous arrangements for contact. And those arrangements must be driven by the needs of the family, not stunted by lack of resources. Typically, if this is what the parents want, one will be looking to contact most days of the week and for lengthy periods. And local authorities must be sensitive to the wishes of a mother who wants to breast-feed and must make suitable arrangements to enable her to do so &#8211; and when I say breast-feed I mean just that, I do not mean merely bottle-feeding expressed breast milk. Nothing less will meet the imperative demands of the European Convention. Contact two or three times a week for a couple of hours a time is simply not enough if parents reasonably want more.&#8221;</p>

Their importance is highlighted by <span style="font-style:italic">P, C and S v United Kingdom</span>, where the court criticised the manner in which a local authority implemented the EPO &#8211; it separated the child from the mother at birth &#8211; because it had not been shown that supervision of the mother and child in hospital would not have sufficed to protect the child from harm. There was a breach of Article 8 because the child was removed in circumstances where the local authority, although it had properly obtained an EPO, could not justify the steps it had taken <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> the order had been made. The court said:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[130]<marker name="tab"/>In the circumstances, the court considers that the decision to obtain the emergency protection order after S&#8217;s birth may be regarded as having been necessary in a democratic society to safeguard the health and rights of the child. The local authority had to be able to take appropriate steps to ensure that no harm came to the baby and, at the very least, to take the legal power to prevent C or any other relative removing the baby with a view to foiling the local authority&#8217;s actions, and thereby placing the baby at risk. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[132]<marker name="tab"/>The reasons put forward by the Government for removing the baby from the hospital, rather than leaving her with her mother or father under supervision, are that the hospital staff stated that they could not assure the child&#8217;s safety and alleged tensions with the family. No details or documentary substantiation of this assertion are provided. P, who had undergone a caesarean section and was suffering the after-effects of blood loss and high blood pressure, was, at least in the first days after the birth, confined to bed. Once she had left the hospital, she was permitted to have supervised contact visits with S. It is not apparent to the court why it was not at all possible for S to remain in the hospital and to spend at least some time with her mother under supervision. Even on the assumption that P might be a risk to the baby, her capacity and opportunity for causing harm immediately after the birth must be regarded as limited, considerably more limited than once she was discharged. Furthermore, on the information available to the authorities at that stage, P&#8217;s manifestation of the syndrome, sometimes known as MSBP, indicated a prevalence for exaggerating symptoms of ill-health in her children and that she had gone so far as to use laxatives to induce diarrhoea. Though the harm which such conduct poses to a child, particularly if continued over a long period of time cannot be underestimated, there was in the present case no suspicion of life-threatening conduct. This made the risk to be guarded against more manageable and it has not been shown that supervision could not have provided adequate protection against this risk, as was the case in the many contact visits over the months leading up to the care proceedings when both parents were allowed to feed the baby. </p>

As I have already observed, the Strasbourg court accepts that there may be situations justifying an ex parte application. Thus in <span style="font-style:italic">P, C and S v United Kingdom </span>the court specifically held (para [127]) that the local authority could not be criticised for using the ex parte procedure, and in <span style="font-style:italic">Covezzi and Morselli v Italy </span>the challenge failed even though the application had been made without notification to the parents. But in <span style="font-style:italic">Venema v The Netherlands</span>, where the order was made without notification to the parents, and without there having been any discussion with the parents, this lack of involvement was held (see paras [98]-99]) to have been a breach of Article 8, the parents having been presented with &#8220;a fait accomplis without sufficient justification&#8221;. Likewise in <span style="font-style:italic">Haase v Germany</span>, where there had been an ex parte application, the court held (see paras [96]-[105]) that there had in all the circumstances been a breach of Article 8.

Nor, as the Government point out, may it even be desirable, even if possible, to do so if those having custody of the child are seen as the source of an immediate threat to the child, since giving them prior warning would be liable to deprive the measure of its effectiveness. The court must however be satisfied that the national authorities were entitled to consider that there existed circumstances justifying the abrupt removal of the child from the care of its parents without any prior contact or consultation. In particular, it is for the respondent State to establish that a careful assessment of the impact of the proposed care measure on the parents and the child, as well as of the possible alternatives to the removal of the child from its family, was carried out prior to the implementation of a care measure.&#8221;</p>

Parents against whom an EPO is made ex parte are entitled to be given, if they ask, proper information as to what happened at the hearing and to be told, if they ask, (i) exactly what documents, bundles or other evidential materials were lodged with the FPC either before or during the course of the hearing and (ii) what legal authorities were cited to the FPC. The local authority&#8217;s legal representatives should respond forthwith to any reasonable request from the parents or their legal representatives either for copies of the materials read by the FPC or for information about what took place at the hearing. It will therefore be prudent for those acting for the local authority in such a case to keep a proper note of the proceedings, lest they otherwise find themselves embarrassed by a proper request for information which they are unable to provide.</p>

The mere fact that the local authority has obtained an EPO is not of itself enough. The FPC decides whether to make an EPO. But the local authority decides whether to remove. The local authority, even after it has obtained an EPO, is under an obligation to consider less drastic alternatives to emergency removal. Section 44(5) requires a process within the local authority whereby there is a further consideration of the action to be taken after the EPO has been obtained. Though no procedure is specified, it will obviously be prudent for local authorities to have in place procedures to ensure both that the required decision making actually takes place and that it is appropriately documented.</p>

He also told me that the team leader who took the decision to apply for EPOs without notice to the parents did so because she genuinely believed that, having notice of the material in these documents, there was a real possibility that the mother would administer medication to obscure the findings of the clinicians. It was not feasible to engage the parents in an alternative strategy involving their lawyers since, as far as the local authority was aware, the parents were not legally represented prior to the EPOs being obtained.</p>

There was, therefore, no objection to the fact that the local authority&#8217;s application was made ex parte.

Moreover, and to the extent that the matter proceeded before the FPC on the basis of oral evidence, a proper note of the hearing, and of the evidence in particular, should have been prepared by the local authority and made available to the parents. That was not done. Mr Ryder acknowledged that any reasons given for an ex parte process should have been reduced to writing and filed and served as soon as possible. By implication he accepted that there had been failings in this respect.</p>

But this was a family which had been known to the local authority for a very long time and it would have been perfectly feasible to prepare the appropriate evidence in time for the hearing. I do not wish to criticise Ms G, who is a social worker not a lawyer. Responsibility for these matters &#8211; the proper presentation of cases in court &#8211; lies with management and the legal department. But the point is an important one and I hope that lessons will be learnt &#8211; and not just by this local authority. And the importance of the point, if I may draw attention to the obvious, extends beyond the purely evidential aspect. The inadequacy of the local authority&#8217;s evidence reflected, as we shall see, what seems to me to have been the inadequacy of the local authority&#8217;s analysis of the case, and this in turn fed through into what equally seems to me to have been a failure by all concerned at the hearing on 17 January 2003 to address, as separate matters, the three key issues I have referred to. The point is elementary, but perhaps bears repetition: the very discipline of having to reduce one&#8217;s thinking, one&#8217;s analysis, one&#8217;s opinion, and the reasons for one&#8217;s opinion, to paper immeasurably improves the quality of what emerges.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have set out the local authority&#8217;s explanations at length because, if I may be forgiven for saying so, they reveal both the poverty of the local authority&#8217;s reasoning and what seems to have been the inadequacy of its decision-making processes. This was, as matters appeared on 17 January 2003, an appropriate case for medical examinations (including toxicology tests) and assessments of the children. It was moreover, as the FPC appropriately accepted, a case in which there appeared to be a real risk that the mother might interfere with the process. I accept, therefore, that this was a case in which CAOs were appropriate and possibly, though I am not so sure, even EPOs &#8211; these on the basis that the local authority may have needed to have parental responsibility to ensure that the medical examinations and tests proceeded without any hitches. (However, even if EPOs were appropriate, it is not at all obvious why there was any need for EPOs to be granted for more than 24 or possibly 48 hours; the medical tests and examinations had already been arranged for the same afternoon.) But it is far from clear to me that there was any justification for the removal of the children into foster care. After all, and as Ms G&#8217;s oral evidence had made clear, it was not contemplated that there would be any need to examine the children further after they had been examined and tested by Dr W on 17 January 2003. The further assessment was to be based, as Ms G explained it to the FPC, on an overview of the medical records by Dr W and a review by Dr S.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Part of the problem, I suspect, is that the local authority had not really thought through and properly analysed the case before it got to court on 17 January 2003. Moreover, it seems to have failed to address itself adequately &#8211; either then or later &#8211; to the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/44/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 44(5)</ref>. That in turn seems to have fed through into its seeming failure adequately to address itself to the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/44/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 44(10)</ref>. I was not surprised to hear Ms Hamilton asking rhetorically at the hearing on 3 November 2003 whether the local authority had even applied its mind to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/44/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 44(10)</ref>. Explaining the seeming delay in placing the children with the maternal grandparents, Mr Ryder said that there had been a proposal that the father would be assessed as a sole carer, but he withdrew from that proposal on 4 February 2003. &#8220;Thereafter&#8221;, as Mr Ryder puts it, the grandparents were approved. That, I have to say, does not seem to me to have been good enough, for it took, as I have said, until 28 February 2003 for the children to be placed with the grandparents. Even assuming that it had been appropriate to remove the children in the first place, there seems, despite Mr C&#8217;s endeavours, to have been lacking an appropriate sense of urgency. Both the overall delay from 17 January to 28 February 2003 and the later period of delay from 13 to 28 February 2003 are concerning. Can it really be said that the local authority exercised the exceptional diligence called for by Article 8?</p>

I repeat: arrangements for contact must be driven by the needs of the family, not stunted by lack of resources. If the State in the guise of a local authority is to interfere as drastically with family life as it does when it separates a child from its parents before it has even established the grounds for seeking a final care order then it must provide and facilitate appropriate contact. Too often one hears of cases where the contact offered is something of the order of two or three times a week for 1&#189; or 2 hours a time. Indeed, I hear it so often that it seems almost to be a rule of thumb. There will, of course, be cases where that is the appropriate frequency and duration of contact, but there will be many &#8211; I repeat, many &#8211; cases where it is not adequate and where, I fear, what is being offered is provided not because it is genuinely believed to be appropriate but because that is the most that a hard-pressed and under-resourced local authority can cope with.

And heavy-handedness is likely to be totally counter-productive, making it impossible for parents and local authority to &#8216;work together&#8217; productively in future. In the present case the consequence of the events of January 2003 was that the mother, as I was told on 3 November 2003, was not willing to agree to any order which did not provide for ongoing judicial monitoring.</p>
