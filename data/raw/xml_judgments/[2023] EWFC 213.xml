	    <p style="margin-left:0.69in">In January 2020 the wife filed a document within the family proceedings and in support of her application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref>, called &#8216;Points of Claim&#8217; in which she set out her case against the husband and [L].  She alleged that the loan agreement between the husband and [L] is a sham, created only after the marriage had broken down, and designed as a means of diverting a large part of the equity away from the assets that would otherwise fall to be considered within the proceedings for financial remedy.  The document concludes by seeking declarations from the Court that the loan agreement is a sham and has no legal and beneficial effect, alternatively that the loan agreement and subsequent charging order be set aside pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37(2)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.  In the further alternative, the Court is asked to find that the &#8216;documents&#8217; created in Nigeria have no legal effect in the UK, and the charging order should be set aside on that basis.</p>

The husband denies that the loan agreement is a sham, and asserts that the proceedings in Nigeria were legitimate.  The intervenor asserts that if the wife seeks to challenge the validity of the Nigerian proceedings, she should have done so within that jurisdiction.  It is noted that no application had been made to the High Court in England to set aside registration of the foreign judgment.  In the circumstances, the intervenor was entitled to enforce the judgment by way of a charge over the former matrimonial home, or any other asset of the husband.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I believe that confusion may stem from some misunderstanding of Master Eastman&#8217;s order.  His suggestion that the proceedings be transferred to the Family Division of the High Court appears to be on the basis that if the intervenor were to seek to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">enforce</span> the final charging order by applying for sale of the home, that application should be heard by the same judge as is considering the application for financial remedies.  The intervenor has not yet applied to enforce the charging order.  Master Eastman was plainly not suggesting that transfer to a judge of the Family Division (or a Circuit Judge with a s9 ticket) opened up the possibility of a Family Court judge making orders to set aside either the judgments made in the King&#8217;s Bench Division &#8211; the charging order, and the order registering the Nigerian judgment - nor the judgment obtained by the intervenor in the High Court of Nigeria.  However, the wife&#8217;s legal team appeared to be under this misapprehension.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In general terms, the wife&#8217;s case is clear.  She says the loan agreement was set up only after the husband and wife&#8217;s separation, with the intention only of stripping &#163;1.6 m of assets out of the matrimonial pot, in order to defeat her claim for financial remedy.  The loan agreement led to the Nigerian judgment, registered here and then secured by a charging order.  This sequence of actions has, she says, effectively transferred &#163;1.6 million of a beneficial interest in the property to the intervenor.  The wife&#8217;s case is that this transfer was for no consideration, because there never was a loan.  She asserts that even if the charging order is enforced by sale of the property, any proceeds would effectively be held by the intervenor on trust for the husband, to be returned to him once the financial remedy proceedings have concluded.</p>

Her work was housekeeping and working on reception.  She had some involvement in booking rooms and arranging for takings in cash to be collected and banked.  There was no evidence that she had any wider management, strategic or financial responsibilities in the business.  This puts her at some disadvantage in establishing her claim, because she was not able to give me direct evidence about the husband&#8217;s financial position.  She is reliant upon the information she says he gave to her.  On any view, he does not appear to have shared very much with her.  The wife told me that he had shown her financial documents, but she was not able to say what those documents were, or what they proved in support of her claim.  </p>

The combined value of these properties is said to be 1.255 billion Naira.  On 2009 exchange rates (Mr Holborn helpfully produced a schedule of exchange rates that has been agreed by all representatives) that would equate to &#163;6.6 million.  But on the figure I was given for today&#8217;s exchange rates that would equate to just under &#163;1.4 million.  The husband denies creating this document.  I am sceptical about his claim that his letterhead paper had been stolen and this document was a forgery.  This claim of theft was made for the first time in the witness box, and has never been alleged before.</p>

She said she believed he had no need to borrow, because he was a wealthy and influential man in Nigeria, and had run a successful business as a hotelier.

The parties have researched relevant exchange rates and that would amount to about &#163;10,000 a day, but that figure is not much good to me, firstly because the husband&#8217;s evidence was that occupancy was usually between somewhere between thirty and fifty percent, and secondly, because I was given no evidence about running costs, staff and all the other overheads associated with running a hotel.</p>

He gave clear and consistent evidence about the chronology of the family travelling to London, establishing the UK branch of his Nigerian hotel business [DS] shortly thereafter, buying first the family home and then the property called [the Red House], which he intended to develop into a small airport hotel, similar to that which he had operated in Nigeria.</p>

In his petition for divorce to the Nigerian Court, the husband sought an order that the wife and children be evicted from the property and rehoused in another one.  It would seem that the husband and, through his company, his brother, shared the same objective.

I do not accept that his hotel business was as wildly successful as she suggested.  I prefer his evidence that they lived in modest quarters at the back of the guesthouse and that she continued to work in the hotel after the marriage.  I would be prepared to accept that he was able to draw funds from his business in order to purchase [the Red House] and land for &#163;800,000.  But there is no evidence before the Court to enable me to find to the standard of a balance of probabilities that he did have access to the &#163;1.35 million and associated costs required to purchase the family home in cash.  It is for the wife to prove that the property was bought without recourse to a loan from the intervenor;</p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.19in">I accept the husband&#8217;s evidence that he entered the UK on Tier 1 (entrepreneur) visa.  In January 2009 this was a route available for migrants who wished to establish, join or take over one or more business in the UK.  That is exactly what the husband&#8217;s intention was.  Having successfully run small hotels in Nigeria and a hotel/boarding house near Lagos airport, his intention was to expand the business by creating a similar type of hotel near Heathrow airport.  I accept his evidence that the requirements that applied to him on a Tier 1 entrepreneur visa, were for him to have access to not less than &#163;200,000, to be held in a regulated financial institution, and that it was disposable in the UK; </p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.19in;text-indent:0.12in">It was asserted on behalf of the wife in her counsel&#8217;s position statement that the husband entered the UK on a Tier 1 (investor) visa, which among other things required the investor to have (i) not less than &#163;1 million in a regulated financial institution, disposable in the ; or (ii) &#163;2 million in net personal assets <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and</span> a loan disposable in the UK of not less than &#163;1 million loaned from a financial institution regulated by the Financial Services Authority.  The wife has not provided any evidence to support the assertion that the husband did enter on this visa, or that he was at any time able to satisfy those criteria.  The husband was indeed entering the UK with the intention of setting up a business, consistent with the Entrepreneur visa, he was not intending to invest in other businesses, nor did he.  In the circumstances, I reject the wife&#8217;s claim that the husband must have had at least &#163;2 million in cash in his bank account when he arrived in the UK;</p>

This could be evidence that the loan was a sham, but it is also consistent with the evidence of the husband and the intervenor, that the husband had not been honest and straightforward with his brother about how he was going to use the funds.  The loan agreement provides that the loan should be used to further the business, and repayments would start once the business was trading.  It was not intended as a mortgage.  In the circumstances, it would not be expected for the intervenor to register a charge on the property when the expectation was that the loan would be repaid once the business started trading; </p>

Its validity has not been challenged.  The statement shows the account in excess of &#163;360,000 on 11 September 2009, and over the next couple of months, a further &#163;333,000 coming into the account in five instalments from [Y Commodities].  On 30 November 2009 a payment of &#163;557,000 was made to [<span style="font-style:italic">name redacted</span>].  The husband gave evidence that this is the name of the solicitors&#8217; firm that did the conveyancing on the purchase of the family home (corroborated by correspondence within the bundle).  The husband and his brother gave evidence that [Y Commodities] was the foreign exchange service that was used in order to transfer the money from the intervenor&#8217;s account to the husband&#8217;s account.  The amounts and timings of these transfers are consistent with the husband&#8217;s account of receiving the monies in instalments, which in turn is consistent with the terms of the loan agreement which provides for payment to be made in a succession of instalments until the sum of &#163;1.6 million was reached;</p>

They are date stamped by the Nigerian Court.  I am told that the Court service performs a notary service to certify commercial documents as genuine.  It is of course possible that this is not the case, or that it is, and the documents have been back-dated and stamped using stamps obtained as part of a fraud.  However, I have not been shown any evidence to support such an assertion.  There is no expert evidence as to standard procedure for notarising contracts, as to the types of stamps used, nor any handwriting evidence in respect of signatures purporting to be those of the husband and the intervenor.  What I have been told is that these documents were accepted and approved by the High Court in Nigeria as valid evidence of a debt owed by the husband to the intervenor company, and judgment was entered on that basis.  In the circumstances, I must be cautious to come to a conclusion that they are fakes, fabricated only in the aftermath of the husband and wife&#8217;s separation; </p>

Costs should be paid on an indemnity basis because the wife alleged that the relevant transactions were a sham, effectively requiring both the husband and the intervenor to come to Court to defend themselves, and incur costs as a result.  In the event, the Court found that the wife had not proved her case.  Where there is any doubt in the assessment, in all the circumstances it should be resolved in favour of the receiving parties.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with Mr Holborn&#8217;s submissions in respect of the time for payment of the intervenor&#8217;s costs.  While the continuation of the financial remedy proceedings may well be a good reason to delay any steps taken to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">enforce</span> a costs order, it is not a good reason to delay the time for payment in the order.  It is helpful however that the intervenor has agreed not to seek enforcement of the order at this time. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not regard the application for permission to appeal as a good reason to defer the date for payment of costs.  I have not been asked to stay execution of my order.  It is open to the applicant to seek a stay of execution from the Appellate Court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I consider that the husband&#8217;s costs should not be subject to assessment until after the conclusion of the financial remedy proceedings.  In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Crowther</span>, the Court was concerned the parties&#8217; business interests which had been hived off to be dealt with as a discrete issue, separate from the financial remedy proceedings.  In this case the preliminary issue has concerned the former matrimonial home, which is at the heart of the financial remedy proceedings.  There is likely to be some overlap in respect of costs incurred for the preliminary issue and the main case, which will be better identified once those proceedings have ended.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, the husband has submitted a schedule for summary assessment.  The costs of his current solicitors and counsel&#8217;s fees amount to &#163;37,703.  There is then a further sum of &#163;170,917 sought in respect of &#8216;fees to other law firms as instructed by party&#8217;.  There is no explanation of what any of these fees relate to.  Further investigation is required, which is better done through the process of detailed assessment.</p>
