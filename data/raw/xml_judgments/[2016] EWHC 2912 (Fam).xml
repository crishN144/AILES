They are the two children of MB (the mother) and FB (the father); they currently reside at home with their parents together with their paternal grandmother.  In March 2014 I made a shared residence order in favour of all three adults in respect of the two children.  There is currently a supervision order in favour of the London Borough of Newham (&#8220;the Local Authority&#8221;); that order has been extended throughout these proceedings.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the fourth substantive judgment which I have delivered in this case, and for a complete understanding of the evolution of this litigation all should be read. The first judgment was delivered in July 2013 at the conclusion of a five-day fact-finding hearing (<span style="font-style:italic">Re AD &amp; AM (Finding of Fact: Non-Accidental Injury)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/4859" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 4859 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 4859 (Fam)</ref>); I there explained my finding that MB had inflicted near-fatal injuries on her son, who had suffered massive head wounds and spinal fractures.  In March 2014 I conducted a welfare hearing at the conclusion of which I delivered a judgment explaining my reasons for endorsing the Local Authority&#8217;s plan, supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian, to rehabilitate the subject children to the care of their parents and grandmother subject to strict conditions (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re AD &amp; AM (Non-Accidental Injury: Welfare)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/4899" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 4899 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 4899 (Fam)</ref>).  In March 2015, the Local Authority applied to the Family Court at East London for an extension of the supervision order, and in July 2015, within those proceedings, the mother applied for a re-hearing of the 2013 findings of fact.  The applications were transferred to the High Court and listed before me in January 2016; I delivered judgment on 24 February 2016 (<span style="font-style:italic">Re AD &amp; AM (Fact-Finding hearing) (Application for re-hearing)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/326" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 326 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 326 (Fam)</ref>) dealing with the mother&#8217;s application.  </p>

By that time, it was known that a piece of AD&#8217;s skull, removed in the life-saving operation in October 2012 and then lost, had been discovered; this fragment was believed to reveal significant features of woven bones, possible signs of vitamin D deficiency, and unusual thinness at the fracture site.  A number, eight in all, of additional medical experts (who were listed at [41] of the February 2016 judgment <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/326" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 326 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 326 (Fam)</ref>) had provided further opinion.

The Local Authority oppose the application, and contends that the evidence adduced in 2016 has proven the case more convincingly than the evidence adduced in 2013.  The Guardian retains an essentially neutral stance, but has been invaluable in co-ordinating some of the expert witnesses.  This re-hearing has required enormous effort on the part of the lawyers involved, whom I wish to credit for their endeavours.</p>

Mr. Storey QC and Mr. Bailey refined their objectives in this regard, importantly jettisoning any reliance on the evidence of Dr. Shaku Teas (Forensic Pathologist, Illinois, USA), whose views on a number of the medical issues attracted minimal if any support from any other expert. She had argued strongly that there had been a much older (possibly birth-related) fracture and a chronic bleed (which she dated to about the same time); that view, and other views, had attracted a certain degree of disparagement of other experts.  Indeed Mr. Richards expressed the view to me in his oral evidence that he thought that some of her opinions were &#8220;bizarre&#8221; and &#8220;showed an ignorance to what happens in life&#8221;. No party indicated an intention to rely on the evidence of Dr. Chris Van Ee, Biomedical Engineer, Michigan, USA, recognising the limits of biomechanical evidence in an enquiry such as this.  At the conclusion of submissions, I indicated to counsel that a proper basis had been made out for reconsidering the following issues:</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The father recounts that at about 4.30pm on 23 October 2012 he left AD and AM in the master bedroom while he went to fill a bucket in the bath to wash AM. He left AD sitting on the floor, propped up and surrounded by pillows. He was out of the room only long enough for the bucket to part-fill with water. He then heard AD cry &#8211; "not screaming, but quite a loud cry". On returning to the bedroom, he says that he found AD lying on his right-hand side on the floor. He said that he noticed that a Peppa Pig sit-on cart/scooter had moved; AD was lying close to the bed on his right hand side (facing away from the door), with his head about 12 to 15 inches from the table leg of the television table. AM (who had been sitting on the bed) was standing by the door. AD cried, he said for "a few minutes" (separately he estimated this at about 5-6 minutes). He said that he picked AD up, and carried him straight away downstairs; having left the bedroom he went downstairs without delay (AM following) and "by the time we were in the kitchen, he was not crying as loud; the crying stopped shortly after we got outside". On this description I would be surprised if the crying was as long as 5-6 minutes (&#8220;the 4.30 incident&#8221;) ([19]); I found that the 4.30pm incident indeed occurred ([94/95]);</p>

The fractures probably occurred as a result of excessive flexion of the spine. When asked about this at the hearing, Dr. Fairhurst expressed the view that these injuries were "a different 'kettle of fish' from the skull fracture; they occur <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">very</span> rarely" (emphasis in the oral evidence) and that "a major event results in these fractures". She postulated the circumstances in which an injury of this type might be suffered would be where a child was in a road traffic accident having being restrained in the vehicle only by a lap belt, adding that "we know that they occur where children fall from a great height onto their feet". Whatever the event would be it would not be an event that "a parent would forget about"&#8221; ([46] <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/4859" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 4859 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 4859 (Fam)</ref>).</p>

No one takes issue that osteopaenia was indeed observed to affect the spine on the X-rays taken on 31 October 2012.  Dr. Watt advised that the fact that osteopaenia was observable in the spine on the X-ray suggests that the bones were at least 20% demineralised (i.e. it has to be quite marked before it is noted radiologically), although he described the condition as &#8220;mild&#8221; in his report and in the experts meeting.  Dr. Hyman by contrast described the osteopaenia as &#8220;significant&#8221;, and one of the &#8220;worst cases&#8221; that he had seen.  The evidence of Dr. Fairhurst, which I accept (supported as it is by medical research), is that osteopaenia is more likely to affect, and therefore be identifiable in, the spine before other bones of the skeleton.</p>

This is important, given the view he expressed to the first meeting of experts in August 2016 that &#8220;you don&#8217;t get fractures unless there is radiological rickets&#8221;; this was a re-statement of the evidence he had given in 2013: the "tendency to fracture is not measured in frank rickets, let alone subtle" (see [61] <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/4859" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 4859 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 4859 (Fam)</ref>).

That all said, Prof Nussey, both in the experts meeting and in his oral evidence to me, deferred to the two histopathologists in this respect. As to which, Dr Cohen confirmed that there was &#8220;no indication&#8221; that this child was vitamin D deficient at the date of his admission to hospital, although opined that the woven bone indicated previous vitamin D deficiency; Prof Freemont confirmed no evidence of vitamin D deficiency on histological examination.  Interestingly Dr Fairhurst suggested that if AD were vitamin D deficient, to the extent that he had rickets, this would have the effect of softening the skull and potentially making it actually less likely to fracture than a skull unaffected by that condition; in this regard she cited the work of Prof Nick Bishop, the UK's only Professor of Paediatric Bone Disease, in Sheffield.</p>

Dr. Watt (from whom, of course, I did not hear in 2013) was of the view that osteopaenia would only occur after a period of 2-3 weeks&#8217; immobilisation; while it would be &#8220;possible&#8221; for it to occur after 7 to 8 days, it would not be &#8220;probable&#8221;; he acknowledged that it does occur in children admitted to intensive care for a short period of time, but this loss of bone density is generally minor and non-persistent. Dr Cartlidge similarly considered at this hearing that it was unlikely that immobility and/or steroid treatment could have caused the osteopaenia (he explained that if the demineralisation had been due to immobilisation, then this would normalise once AD was up and about again, which would in fact be consistent with the normal X-ray findings in 2015).  Prof Nussey shared Dr Cartlidge&#8217;s view that immobility and/or steroid treatment were unlikely to have caused the osteopaenia; he felt that the studies of patients experiencing prolonged bed rest and/or loss of gravity described in the medical literature were not of any great value in understanding the cause of osteopaenia in this case, specifically in relation to a child of this age.  </p>

She considered that immobility and/or steroid prescription were a reasonable explanation for the osteopaenia, in the absence of any other identified cause; she was of the view that these factors had certainly contributed to it even if they did not provide the entire explanation. Dr. Fairhurst opined that given the &#8220;present medical knowledge, it is going to be extremely difficult if not impossible to determine what contribution the immobility played in the osteopaenia&#8221; (evidence in chief).  Dr. Fairhurst commented that in a growing infant, a period of immobility can cause &#8220;rapid&#8221; demineralisation, because the body is not accreting minerals as it should in order to grow, and the immobility affects the absorption of minerals.  She could offer no explanation for the osteopaenia other than the immobilisation; she felt that whatever else was found, the immobility would have made a &#8220;not insignificant&#8221; contribution over eight days to the finding of osteopaenia.  </p>

Dr. Fairhurst did not make this finding, in that she did not interpret the X-ray appearances in the same way so as to identify osteopaenia in the long bones; this may to some extent be referable to the fact that &#8220;radiographs are an insensitive modality for the assessment of bone density in children&#8221; (per Dr. Watt).</p>

None of the experts could quantify the extent of the bony vulnerability. Prof Freemont observed in the experts meeting that if there is metabolic bone disease, it should affect all of the bones but maybe not equally.  Dr Fairhurst (supported in this regard by Dr. Cohen and Prof Freemont) advised the court that the skull bone forms in a different way from the long bones &#8211; the skull bones form from fibrous tissue (see Y449); put another way, &#8220;the ossification of the skull is intramembranous ossification (which) is different from the endochondral ossification that goes on in the other long bones like the wrist.&#8221; (per Dr. Cohen).

In any event, the small pockets or islands of woven bone would not, in their opinion, have led to a reduction in bone strength.  These are all important points of agreement.  Dr. Watt confirmed that there was no pathology in the skull, and no evidence of vitamin D deficiency or rickets at the time of admission to hospital, a view shared by Dr. Cartlidge; Dr Cartlidge, Dr Cohen, Prof Freemont and Prof Nussey all further agreed that AD did not have a significantly weak skull. Dr. Hyman profoundly disagreed with this view; he was of the clear view (as he explained in his oral evidence) that woven bone is thinner than lamellar bone, and argued that the skull was therefore inherently weak.</p>

As Mr Richards put it in the second experts meeting: &#8220;if the court determines the bone was weaker for metabolic reasons, then, yes, it&#8217;s common sense to say that less force may have a greater effect&#8230; if it&#8217;s (the skull) weaker than normal, it may affect the outcome.&#8221;  He referred later to this &#8216;common sense&#8217; approach as &#8216;theoretical&#8217;.</p>

He suggested that at 4.30pm, with the father briefly out of the room, AM could have picked her baby brother (AD) up, and dropped him (more or less 2&#8217;) head-first onto the metal leg of the TV base.  This proposition had been ventilated first at the first experts meeting, having been flagged in Dr. Hyman&#8217;s report: he there had expressed the view that a normal skull could fracture at a free-fall distance of 2 feet, and that conceivably a fracture may occur with a fall of less distance if the skull was more fragile than usual. However, he later conceded that he had only &#8220;occasionally&#8221; (on about two or three occasions during his career), come across babies with a fractured skull from falls of this distance adding: &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember the extent of that fracture, whether it&#8217;s as severe as it is in this case, and of course we wouldn&#8217;t know whether it propagated through the fibrous suture because we won&#8217;t see that on an X-ray&#8230;&#8221;; he further drew on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> century research on cadavers, and on Dr. Van Ee&#8217;s experiments.  Although he postulated in oral evidence that AD may have fallen against the long metal leg of the television stand, he had in fact earlier opined that the fracture was consistent with impact with a flat or near flat object (i.e. a floor), a view shared by Prof Freemont.</p>

The fruits of this research were limited to short extracts from the police interviews, where the mother confirmed that she would not allow AM to pick up AD.

Mr. Richards agreed that such fractures (and subdural bleeds) do occur but that those fractures at birth to which he referred are generally &#8220;very short linear&#8221; fractures, not of the scale/size of the fracture on AD&#8217;s parietal bone.  He accepted that there were some indicators of general unwellness in AD the period after 4.30pm (crying for 5-6 minutes, vomit after the feed, possibly a dose of ibuprofen given, see [17(x)] above) but felt that these were not particular indicators of anything sinister; he advised that it was &#8220;inconceivable&#8221; that AD would have suffered his near-catastrophic injury at 4.30 yet gone on to be assessed by the grandfather at 5.30pm as essentially normal, and then go on to eat some supper and have a bath.   Specifically he opined that the severity of the injuries particularly when viewed in combination contra-indicated a lucid interval; he said that he found it &#8220;difficult to accept&#8221; that the baby would have been conscious after sustaining these injuries, and equally inconceivable that, if conscious, he would have been able to feed; later in his evidence, in answer to questions from Miss Cook, he said that &#8220;it would be very, very, very unusual if [the baby] was not unconscious&#8221; immediately after suffering injuries of the kind suffered by AD, &#8220;and if conscious, [he] would not be eating and bathing normally&#8221;.  He commented that the &#8220;whole neurological picture&#8221; was &#8220;incompatible&#8221; with a lucid interval; he had expected any conscious infant to have been &#8220;inconsolable until his level of consciousness took the pain away&#8221;.

His thesis had initially been put rather tentatively in the experts meeting: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that one can absolutely say that the event has to happen right before the paramedics came&#8221;, but it gained in momentum as the meeting progressed, developing to a confident assertion by the end that there was indeed a lucid interval between 4:30pm and 8.00pm. In his oral evidence he described it as a &#8220;neurological cascade&#8221; befalling the child in the period after the 4.30pm incident.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have considered the evidence adduced at this hearing with considerable care.  I have thought it right to set out the medical debate extensively above to demonstrate the scope and range of the views expressed.  The evidence has been technical, and has been meticulously and thoroughly picked over by counsel.  The quality of the expert evidence has generally been of a high quality. This is a case in which, in the end, much turned on the extent to which I would accept the broadly contrary views of Dr. Hyman.  I studied his evidence thoroughly, but considered that his contributions &#8211; both as to his views on the precise science as much as his overall approach &#8211; were less helpful than the contributions of his medical colleagues.  I say so for the following reasons, in combination:</p>

In a relatively short section of the expert&#8217;s meeting, he glided from a description of the 4.30pm incident as the cause of the injuries as a &#8220;rare&#8221; occurrence, and a &#8220;possibility&#8221;, to a more confident &#8220;I think that&#8217;s the answer since we have a history&#8221;; he then slid back to describing the 4.30pm incident as &#8220;possible&#8221; (&#8220;possible is a proper term&#8221;), before repeating: &#8220;you have a history and you have a possibility that it occurs and there is no, you know, objective reason why the family is lying&#8221;, then on to &#8220;I think it&#8217;s probable that the parents history and the findings happened (sic)&#8221;, and finally: </p>

He postulated that AD had suffered a seizure causing an &#8220;uncontrolled movement&#8221; which contributed to his head impact, for which there was no neurological or other evidence; his description of the events of the evening of 23 October are partial, not reflecting the many ways in which AD was observed to behave normally during the critical period between 4.30pm and 9.30pm;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That osteopaenia was identified in X-rays of AD&#8217;s spine is not in doubt; the extent of it is more contentious.  Overall, I was impressed by the evidence of Dr. Watt who spoke with authority and balance on the issues; he described the osteopaenia as &#8220;mild&#8221;.  Dr. Hyman considered it to be more significant than that, but he is not of course a radiologist, and had indeed deferred to a colleague on issues of radiology when preparing his evidence.  I accept that Dr. Watt had observed evidence of osteopaenia in the long bones of the skeleton, through lucencies of the metaphyses on X-ray; these lucencies had been observed by Dr. Fairhurst but not interpreted by her in the same way, which she ascribes to an essentially subjective assessment of the bony structures using a blunt instrument.  Insofar as there is evidence of osteopaenia elsewhere than the spine, I am prepared to accept Dr. Watt&#8217;s opinion, though consider that such evidence as there was of osteopaenia in the long bones, it was of a very modest nature.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence which has been filed and called for this hearing has caused me to review my conclusion as to the cause of the osteopaenia.  Challenge is now raised to my earlier finding that the bony changes observed in the X-ray on 31 October would have been caused by a combination of immobility and steroid prescription in the immediately preceding 8-day period; indeed, this would not now accord with the clinical experience of any of the experts called.  Of the limited medical research papers available to me, none (with the possible exception of Giangregorio and Blimkie (2002)) support such a short degree of immobility as a likely cause of this condition.  The preponderance of the evidence (certainly from Dr. Watt, Dr. Cartlidge and Professor Nussey) is that a period of no less than 2-3 weeks of immobility would need to elapse before osteopaenic changes would be observed; Dr. Watt (as I indicated above) regards it as only &#8216;possible&#8217; but certainly not &#8216;probable&#8217; that an 8-day period may cause a degree of mild osteopaenia.  Dr. Fairhurst makes a strong case that immobility remains a distinctly possible, if not probable, cause, having regard (in combination) to the fast growing bones at AD&#8217;s young age, causing the loss of accretion and absorption; her position appears to be supported to some extent by the paper of Giangregorio and Blimkie (2002) (&#8220;Skeletal Adaptations to Alterations in Weight-Bearing Activity: a comparison of models of disuse osteoporosis&#8221;) which addresses the demineralisation of bones in rats, indicating that (a) a short period of immobilisation can result in significant mineral loss in the growing skeleton and, (b)&#160;vertebral mineral loss, at least in their experiment, occurred at nearly twice the rate it did in the tibia.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a child who was not known to be particularly mobile, it is possible of course that the osteopaenic changes (cause by a degree of immobility) had commenced in the spine before 24 October.  I draw from my earlier factual findings (see [14] on <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/4859" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 4859 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 4859 (Fam)</ref>) that the maternal grandmother had referred to AD as not making &#8220;any effort to do things; he was lethargic&#8221;; she said that if anyone tried to encourage him to move he would cry. Later she said that he "didn't enjoy making the effort" to mobilise, and that it would be unusual for him to mobilise without encouragement (see [71(i)] of the 2013 judgment).  All of this makes it possible that the mineralisation deficits were the result of &#8211; or as Dr. Fairhurst made clear materially contributed to &#8211; a degree of immobility over a period of time which preceded 23 October.    This was suggested in the submissions, not having been actively explored in the evidence, and I cannot (and do not) attribute weight to it as a theory.</p>

None of these can be said to be probable causes.  We do know that in 2015 the long bones were seen, on two occasions, to be normal which contra-indicates any pervasive disease or disorder.  I am attracted by the view that the low level of mineralisation seen on 31 October 2012 was an extreme variant of normal, as advocated by Dr. Cartlidge and Professor Nussey, but cannot regard this, without more, as the probable explanation.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Without an identified cause for the osteopaenia, I must look with care at the evidence which may suggest low mineralisation in other bones of the skeleton, including &#8211; most significantly &#8211; the skull.  As earlier indicated, there remains controversy over the superficially attractive logic, or medical reasoning, that bone weakness in the spine necessarily involves bone weakness in all other bones including the skull; however not all of the experts agree with this proposition (notably Prof Freemont and Dr. Fairhurst). Against a background of a finding that there is some very modest bone weakness in the long bones (see [75] above), I must consider the evidence in relation to the skull with particular care.  For a number of reasons, six in all, I have reached the conclusion that the bone weakness identified in the spine has not affected, or materially affected, the skull.  I say so for the following reasons in combination:</p>

First, in view of my finding above, I am satisfied that AD&#8217;s skull was of normal or essentially normal strength, and it follows that (even on Dr. Cartlidge&#8217;s view) the fall would really need to have been of a height of 2&#8217; or more in order to inflict the observed damage; even then, it would be an unusually but not unprecedentedly low, height from which a child would need to fall to be likely to suffer injuries of this kind.  Given the diastatic nature of the skull fracture, I prefer Prof Freemont&#8217;s view that the forces required are greater than those in the hypothesis described above (see [58] above), and that a fall of 5&#8217; or more would be more likely.

Frankly, with the exception of the evidence of Dr. Hyman to which I turn in a moment, the evidence was as strong if not stronger on this point at this hearing.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This was not a case in which the range and seriousness of the injuries would be likely to remain clinically silent; these were not fractures and subdural bleeds of a type or extent which are sometimes known to have occurred at birth &#8211; in so concluding, I have in mind Mr. Richards&#8217; answers to Mr. Storey in cross-examination (see [63] above), and the Whitby, Griffiths, Rutter et al paper of 2003, the Looney, Smith et al paper of 2007, and the Rooks et al paper of 2008 all which was referred to during the evidence and in submissions.  Overall I conclude that AD was relatively normal after the 4.30pm incident.  He may have been niggly; the mother may have thought that he was teething, and given him ibuprofen, but I accept Mr. Richards&#8217; evidence, supported by Dr. Cartlidge, that these were not signs of any sinister and profound evolving brain and subdural damage brewing under a seriously injured skull.  I further accept the evidence of Mr. Richards and Dr. Cartlidge that AD would have been likely to have become almost immediately unconscious following the trauma &#8211; and insofar as he was conscious at all (which would be &#8220;very, very, very unusual&#8221;: see [63]) it would have been for a short period of acute and exquisite pain rendering him &#8220;inconsolable until his level of consciousness took the pain away&#8221; (ibid.).  </p>

He was isolated in his views as to the length of the fracture and its direction (through the suture) which perhaps reflected his lack of expertise in the interpretation of the radiology, and/or a lack of objectivity demonstrated by the circumstances in which he accepted his instruction.  In fairness to Dr. Hyman, he had given a rather more realistic appraisal of the likelihood of a lucid interval in his written report (see [68]) and at an earlier stage of the second experts&#8217; meeting (&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that one can absolutely say that the event has to happen right before the paramedics came&#8221;) than his resting point revealed at its conclusion, and in his oral evidence to me.  He placed reliance on the Denton paper (see above), but as earlier pointed out, this described a rare phenomenon &#8211; an outlier.</p>

I am conscious that it is not for the parents to prove that there was a lucid interval, Mr Storey nonetheless suggested that I may prefer the case advanced by the parents by following one of two essential routes: either (a) I prefer the evidence of &#8216;neurological cascade&#8217; of Dr Hyman over the evidence of Mr Richards and Dr Cartlidge, or (b) I conclude that there are sufficiently unusual features of this particular case to treat it as &#8220;an outlier&#8221;.  I have already explained (see [73] above) why I regarded Dr Hyman as less satisfactory and convincing as an expert witness than the English counterparts who have given evidence before me in this hearing; that aside, I am satisfied that both Mr. Richards and Dr. Cartlidge have objectively re-evaluated the conclusions which they formed in 2013, from positions of great authority and current clinical experience, and have arrived at the same location.  I venture to suggest that they did so with greater confidence. I am unable to say that there are any, or any material, unusual features of AD&#8217;s presentation to justify the conclusion that this case should be treated as an exception to the general, accepted, and expected medical norm.</p>

The evidence is that the swelling could develop over a number of hours. The key evidence is that of Mr Richards and Dr Cartlidge who expressed the view that if the recording of the paramedic was &#8220;robust&#8221;, this would be more consistent with a very recent incident. I do regard that recording as reliable, or, to use Dr Cartlidge&#8217;s word, &#8220;robust". I say so because it entirely accords with the absence of swelling at 5:30pm, and the continued evolution of the boggy swelling in hospital after AD&#8217;s admission.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having found earlier in this judgment that there is no proper basis for concluding that AD&#8217;s skull was thin, or materially weakened by disease or deficiency, I maintain my finding that the forces required to cause the extensive fracture must be significant and in the absence of any account of an event of the severity to cause such catastrophic injury, further conclude that they must be non-accidental.  I reject the theory that there has been a lucid interval, for the reasons set out above, and accordingly, my finding at [109] (<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/4859" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 4859 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 4859 (Fam)</ref>) that it was the mother who inflicted these serious injuries to her infant son, AD must also stand.  The summary of factors which inform this conclusion remain intact, save that in place of &#8220;unambiguous&#8221; in [108](iii), I would now say &#8220;significantly preponderant&#8221; to reflect the fact that Dr. Hyman did not agree with the views of his medical colleagues.  I remain of the view that I should not be drawn into speculating on precisely how AD&#8217;s head was injured.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in">In view of my inability now to identify the cause of the osteopaenia in the spine, I cannot say whether AD was affected by this condition, and if so to what extent, in the days, weeks and/or even months prior to 23 October.  I cannot rule out that he may have had the condition for some time. Lesser forces would have been required to cause him to suffer thoracic vertebral fractures if his spine was hypodense in the way described by the radiologists.  I am no longer satisfied that the vertebral and skull fractures were caused in the same incident (see [112] of the 2013 judgment), and in view of my current findings, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that these thoracic fractures were non-accidental.  I therefore withdraw that finding.    Having done so, I have re-considered the evidence relevant to the skull fracture, and reflected on whether it affects my view of causation.  I am satisfied that it does not. </p>

He must, as the family must, live with the sad and highly regrettable truth of what happened to him.   </p>
