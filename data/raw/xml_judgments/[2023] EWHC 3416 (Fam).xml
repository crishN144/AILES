To preserve confidentiality of her identity and that of her family, I will identify her as X. Her circumstances make for a sad and tragic reading. I have summarised these below. X is the subject of an application by an NHS Hospital Trust (the &#8216;Trust&#8217;) for permission to invoke the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction and to seek permission to deprive her of her liberty. Latterly she has become the subject of a similar application by the Local Authority together with an application for public law orders. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">X was born to a loving family and until her preteen years, her life was unremarkable. Later, concerns around bullying caused her local CAMHS to support her. When she was twelve years old, she was admitted to the hospital with concerns about self-harm, suicidal ideation and low mood. Later she was assessed to be at a high risk of suicide. She was admitted on three further occasions during that year. Later, the local authority closed her case and sign posted the family to private therapy and support from the school. </p>

On one occasion she left her home during the night and was found some distance away walking in her socks, cold and wet. She has expressed a wish to die, reported hearing voices and becoming increasingly violent including direct assault on her parents and self-harming. X also started to place herself at risk by sexual association with older individuals, consuming alcohol and taking a constellation of illicit drugs. There then followed a period of further significant deterioration in her presentation that has at times necessitated the use of physical restraint and sedation to ensure her safety.</p>

It was determined that medication has had little positive effect on X. Furthermore, her behavioural difficulties were safeguarding concerns and not rooted in any mental health disorder. Moreover, an inpatient admission was not a solution and likely to be contrary to her therapeutic needs. However, due to a lack of suitable available placements, X continues to reside in a separate room at the hospital where she is supervised by three professionals, prompting the Trust to apply for authorisation by this court to permit the said Trust to deprive X of her liberty. </p>

The guardian in particular raised some searching questions and significant concerns about the local authority&#8217;s decisions. The guardian also questioned why the local authority had not made an application for public law orders. Whilst recognising the limitations placed upon the individual social workers and the local authority, the parents raised significant concerns about their daughter and the failures of the system as whole to provide her with any adequate services. By the time of the next hearing on 8 December 2023, the local authority applied for public law orders and permission to invoke the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction so that it may be authorised to deprive X of her liberty. </p>

The local authority has conducted an exhaustive search of over two hundred registered placements and it has been unable to identify a single placement that is willing to accept or suited to accommodate X. Consequently, the local authority now plans to place X in an unregistered placement pending an application to Ofsted for the placement to become registered.</p>

I have been provided with a detailed transition plan that requires further authorisation to deprive X of her liberty during her transport to the new proposed placement. These are in line with those that have been authorised during her stay at the hospital but include the additional use of an ambulance to transport her. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There can be no doubt that the restrictions that are currently placed on X and if approved, will continue to be place upon her, constitute a clear deprivation of her liberty. Her circumstances clearly meet the &#8216;acid test&#8217; as she is confined to her room and under constant supervision by three adult professionals. The proposed arrangements both in respect of her transfer to and whilst at her new placement all continue to confine her within a limited defined space and by constant supervision. X does not and cannot give consent to these arrangements as she does not have the capacity to do so and the confinement is clearly imputed to the State in the form of the Trust and the local authority who seek the court&#8217;s authorisation. Therefore, I must conclude that the current arrangements and the proposed arrangements for X&#8217;s transfer and residence in her new placement meet the acid test and that she is and will be deprived of her liberty.</p>

The local authority has now identified a placement that as consequence of considerable effort by the local authority and the professionals involved can be tailored to meet X&#8217;s needs. The placement is not registered with Ofsted, but urgent appropriate applications are being made to address this in accordance with the President of the Family Division&#8217;s Guidance of 2019 and its 2020 addendum. </p>

Given the limited available options, the condition of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;imperative considerations of necessity&#8221; </span>is entirely satisfied. Furthermore, in my judgment, X&#8217;s welfare demands that she moves to the proposed placement as a matter of urgency. X&#8217;s wishes and feeling are important but must be considered in the context of her maturity and inability to make informed safe decisions about her own welfare. The change of placement is a significant change for X but it is a necessary change that is demanded by her welfare interest. Subject to a settling in period and the staff being able to build a trusting relationship with X, her move is intended to be a prelude to her accessing appropriate services, including those that will best meet her emotional and educational needs. X&#8217;s relationship with her parents will be maintained through direct contact with her parents which will be promoted by the local authority.</p>

For the duration of her stay in the hospital, there is no option but to approve the continuation of the existing restrictive regime that has already been approved by the court to ensure her safety. Once at the new placement, X will require a high degree of restriction and support to keep her safe and the permissive measures that are sought by the local authority are entirely proportionate which currently present the least restrictive measures that would keep X safe.</p>

The transition plan is well thought out, necessary and entirely proportionate for meeting X&#8217;s needs. The success of the local authority&#8217;s care plan is predicated on a successful transition and in my judgment this must be supported by the restrictive measures that the Trust has sought permission to put in place. Therefore, I permit the restrictions that the Trust has applied for to support and implement the transition plan. Given that X will now be the subject of an interim care order, I accept the parties&#8217; invitation to allocate the case to a court that is local to the parties where the matter can benefit from judicial continuity. </p>

She is one of many children who are the subject of similar applications before this court. There is a common thread that binds these children. They do not easily fit the criteria of established services. These children and the adults supporting them face a gargantuan and at times an insurmountable challenge to finding a safe placement that can cater for their needs. A suitable and stable placement is key to meeting their therapeutic, educational, emotional and educational needs. Without a suitable placement, they are usually lost in the ever increasing gaps between services that are provided through different public bodies. </p>

Furthermore, there is a significant impact on the front line professionals who are often not trained to deal with these children&#8217;s specific needs and presentation. In the instant case, the nurses involved have been fearful for their safety. They have become anxious, emotional and suffered with stress. Such has been the impact on them that through its in-house psychologist team, the Trust has provided them with break out and debriefing sessions.</p>

She has been residing in a room that is usually used for treating acute conditions and during the more recent busy periods, this has added to the waiting time for other patients, with some patients having to be transferred to other hospitals. None of this is X&#8217;s fault. She and many children like her require access to suitable placements. The time to address this silent crisis is long overdue and requires urgent attention.</p>
