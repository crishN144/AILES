He says that 'the document' is likewise protected by the without prejudice principle from being referred to in an open context.  The wife's responses are multiple but are essentially that the without prejudice protection does not attach here and/or that if it would have attached, the protection was waived by the husband, thereby entitling her to refer to the contents of the document concerned.  </span></p>

On the wife's case, she had been habitually resident in this jurisdiction for a year before issuing a petition here on 2</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> April 2013.  The husband says that this is untrue.  He maintains that the wife is forum shopping.  If the wife is correct, the English court has jurisdiction.  If not, and if the husband is right, the English court does not have jurisdiction.  Needless to say, what lies behind this expensive jurisdictional struggle is money.  If the English court has jurisdiction, both parties expect the wife to do much better in consequential financial remedy proceedings than if the proceedings take place in &#8216;country  X&#8217;, where the husband himself has also issued proceedings for divorce.  </span></p>

The wife has been represented by Mr. Hodge Malek QC and Mr. Alexander Thorpe.  Although their cases are poles apart, each counsel has put his client's case before me calmly, cogently and persuasively.  I&#160;am grateful for this in circumstances where, from the relatively little I&#160;have seen of the case, it seems to be being run in a pretty combative way.  Both parties have made long and tendentious statements which, again from the little I&#160;have seen, have not been restricted to the provision of evidence but have slipped into arguing the case.</span><span/><span style="font-size:14pt">Before turning to the brief background, I&#160;emphasise that nothing I&#160;say arising out of this interlocutory hearing is intended to constitute or be read as any sort of definitive finding of fact.

They married in 2002.  There are no children of the family.  The husband is a highly-paid higher executive officer of a well known financial institution and is responsible for a number of countries.  The parties lived a rich international lifestyle:  the husband travelling with his work, and the wife travelling with her passionate interest in contemporary art.  Hence the parties were not routinely together at one obvious fixed base, as most couples conventionally are.  </span></p>

In that petition he asserts the wife's habitual residence to be in England (sic), which the wife says was doing nothing more than recognising the truth.  The husband and his country  X lawyer, Mr. C, however, say that this was a fiction necessitated by the need to avoid the risk of the country  X courts concluding (if the petition had asserted that the wife lived in country  X) that the parties had not yet been apart for one year, that being a condition precedent in country  X to one being able to obtain a divorce.

I&#160;arranged for a draft agreement to be prepared which I&#160;wanted to discuss with BE.  This was, in effect, a 'post-nuptial' agreement.  My intent was that finances would be taken out of the equation so that BE and I&#160;could concentrate on trying to rebuild our relationship and save our marriage.

The starting-point is that written or oral communications made in a genuine attempt to settle a dispute between the parties will not generally be admitted into evidence:  Phipson paras.24-09 and 24-13.  The policy is that parties should be encouraged to settle their disputes without resort to litigation and such that they can speak freely:  </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Cutts v.

A first unsolicited letter offering settlement or negotiations marked 'without prejudice' will as a matter of policy therefore be protected; and so it is that the without prejudice principle is said to rest partly (a) on that public policy just mentioned and partly (b) on an express or implied agreement between the parties that they will not later rely in an open context on the contents of settlement negotiations.

This hearing has in any event not been set up for any examination of the parties' respective subjective views of what was happening or intended to happen on 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> April 2013 (ie according to the husband, a start of negotiations by way of his giving the wife 'the document', as his offer; and, according to the wife, a cynical ambush to bully and coerce her into conceding the country X property regime and giving up many of her rights).  I&#160;therefore have to and shall determine the issue on the paper evidence of the parties, which will almost always be the appropriate approach in any event, if the proper test is an objective one.  </span></p>

Whilst this clearly does not require the existence of legal proceedings, it must surely mean a reasonably cohate and definable issue or series of issues, not just a number of reciprocal differences or grievances which might or might not prove soluble with reflection and discussion.  The husband says he was endeavouring to settle the wife's financial claims, but she had not yet made any (except purely formally in her petition, of which the husband was unaware).  He speaks of a separation and of a potential divorce, although he was still hoping to avoid it.  According to the wife, she for her part was wanting to save the marriage and to work out a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">modus vivendi</span><span style="font-size:14pt">.  For her, this was just an unhappy couple discussing their marriage difficulties over dinner.  Each had, it is true, issued a petition but as I&#160;have said neither knew so.  Therefore they could not have been addressing that and, in any event, their motivations in issuing their petitions were merely &#8216;protective&#8217;.  In all the circumstances, I&#160;am not persuaded that there was as yet in existence a dispute or sufficiently definable dispute between this couple which the law envisages and requires for the without prejudice protection to attach.  </span></p>

It must be necessary from what I&#160;have said above that both parties realised or must or should have realised this, not just the person now praying in aid the without prejudice protection.  The husband avers that the wife was &#8216;fully aware&#8217; that they were meeting to discuss settlement; but, without deciding anything definitively, I&#160;have to read that assertion against the background of his seemingly self-serving attitude towards establishing jurisdiction in the country X court, as referred to at paragraphs 7 and 8 above.  The wife says she had no idea that this dinner was intended as a negotiating opportunity.  They were, as I&#160;have said, in her eyes, a married couple with marital difficulties out to dinner.  It was not a meeting in an office, nor with an agenda, nor (depending on the resolution of the factual issues at the hearing in July 2014) with advance notice to the wife of the likelihood of an offer.  The husband, according to the wife, just produced 'the document' (which I&#160;accept was in the nature of an offer) and then subjected her to pressure to sign it.  I&#160;do not consider in the overall context that it is shown to have been clear from the surrounding circumstances that the parties were seeking to compromise any dispute which (strictly on this hypothesis) existed.  Nor for that matter on the current state of the evidence (although this may change at the jurisdiction hearing) does it look as though this occasion represented a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">bona fide</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> attempt by the husband to settle, as distinct from an attempt to impose.  To be truly </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">bona fide</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, should he not have disclosed to the wife the fact of his country X petition?  (The wife's not having disclosed to him the fact of her English petition is nothing to the point, since it is not her case that this was an occasion to explore settlement.)  The husband has been on notice from an early stage (as seen in the summary of evidence above) of the wife's case that he was not negotiating but seeking to impose his will on her, but has not answered it in his written evidence.  </span></p>

I&#160;do not consider any question of waiver arises for so long as the wife was only referring to the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">fact of</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> the dinner on 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> April 2013 and to the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">fact of</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> the husband's having produced &#8216;the document&#8217; for her to sign.  As Mr.&#160;Bishop says, that does not offend the without prejudice principle, where it is engaged.  Hence, it was not waiver by the husband for him not to have taken the "without prejudice" point in answer to the wife's earlier affidavits.  I&#160;am with Mr. Bishop there.  Where I&#160;part company with him is in respect of para.113 of the husband's affidavit of 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> March 2014.

It would be unfair in my judgment for the husband to &#8216;blow hot and cold&#8217; by being able to deploy the without prejudice protection (which on this hypothesis would exist) so as to avoid such exploration being done by meaningful cross-examination.  Meaningful cross-examination would mean the court having the opportunity to evaluate the husband's assertion as against the content of 'the document'.  In a late comment during his submissions, Mr. Bishop said, for good measure, that I&#160;could require the husband to redact para.113 from his affidavit, but I&#160;consider that the issue has come further than that by this stage, and I&#160;do not propose to take up that suggestion.  </span></p>
