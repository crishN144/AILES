Although the notice of appeal raised a number of complaints, the focus of the appeal, as argued before me, has been the specific issue order which concerned the choice of schools for the older boy, I.  The judge&#8217;s order provided that, when he leaves primary school at the end of this academic year, I should go to an Islamic school, which I shall refer to as &#8220;School A&#8221; as proposed by the mother.  The father&#8217;s preference is that he should go to a circular school which I shall refer to as &#8220;School B&#8221;.</span></p>

I am not deciding this matter afresh as if I were hearing it as the judge at first instance.  I am hearing an appeal against the judge&#8217;s decision.  An appeal will only succeed if the father satisfies me that Judge Rylance&#8217; decision was wrong or, alternatively, unjust, because of a procedural or other irregularity. Before the appeal proceeds, the father must obtain permission to appeal.  That will only be granted when the court concludes that there is a real prospect of the appeal succeeding, or there is some other compelling reason for the appeal to proceed.</span></p>

The father is aged forty-four and works as a marketing director.  The mother is aged forty-seven and works in planning.  They married in 2004 and had the two boys as stated in 2006 and 2010.  The mother is a Muslim and on the parties&#8217; marriage the father converted to Islam.  The mother has an adult daughter by a previous relationship.</span></p>

Whilst there, I was enrolled, for a time, in a fee-paying Islamic school.  In 2013, the parties separated and was granted an Islamic divorce.  In January 2015, the parties reached an agreement in respect of the children&#8217;s arrangements, which was ratified by a court in Australia.  It provided for the children to live with the mother and spend time with the father.  It further provided that the mother and boys would return to the United Kingdom, which they duly did in March 2015.  The father also returned to this country later that year.</span></p>

This is an important part of the family&#8217;s identity and must be nurtured.&#8221;</span></p>

In the , that third option fell away in the course of the negotiation in proceedings.</span></p>

When the parties were unable to agree this issue, the mother in July 2016 filed an application for a specific issue order that I should attend School A.  A fortnight later, the father filed an application for a child arrangements order in respect of both boys, seeking that time should be divided equally between the parents.  The applications were consolidated and the case allocated to a s.9 circuit judge in North London and various directions given for hearing the applications.</span></p>

I told the Cafcass officer that he felt pressured by his upcoming exams for School A but did not expand on his views and seemed keen to avoid discussing it.  The only indication of I&#8217;s possible views obtained by the Cafcass officer was in a passing remark made by the mother, namely that, if I was not successful in his entrance exams and interview for School A, then her and I&#8217;s first choice of school was School B as I had shown a preference for this school when he attended for a visit.</span></p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8220;It is unfortunate that the parties require the assistance of the court to make a fundamental parenting choice.  The only issue that I noticed is that the mother may be entirely focussed on the children attending an Islamic school and there is a risk that she is failing to recognise the children&#8217;s multi-heritage and encouraging them to explore this.  The mother informed me that she would be able to afford the fees herself for I if he is successful at School A.  However, if he is not successful, she would agree for I to attend School B as a first choice.  It would be significant for both parties to be able to agree with this decision. However, in the light of I having had some involvement in the process at being at an age where he is able to express his views, it is important for his wishes and feelings to be considered and I would support I attending School B as a first option.&#8221;</span></p>

This means the children initially having one overnight stay during the school week with the parties agreeing to gradually increasing to around two nights per week.  I would hope the parties could come to an agreement before the next hearing, however, my view would be for I to attend School B which he showed a preference for and for Y to remain at his current primary school.&#8221;</span></p>

It is his core case however, that school represent neutral ground for the boys.  All schools in London will have Muslim children whose religious faith can be accommodated.

The judge, submits Mr.&#160;Samuel, had failed to appreciate the depth of the father&#8217;s views as they now are and how difficult it would be for the father to support him at school and also how difficult it would be for him to play an active role in I&#8217;s education, a point to which the judge earlier in his judgment had attached some importance.</span></p>

In essence, the judge found that the father had changed his mind about School A because he feared that, if I went there, he would be marginalised.  The judge&#8217;s conclusion, having heard the evidence, was that the father would not be marginalised if he took advantage of the extended contact time which he would be having under the order the judge was making.

Equality as between different communities, social groupings and creeds and equality as between men and women, boys and girls.  Secondly, we foster, encourage and facilitate aspiration, both aspiration as a virtue in itself and to the extent that it is practicable and reasonable to the child&#8217;s own aspirations.  Far too many lives in our community are blighted even today by lack of expiration.  Third, our objective must be to bring the child to adulthood in such a way the child is best equipped both to decide what kind of life they want to lead, what kind of person they want to be and to give effect as far as practicable to their aspirations.  Put shortly, our objective must be to maximise the child&#8217;s opportunities in every sphere of life as they enter adulthood.  And the corollary of this, where the decision has been devolved to a judicial parent, is that the judge must be cautious about approving a regime which may have the effect of foreclosing or unduly limiting the child&#8217;s ability to make such decisions in future.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">There is some disagreement between counsel as to whether the judge was actively referred to this passage but in my judgment, the important point is that there is no basis on which it can properly be said that his decision is inconsistent with the principles set out by the Court of Appeal.  I do not read anything in the words quoted above as indicating the Court of Appeal was of the view that religious schools in general, or Islamic schools in particular, were not to be preferred in all the circumstances if in accordance with the best interests of a child.</span></p>

I am entirely satisfied that this experienced judge was fully aware, at all times, of the paramountcy principle and that he had all the relevant factors in mind, notwithstanding that fact that he did not spell out, in terms, the factors in the s.1(3) welfare checklist.</span></p>

In my judgment, his conclusion the father would not be marginalised, is one that he was entitled to reach having heard the parents and considered all the evidence.</span></p>

That decision, that it should start in January 2018 as opposed to July 2017 as advocated by the father, was manifestly within the discretion of the judge and unappealable.</span></p>

I and his brother Y are lucky to have two parents who care so deeply about their welfare.  The boys have diverse backgrounds which contribute to their identity.  Although the judge&#8217;s decision about schooling must, in my judgment, stand for the reasons I have explained, the father&#8217;s role in their lives is absolutely crucial and the mother must do whatever she can to foster it.  I urge the parties to do everything possible to avoid returning to court on any issue in the future and try to resolve further disagreements without recourse to litigation, if at all possible.  </span></p>
