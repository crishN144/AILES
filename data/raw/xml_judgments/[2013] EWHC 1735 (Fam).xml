This requirement is prescribed by FPR 2010 rules 18.10 and 18.11.  The right to apply afforded to any affected party by those rules does not prescribe any minimum period of notice. Here an order was made which granted the husband the right to apply to set aside or vary the order but only on giving 48 hours notice. Nothing in the order or the note of the hearing explains why the husband&#8217;s rights under rules 18.10 and 18.11 were cut down.</span></p>

It is remarkable for this freezing order to have omitted every single standard safeguard and to have frozen, in addition to the Marbella property, other assets up to &#163;20m held in the husband&#8217;s sole name when the wife had positively deposed to a belief that he did not actually have any. </p>

However, entirely without prejudice (a) to that contention and (b) his claim that he in fact has no legal or beneficial interest in the Marbella property, and in a spirit of pragmatism, he offers an undertaking that he will take no steps to dispose of charge or otherwise deal with it, nor will he encourage the company that owns it to do so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In their careful written submissions for the husband at para 44 Miss Bangay QC and Mr Hagen argue that it is likely to be a solecism to refer to the general power of the High Court to grant a freezing order as arising only under the &#8220;inherent jurisdiction of the court&#8221;. Rather, they argue that the jurisdictional foundation arises under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref>. Although the power is undoubted, and the genesis of the power is therefore largely only of academic, as opposed to practical, significance, I am doubtful that it is strictly correct to suggest that the origins of the jurisdiction were solely statutory. There is however one important aspect to this issue to which I refer at para 14 below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An injunction is an equitable remedy which originally could only be granted by the Court of Chancery or the Court of Exchequer in equity. (The equity jurisdiction of the latter court was abolished by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/5/5" uk:canonical="1841 (5 Vict.) c. 5" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Court of Chancery Act 1841</ref>.) By section LXXXII of the Common Law Procedure Act 1854 the common law courts were given a wide jurisdiction, where it &#8220;shall seem reasonable and just&#8221;, to grant injunctions in cases of breach of contract and other like wrongs; so wide, in fact, that Baggalay LJ observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Quartz Hill Consolidated Gold Mining Company v Beall</span> (1882) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="20 Ch D 501" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">20 Ch D 501</ref> at 509 that the common law courts had a more extensive jurisdiction regarding the grant of injunctions than the Court of Chancery itself. Therefore, at that point, the power to grant injunctions was, so far as the Court of Chancery was concerned, both inherent and historic, while for the common law courts it was a brand new statutory power. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The 1870s saw the implementation of the great project to unite and consolidate the various separate courts and their separate systems of law into one Supreme Court of Judicature. The principal statute was the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873. As is well known by s24 law and equity were to be concurrently administered, and by s25(11) the rules of equity were to prevail where they were in conflict with the rules of common law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is certainly true that there has always existed a power to preserve in family proceedings the subject matter of the proceedings where they relate to tangible property as opposed to the chose in action that is money. That power is now reflected in FPR 2010 rule 20.1(c)(i) which empowers the court to make an order for the detention, custody or preservation of relevant property. (Such an order preserving a thing in specie can equally be made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37(2)</ref>(a) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.) But that power is generally used only to preserve things like chattels (it being usually unnecessary to invoke it in relation to land where the unilateral notice procedure under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/21" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 21" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Land Registration Act 1925</ref> is available).<span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000"/>For an illuminating discussion of this type of order and its  differences to a freezing order see <span style="font-style:italic">Re MCA; HM Customs and Excise Commissioners and Long v A and A; A v A (Long Intervening) </span>[2002] EWHC 611 (Admin/Fam), <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 2 FLR 274" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 2 FLR 274</ref>, paras 99-102 per Munby J (as he then was). Plainly this general power is not the subject of the principles and safeguards applicable to freezing orders. An order preserving a picture or a car or a field does not cause the economic paralysis that is the case where an order is made which freezes unspecified assets including money up to a certain figure. If a bank receives an order which freezes (as here) &#163;20m of assets then even if there are exceptions relating to living expenses, legal costs, and trading in the normal course of business, it will normally freeze all the accounts for the simple reason that it will not know if these exceptions are being met from another account with another bank. Where there are a number of banks it normally takes many days dealing with the various legal departments to put the exceptions into operation by which time great damage both economically, and reputationally, may have been caused. Problems of this kind just do not arise where the order merely freezes a particular tangible asset in specie. But it is open to the court to apply the principles and safeguards if the facts justify this.</p>

In my view the matrimonial field calls for a different approach. To my mind the circumstances here call for the injunction to continue. If it were discharged, the husband could well change his intentions, however genuine and well-disposed to the wife his present state of mind may be. Both he and the assets are out of the jurisdiction. Left without a job, and with new responsibilities, he will be faced with a temptation to eat into the whole of the fund.&#8221;</p>

The wife had left the parties&#8217; council flat with the children. The husband had obtained an order that prohibited the wife from excluding or attempting to exclude him from the flat. The wife gave notice to the council terminating the tenancy so that she could be granted a new one. The husband argued that it was ineffective as the wife was acting in breach of the order; that by bringing the proceedings when it was aware of the injunction the council had aided and abetted the wife in that breach and was itself in contempt of court; and that the proceedings were an abuse of the process of the court. The judge accepted this submission and dismissed the claim. The Court of Appeal dismissed the council&#8217;s appeal. The House of Lords allowed the council&#8217;s appeal and held that notice to terminate given by one joint tenant alone was sufficient to end the joint tenancy. The wife&#8217;s notice to the council was effective to allow the joint tenancy to terminate upon the expiration of the notice.</p>

Although the matter is in the end one for the discretion of the judge, <span style="font-style:italic">audi alterem partem</span> is a salutary and important principle. Their Lordships therefore consider that a judge should not entertain an application of which no notice has been given unless either giving notice would enable the defendant to take steps to defeat the purpose of the injunction (as in the case of a Mareva or Anton Piller order) or there has been literally no time to give notice before the injunction is required to prevent the threatened wrongful act. These two alternative conditions are reflected in rule 17.4(4) of the Civil Procedure Rules 2002. Their Lordships would expect cases in the latter category to be rare, because even in cases in which there was no time to give the period of notice required by the rules, there will usually be no reason why the applicant should not have given shorter notice or even made a telephone call. Any notice is better than none.&#8221;</p>

It is an absolutely elementary tenet of English law that save in an emergency a court should hear both sides before giving a ruling. The only recognised exception to this rule (apart from those instances where an ex parte procedure is specifically authorised by statute) is where there is a well founded belief that the giving of notice would lead to irretrievable prejudice being caused to the applicant for relief. I have the distinct impression that a sort of lazy, laissez-faire practice or syndrome has grown up which says that provided the return date is soon, and provided that the court is satisfied that no material prejudice will be caused to the respondent, then there is no harm in making the order ex parte. In my opinion this is absolutely wrong and turns principle on its head."</p>

To reduce the risk of abuse, stringent safeguards have been put in place to protect, as far as possible, the interests of the absent respondent. It is worth remembering what some of those safeguards are. First, an order will not be made unless the applicant produces evidence which shows that he has a very strong case. Second, the evidence must be served on the respondent with the order. Third, the order always includes a cross-undertaking in damages. Fourth, the order includes an express right to the respondent to apply to discharge on short notice. Fifth, the order must included a return date so that the issue can be brought back for review inter partes as soon as possible. Sixth, in Mareva orders there is an explicit provision allowing the respondent access to sufficient of his funds to pay his reasonable legal expenses&#8212;a provision which ensures that he has the financial resources available to fight for the discharge or modification of the order. All of these are intended to offer some, albeit imperfect, protection to the respondent.</p>

The responsibility for putting in place, in an ex parte order, sufficient safeguards for the absent respondent lies predominantly with the applicant. Here the Bank has not discharged that responsibility. Miss Andrews says that the order should be looked at as an interpleader rather than a freezing order, but it does not matter what the order is called. It is draconian and designed to prevent the defendants from accessing their own property. It appears to me that no regard was paid at all to the interests of the defendants nor to the possibility&#8212;which is now conceded to be the fact&#8212;that the defendants might not be shown to have done anything wrong.

Having regard to Munby J&#8217;s reasoning I am of the opinion that when the court considers requiring an undertaking in favour of a third party under para 5.2 it should almost invariably conclude that it should so require. </span></p>

These have been considered by the President who has authorised me to promulgate them for general use.

The example for the freezing order should be used whether the application is made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1981 Act</ref> to a High Court Judge or to a District Judge under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>. It will be seen that each example order requires that the reason for giving no, or short, notice is expressly stated on its face.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I draw attention to the great concern of myself and other judges at the  continued widespread abuse of the principles governing ex parte applications not only for freezing orders but also more generally. It is worth remembering not only that the ex parte procedure is intrinsically unfair but also, and very importantly, that a case which begins with an ex parte order is usually poisoned from that point onwards. The unilateral step taken at the beginning of case echoes down its history. Often the respondent is enraged by the step taken against him and looks to take counter-offensive measures. Every single subsequent step is coloured by that fateful first step. Costs tend to mount exponentially. And even after the lawyers close their files and render their final bills the personal relations of the spouses will likely remain forever soured. A nuclear winter often ensues. This is not to say that sometimes, but very rarely, an ex parte application is necessary. Insistence on the imposition of the stringent conditions and detailed safeguards might have the side-effect of mitigating the unhappy consequences to which I have referred.

But if the wife elects to go down this route she is bound in that affidavit candidly to reveal that her knowledge derives from illegitimately obtained documents, and must explain how she got them. She must do this even if this leads to a civil suit or criminal proceedings. That is the price that she will (potentially) have to pay for making an application based on illegitimately obtained knowledge.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I have accessed the safe the claimant refers to on one occasion. Until a certain point, I estimate around 3 to 5 years ago, the claimant and I shared the safe in the hallway between the claimant's bedroom and office.  I kept my jewellery in it. The safe could be accessed in two ways, by a code (which I did not know), and by a key which the claimant retained. This was increasingly problematic for me as each time I wanted to wear an item of jewellery I had to liaise with the claimant so that the safe could be opened. Consequently I asked the claimant to install a further safe for my personal use. After this date he alone used the joint safe. Although I cannot remember precisely, I believe that on the occasion the claimant has referred to, my personal safe had not yet been installed. I cannot remember the precise date I accessed the safe, but suspect that it was around 2009. ... On the occasion in question, the claimant was out playing golf. He always kept the key to the safe in his bag. I went into the office, removed the key and opened the safe. The only items within it of my husband's were various bills for the Marbella property. At the time the claimant and my relationship was difficult. Given his secrecy about financial issues I wished to obtain as much information as possible as I suspected that we would divorce at some stage.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife's defaults here were not confined to a breach of the duty of candour, as I have explained. Weighing up all of her conduct I have no hesitation in concluding that she has forfeited the right to the exercise of the court's discretion to re-grant an injunction. Further, I do not accept the arguments that the husband's presentation supplies the evidence of a present unjustified dealing by him with his assets giving rise to a risk of dissipation to the wife's prejudice. After all, all the arrangements mentioned in the husband's affidavit were done long ago as part of his desire to keep his business and other activities as secret as possible. I have no doubts that the wife has at all times been well aware of this.</p>

Had he not done so I would not have imposed a freezing/preservation order over the Marbella property, given the wife&#8217;s misconduct. However, it is important that I recognise that the unparticularised evidence of the husband&#8217;s threats, coupled with the turbidity of his financial arrangements, do give rise to suspicions and cause for concern. The husband should not have the slightest doubt that the highly pertinent questions raised in Mr Marshall QC&#8217;s skeleton argument will all need to be investigated in depth by the questionnaire process. Had the wife given a fully explained account of the circumstances and context of the threats; fulfilled her duty of candour; and complied with the applicable principles and safeguards, it is distinctly possible that a freezing/preservation order over (at least) the Marbella property would have been justified.   </p>

The matter came before Slade J on 15 May 2013, the day before the hearing before me.

Continuity of judicial involvement is desirable both for efficiency and for consistency of decision-making.

On the facts of this case I agree with that decision. A claim for breach of confidence and misuse of private information arguably raises &#8220;technical issues, outside the familiar family law territory&#8221;. There is a respectable argument that even though there is only one High Court in which all general jurisdiction is vested in all of its judges (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/4/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 4(3)</ref>, 5(5) and 19(4) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re Hastings (No. 3) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1959] Ch 368" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1959">[1959] Ch 368</ref>, per Vaisey J at 377-378), a technical claim such as this should be first heard by a specialist judge <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">provided that the main dispute between the spouses is not delayed</span>. I was told by Miss Bangay QC that the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division can offer a three-day fixture in eight months time (i.e. by January 2014). Given that the First Appointment in this case will not be heard until 4 September 2013 it is improbable that the FDR could be heard before January 2014. The Queen&#8217;s Bench hearing will therefore not, in this case, likely cause any material delay to these proceedings.</p>
