H (who was then an insolvency practitioner) was made bankrupt on his own petition on the 6 October 2011. The bankruptcy may, or may not, have been tactical: H says that it was the direct result of W&#8217;s claim for ancillary relief.  For the management of the issue which has arisen it does not matter and I express no view. A substantial claimant in the bankruptcy is S (H&#8217;s son by an earlier marriage). </p>

Until recently the registered proprietor of No.68 was W: in November 2003 she had executed a declaration of trust under which H was declared to be the absolute beneficial owner. The value of No.68 at the date of the bankruptcy order is, for the purposes of argument, taken at approximately &#163;1.8m.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reason why No.68 is the only asset in the bankruptcy estate is because of the collapse of H&#8217;s insolvency practice. That practice was conducted through a company (&#8220;RMC1&#8221;). On the 16 January 2012 RMC1&#8217;s bankers appointed administrators, because H&#8217;s bankruptcy put in jeopardy his insolvency practitioner&#8217;s and accountant&#8217;s licences on which the businesses depended. RMC1 had filed accounts at Companies House, but had withdrawn them at the insistence of HMRC. This meant there were only unaudited accounts. The unaudited accounts for the year ending 30 April 2010 had shown that RMC1 had net assets of &#163;1.14m. That net figure would have been reached after allowing for the repayment to H of his director&#8217;s loan account (which stood at &#163;200,000.00 or more). H was the sole shareholder of RMC1 (and so was entitled to the value of the net assets). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Most unfortunately in June 2011 (the month in which W&#8217;s petition was served) there was (according to H) a software accident in Pakistan which led to the destruction of RMC1&#8217;s primary records. Not only that, but the administrators have been unable to obtain RMC1&#8217;s management accounts (or secondary records). This means that the administrators do not know who owes money to RMC1, and so they are unable to collect the book debts or value the work in progress. This means that H will not receive any distribution in respect of his substantial director&#8217;s loan account, and that the value of his interest in the business (which stood at &#163;1.6 million on the last accounts) has evaporated. Of course, someone with personal knowledge of the business of RMC1 might well know who owed it money: but the administrators are not in that position. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to liabilities in the bankruptcy the following are worthy of note. First, the difficulties faced in the administration of RMC1 and the fact of H&#8217;s bankruptcy meant that the bankers called upon personal guarantees and called in loans. Fortunately for H, S has paid off these banks and taken over the debts: so that in the bankruptcy the votes which would have been exercised by banks with purely commercial considerations in mind are now being exercised by his son who is able to take into account his father&#8217;s family interests. Second, S has done the same in relation to debts claimed by H&#8217;s friends to be owing to them, payment being said to be made in Pakistan (totalling &#163;70,000). Third, as I shall have to explain, there is a debt owed to Barclays Wealth in Jersey in the sum of about &#163;425,000.00: this was secured on a property at Charles Lane which is beneficially owned by S. S has also discharged this debt (and accordingly in the bankruptcy again casts the votes attached to it). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fourth, in his Statement of Affairs dated 5 October 2011 H says that he is indebted to a business associate (&#8220;Declan&#8221;) in the sum of &#163;500,000.00 (inclusive of approximately &#163;100,000.00 in interest). This is as a result of advance commission received in 2004 and 2005 in respect of a &#8220;commercial deal that did not complete&#8221; so that the commission became returnable. In the Family Division proceedings by his Form E dated 16 August 2011 H had estimated this debt at &#163;750,000.00 and had said:-</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In 2004/5 I assisted [Declan]&#8230; in an investment project in Ireland. As a result of the deal, I was due a commission of &#8364;600,000.00. As I wanted the cash upfront, partly for investments in Lahore, I asked [Declan] if he would loan it to me as an advance on my commission and he agreed to do so. Unfortunately, the property market in Ireland collapsed and the commission was no longer due to me, and [Declan] has therefore demanded repayment of his loan. At the point the deal failed, we agreed that I would pay interest at the Dublin Central Bank rate plus 7% as I was unable to repay the loan. [Declan] originally indicated that he would accept repayment in sterling, but given the dramatic movement in the exchange rate he is now insisting on repayment in Euros&#8230;&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H&#8217;s bankruptcy obviously impinged on W&#8217;s financial claims in the Family Division Proceedings. First, unless there is a clear surplus of assets over liabilities in the bankruptcy it will not be possible for an award to be made in her favour in the ancillary relief proceedings: see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hellyer v Hellyer</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 2 FLR 579" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 2 FLR 579</ref>. </p>

That application was obviously made in the bankruptcy proceedings. The regulation of proceedings in bankruptcy is a matter for the registrars and judges of the Chancery Division. But as Patten LJ pointed out in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Arif v Anwar</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/986" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 986" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 986</ref> at paragraph 21:-</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;That said, judges and registrars sitting in bankruptcy need to be alive to the real possibility that husbands (or wives) may attempt to use the protection of a bankruptcy order as a shield against the claims of their spouses for ancillary relief. Where there is credible evidence of this, they should not be afraid to use the powers which they have to order full disclosure and to require the attendance and cross examination of witnesses where this is necessary in order properly and fairly to determine the annulment application. In such cases the more convenient course may well be to transfer the annulment application itself to be heard along side the ancillary relief application in the Family Division, where the evidence and issues are likely to be similar and costs can be saved by having a single hearing of both applications&#8221;. </p>

	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">W&#8217;s attempt to achieve that end did not succeed in the instant case because the Registrar made a proper case management order for the determination of the annulment application to remain in the Chancery Division. W abandoned the application; so the bankruptcy proceedings continued.

The Trustees will need to obtain possession of No.68, and that will entail an examination of the extent of S&#8217;s interest in No.68. The Trustees will also have to admit debts to proof, and this will involve an examination of the claims of S and of Declan. The nature of the assets in the estate means that there are no ready monies out of which the costs of any detailed investigation or litigation could be paid: so the Trustees have not settled upon the commencement of proceedings. The creditors cannot be looked to as a source of funding any proceedings, since the principal creditors are S and Declan, whose dealings would fall for examination. Any funding arrangement requiring approval from the creditors would face the difficulty that the votes attaching to the principal debts are now exercisable by S. </p>

This was in essence an application that W&#8217;s claim for ancillary relief in its entirety should be adjourned generally. The ground of the submission was that Eleanor King J had proceeded on the footing that even after the deduction of very substantial matrimonial costs W&#8217;s most basic needs (namely housing for herself and for the child of her marriage to H) could be met albeit at a modest level: but that matters had moved on and it could now be demonstrated that in no circumstances would there ever be any surplus in the bankruptcy estate.

So far as S was concerned, it was said that it was procedurally unfair that his third party interest (in No. 68 or in transactions with H which W labelled &#8220;shams&#8221;) should be determined in the absence of the Trustees in bankruptcy and without any properly pleaded case. I rejected those submissions. I reminded myself that the process on which I was embarked was a form of &#8220;oral disclosure&#8221;, and that whilst Coleridge J had suggested that the outcome of the process might be &#8220;preliminary indications or even findings&#8221;, that could only be the result if a judge, who was astute to ensure that the right to a fair hearing was not jeopardised, considered it procedurally fair.

H is joined, not because he has any subsisting property interest in No.68 (for his interest is vested in the Trustees); but because the outcome of the determination may affect any order that might be made against him in the ancillary relief proceedings, since he is (or will be) discharged from bankruptcy.</p>

Unless the Court is (a) to order an inquiry into every dealing between H and S; and then  (b) in the light of the outcome of that enquiry direct W to identify which of those transactions constitutes a sham; and then (c) adjudicate upon each such transaction, this is not a case that is fairly justiciable.

How the purchase was actually financed and how any borrowing was repaid is not at present known because most unfortunately all of the relevant records were thrown away following a burst pipe incident at No.68. So only sketchy details are available. They derive from some solicitor&#8217;s correspondence containing instructions from H: but at the hearing H said these were only instructions and were not necessarily carried into effect. But it reliably appears that Tema House was bought for &#163;545,000, funded as to &#163;390,000 (or perhaps &#163;387,500) by a mortgage from Barclays (formerly Woolwich) and &#163;155,000 sourced from the &#163;600,000 advance from Barclays Wealth to which I have referred.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the case of H and S that between the end of 2003 and 29 May 2009 all of this money was repaid by S to H. How and when this repayment was achieved cannot be detailed because, as I have explained, most unfortunately the relevant documents have been destroyed. In the alternative it was said that insofar as records have survived they have all been handed over to the trustee in bankruptcy (and neither H nor S has access to them). S explained in the course of his evidence on oral disclosure that (despite the clear terms of Eleanor King J.&#8217;s order) he had not really delved into how all the money borrowed to fund the properties he owned had been repaid. His focus had been post May 2009. It is for S to show that he is no longer liable to indemnify his trustees: if the documents he produces do not demonstrate this, then he must plead a case and prove it by other evidence. Bare evidence of payment (e.g. entries on bank statements) will not avail unless the source of the funds in the account can be demonstrated. H and S say that the ultimate source of the repayments is the accumulated rental income from Charles Lane. But the available documents and the result of oral disclosure suggest that this cannot really be so. Just standing back and looking at the broad picture it is not at all easy to see how S came to repay &#163;980,000 (in respect of the Mortgage Liabilities) and invest &#163;500,000 in No. 68 and lend &#163;425,000 to H after May 2009 when his disclosed net income from Charles Lane for over a decade amounts to just over &#163;50,000, when for a significant part of that time he was a student, and when he obviously indulged himself to the full in the purchase of expensive cars (one apparently costing &#163;175,000). But on disclosure his tax returns may well demonstrate earnings and capital gains sufficient to cover such expenditure.</p>

H and S say that the Barclays Wealth account ceased to be overdrawn in May 2009 and that from and after 29 May 2009 H was a net debtor to S. S says that his lending to H is equal to the sum standing overdrawn on the Barclays Wealth account at the date of the bankruptcy in the sum of &#163;425,000: H says that of this balance about &#163;87,000 represents drawings by S (in connection with car purchases) so that the true sum H owes is &#163;339,000.  Whether there is any such balance due from H (and if so, whether there is any outstanding liability upon S to indemnify H in respect of other borrowing) obviously affects the amount for which S may prove in the bankruptcy and so the possibility of any surplus.</p>

I give no indication that his debt is provable in H&#8217;s bankruptcy. That is a matter for the Trustees: and on the material produced at the hearing (and the answers given by Declan) they may well have issues to examine before admitting the debt to proof in full. The relationship between Declan and his Group on the one hand and H and RMC1 on the other was plainly not simply that of client and accountant/financial adviser, and having regard to the context of those dealings and to the context of the payment of the sums said to constitute the debt (a possible over-provision for Irish capital gains tax that Declan thought his accountant might as well have) there may be inquiries which the Trustees might want to make. But that does seem to me pre-eminently a matter for them; and that there is no reason to bring debt questions into the Family Division. Family relationships undoubtedly influenced the dealings of H and S. But the oral disclosure hearing was helpful in demonstrating that family relationships did not appear to influence the commercial dealings of H and Declan. It did not strike me as likely (though it may prove to be so on enquiry) that the existing commercial relationships between Declan and H were collusively re-characterised so as to cause the maximum disadvantage to W.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, I do not consider it right to conduct in the Family Division an inquiry into whether S has collected monies due to RMC1.  In March 2011 &#8220;Rescue my company&#8221; (&#8220;RMC2&#8221;) began to trade: it was funded, staffed, serviced and accommodated by RMC1 and seems to have looked after some of the clients of RMC1. It collected some fees that were due to RMC1: H said, I thought surprisingly, that it made no difference since he was the shareholder and director of both companies. S became a director of RMC2 shortly before RMC1 went into administration. After the commencement of the administration of RMC1 money that appeared to be due to RMC1 or RMC2 was paid directly into S&#8217;s bank account. &#163;163,000-worth of such potential payments were identified. S said that appearances were deceptive. The money was due to RMC2 (not RMC1). It had been paid to him because by two unrecorded agreements RMC2 had agreed to buy furniture, computers and network routers that former tenants had left at Charles Lane (and which S claimed personally), and that rather than pay for these directly RMC2 had asked some clients to pay S (rather than RMC2). None of this seems to me to have anything to do with what debts are provable in H&#8217;s estate in bankruptcy (and so whether there is a surplus available for W). It might go to the credit of S: but disclosure going to credit is a wholly exceptional thing to order or pursue. I will leave that matter to the administrators or liquidator of RMC2.</p>

A representative of the Trustees attended the hearing before me: and the Trustees will have formed a view from the oral disclosure process what they may accept at face value and what may warrant further enquiry.</p>

That is because the only claim acknowledged by H and advanced by S is to 50% of No.68 arising from an agreement  between H and S that he should invest &#163;500,000 (which it is said he did by the end of 2007). It is now said that S might wish to advance some estoppel claim or unjust enrichment claim (neither foreshadowed in evidence or argument) and that this post-2007 expenditure might be relevant to the establishment of an interest and its quantification. If such a case is to be advanced it would obviously need to be formulated before it could be considered and made the subject of case management directions. Eleanor King J&#8217;s order was quite clear as to what was required of S. I see no reason to delay handing down judgement on this account.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Third, a question is raised as to why S is the Claimant in the Dealings Issue, and it is said that S&#8217;s case is that his monies were improperly used. I hope my reasoning is clear. The evidence shows that part of the loan advances raised (in respect of which H and W are entitled to be indemnified by their beneficiary S) were applied for S&#8217;s benefit. S says he actually repaid all money so applied so that the outstanding indebtedness is that of the trustees themselves. The Dealings Issue requires him to lead evidence of when the repayments occurred. There is a separate breach of trust issue (which S has advanced in correspondence in general terms): this relates to the period after 2009. If he wishes to advance a claim for breach of trust he would naturally be the claimant in that issue. I see no reason to revise my view or to delay hand-down on this account.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fourth, S wants to advance his breach of trust claim. So be it. That can be done by commencing proceedings in the Chancery Division to establish liability, or by submitting some claim in the bankruptcy. But S has taken no such steps. My identification of preliminary issues in the ancillary relief proceedings does not inhibit him from taking either course.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fifth, time estimates. S joins with the Trustees in suggesting that the time estimates for the hearings I have set out above may be insufficient. I can well see that the identified issues may together take a total of 4 days. The order should so provide. I was and am concerned that this litigation should not balloon. What is at its heart (and may be lost sight of) is whether modest provision can be made for the basic needs of W and the child of the marriage (S&#8217;s stepmother and half-brother) who had until the divorce lived in a house worth &#163;1.8 million and enjoyed a high standard of living. Extensive and expensive litigation will absorb funds that could go a long way to making that provision. </p>
