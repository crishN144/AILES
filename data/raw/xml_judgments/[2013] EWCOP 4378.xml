      <p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-weight:bold">NOTE BY MR JUSTICE MOSTYN (4 December 2013)</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Although no-one has sought to appeal the judgment dated 23 August 2012 during the last 15 months, or to have it transcribed for any other purpose, I have decided to authorise its release together with the verbatim transcript of the proceedings and the order made so as to inform and clarify recent public comments about this case. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">It will be seen that the application to me was not made by the local authority or social workers. Rather, it was an urgent application first made at 16:16 on 23 August 2012 by the NHS Trust, supported by the clear evidence of a consultant obstetrician and the patient&#8217;s own treating consultant psychiatrist, seeking a declaration and order that it would be in the medical best interests of this seriously mentally ill and incapacitated patient, who had undergone two previous elective caesarean sections, to have this birth, the due date of which was imminent (she was 39 weeks pregnant), in the same manner. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The patient was represented by the Official Solicitor who instructed a Queen&#8217;s Counsel on her behalf. He did not seek an adjournment and did not oppose the application, agreeing that the proposed delivery by caesarean section was in the best interests of the patient herself who risked uterine rupture with a natural vaginal birth. I agreed that the medical evidence was clear and, applying binding authority from the Court of Appeal concerning cases of this nature, as well as the express terms of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, made the orders and declarations that were sought.  </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Although I emphasised that the Court of Protection had no jurisdiction over the unborn baby, I offered advice to the local authority (which were not a party to or represented in the proceedings, or present at the hearing) that it would be heavy-handed to invite the police to take the baby following the birth using powers under section 46 of the Children Act 1989. Instead, following the birth there should be an application for an interim care order at the hearing of which the incapacitated mother could be represented by her litigation friend, the Official Solicitor. </p>

I remind myself that harsh though it is, the interests of this unborn child are not the concern of this court as the child has no legal existence until he or she is born, other than in respect of tortious acts committed on him or her. So the decision must be made squarely within the four corners of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.  </span></p>

It is explained in the two reports of the treating consultant psychiatrist, Dr Adimulam, both dated in August 2012, that say she suffers from psychotic episodes and delusional beliefs.   Although, as Mr Lock QC has explained to me, the fact of detention under section 3 of the Mental Health Act does not ineluctably mean that she lacks capacity within the terms of Section 2 of the Mental Capacity Act, there is evidence here that demonstrates that this is the case.  It is accepted by Mr Lock QC, whom I have appointed to represent her as her litigation friend, that she does lack capacity within the terms of section 2(1) of the Mental Capacity Act.</span></p>

Under section 1(5) I must make a decision that is in her best interests and in so doing I must have regard to the principle of least restriction.

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">  The problem here is that as the mother has had two children by caesarean section before, it is the clear obstetric advice of Mr Spencer, in accordance with the guidance given by the Royal College of Gynaecology, and specifically in this case, that she should have an elective planned caesarean in order to avoid not only risks for the child, but to herself, of a ruptured womb.  There is a significant risk of a ruptured womb, perhaps as much as 1%, were she to have a natural vaginal delivery.  So the medical evidence from the obstetrician is clear that it is in her best interests that she should have the procedure in the way I described, which is by a planned or elective caesarean tomorrow.  That is supported by the psychiatric evidence, which is that it is also in her interests, thereby mirroring what is said by Lady Justice Butler-Sloss in the decision of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re MB</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> at page 439.  So it is demonstrably in her best interests that it should be this way.  </span></p>

I think, looked at from her point of view, there is also a significant mental health advantage in her unborn child not being exposed to risk during his or her birth.    In those circumstances it seems - and I hope very much that restraint will not be necessary - that the procedure that is proposed is manifestly in her interests.  </span></p>

I expressed the view, which I require to be incorporated in the order, and to be communicated to the local authority, that I think on the basis of what has been said to me that would be heavy-handed and might cause significant deterioration in the mother&#8217;s mental health in circumstances where I am required to consider her best interests.  It would be better, I would have thought, for application to be made on notice to the Official Solicitor to me tomorrow (my being the applications judge) for an interim care order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  On that occasion the mother would be represented by the Official Solicitor and debate would take place as to whether the child&#8217;s welfare demanded his or her removal and if so when and on what terms.  Miss Burnham has accepted that this advice of mine should be incorporated into the order and relayed to the local authority.  So that advice will appear as a preamble.</span></p>

My Lord, again Dr. Spencer has provided a very short witness statement which is not before you at the moment simply because it was not able to be signed.  I understand he annotated his witness statement but did not change very much the substance of it.  I shall just ask my instructing solicitor to hand that up to you. My Lord, again I apologise for the state of the evidence. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  That is all right.  Do not worry.  So while you are looking for that - I will come to you in a minute, but I am just staring in your direction in a vacant way - but while you are looking for that, the order you are seeking is presumably a declaration that it is in her best interest to have the caesarean.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MISS BURNHAM:  My Lord, yes.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MISS BURNHAM:  And indeed it is to do with the general anaesthetic rather than the spinal anaesthetic, but I believe, my Lord, there are other issues, tangential issues perhaps, which the Official Solicitor would want to address you on. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  I will come to those in a minute.  Would you like to hand that up to me then? </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MISS BURNHAM:  My Lord, yes.  My Lord, the Official Solicitor has not as yet seen that statement, so if it were possible to be passed back down when your Lordship has read it ----</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  I will just read it first.  (Pause)  Could you pass that to Mr. Lock, please.  What mental illness is she suffering from? </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MISS BURNHAM:  My Lord, it is said that she suffers from a schizophrenic disorder, which is psychotic in nature and she is currently under section 3.  My Lord, that is as detailed as the identification of the disorder goes.  It is in the report of Dr. Adimulam, which is at your clip 4.   It is the second document entitled &#8220;private and confidential&#8221;. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  Just a second.  Were the previous two children put in permanent care? </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MISS BURNHAM: My Lord, that is as I understand the position.  My Lord, there is a suggestion in the documents that they are currently with the grandmother. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  One second.   So there is psychiatric evidence here that the caesarean is in her best interest, from her mental health point of view.  So we have obstetric and psychiatric evidence that this will be in this patient&#8217;s best interests. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MISS BURNHAM:  My Lord, yes.  May I just update you?  I managed to speak to Dr. Spencer myself before we came in and one of the issues that Dr. Spencer raised in relation to the C-Section was, he said, that there was another option of, for example, allowing her to go into spontaneous labour and doing the emergency C-Section if certain risks materialised.  However, what he said was the crucial issue that caused him to exercise his clinical judgment in favour of a planned caesarean was the fact that because of her mental state, if she were dissembling or otherwise being uncooperative, they would not be able to monitor the baby&#8217;s heartbeat, for example, to see whether there were the potential uterine rupture complications emerging - and that is what clinched it for him, as he explained it to me. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  Although I am not allowed to consider the interests of the unborn child, it must be in the mother&#8217;s interest to have a healthy baby. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MISS BURNHAM:  My Lord, I was rather surprised, on reading </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re MB</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, to see how strongly that passage put it about the rights of the unborn - if you like the separate between the rights of the unborn child and the mother in those circumstances.   My Lord, I do not propose to address you at any great length in relation to that.  It may be something that the Official Solicitor can address you on. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  That is fine.  We have unambiguous psychiatric evidence from Dr. Adimulam.  Then I had the evidence from the obstetrician that it is clearly in her medical interests for her to have a caesarean.  The point about &#8220;let us just see if we need one as we go along and allow her to go into normal labour&#8221; is that I am not sure that that would necessarily obviate the risk of uterine rupture.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MISS BURNHAM:  No, it would not. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  That is quite high.  It is nearly 1%. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MISS BURNHAM:  It is 1%.  He says the real problem is the inability to monitor even that risk because of her mental ----</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MISS BURNHAM:  He says also that there is a possibility that she might be dissembling and not telling when she is going into labour, for example.  As you will have seen from the papers, my Lord, there is a suggestion that one of her anxieties is the removal. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Mr. Lock, are you equipped to represent the interests of this lady? </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. LOCK:  My Lord, we invite your Lordship to appoint the Official Solicitor to represent her. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  I do. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. LOCK:  We accept the appointment, if the court will do so. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  I do that. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. LOCK:  Thank you. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  Who represents her in the mental health proceedings, as a matter of interest?  Some advocate, I expect.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. LOCK:  My Lord, I am sure a very responsible and experienced mental health solicitor, but I am not able to assist your Lordship.  We invite your Lordship to approach it in this way.  First of all the question is:  does she have capacity?  She plainly does not, because there is evidence of delusional beliefs.  We have thought carefully as to whether we ought to ask your Lordship to adjourn this so that we can get further into capacity, but given that this is the treating psychiatrist and she has been in his care since at least June of this year, there appears to be evidence, therefore, based on a fair amount of background information;  not like a psychiatrist who has seen a patient on one occasion and just gives a view where there is always a concern that there may be some background that the psychiatrist was not fully aware of.  This appears to be a reasoned report based on a good knowledge of the patient.  Therefore we do not propose to ask your Lordship to adjourn. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  No, I agree with that.  I am struggling to envisage a circumstance where a patient detained under section 3 as an inpatient with a diagnosed mental illness has got capacity.  It is possible, but I am struggling to imagine how it could happen. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. LOCK:  Oh it could happen very easily. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  Could it? </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. LOCK:  Yes, because if the mental health condition has been properly managed by drugs to a point where the patient is ----</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  On the point of being discharged, say.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. LOCK:  Well, even not on the point of being discharged, but is managing well.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  Okay.  I take that point, but Dr. Adimulam is not describing her thus. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. LOCK:  No, he is not. So, my Lord, for capacity there is a tick in the box.  Best interests:  my Lord, the one thing we were concerned about was the relationship between section 1(5) and section 1(6) of the Mental Capacity Act, because there is an argument to say the least restrictive option here would be to allow her to give birth naturally, if she was minded to do so and wanted to oppose the imposition of a caesarean, and that therefore if a decision has to be made, the way that is least restrictive of her rights and freedoms would be to proceed along the path of allowing a natural birth and then ----</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  Subsection (6) is subject to subsection (5).  It is just that I must have regard to that. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. LOCK:  Precisely. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  But under (5) I must make it in the best interests. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. LOCK:  That is exactly the point. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOSTYN:  The Code of Practice says the final decision must be based entirely on what is in the person&#8217;s best interests. </span></p>

	  <heading style="margin-left:0.4in;text-indent:-0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. LOCK:  My Lord, that is the point I was going to come on to. In fact, what is in her best interests may not be the least restrictive because in this case it appears to us that the psychiatric evidence on page 2 of Dr. Adimulam and the evidence of the obstetrician is that it is in her best interests, if she is going to have a caesarean, for it to be in a planned way with the right amount of staff to support her and the right structure, rather than being done at a time that nobody could predict (some time over the next two or three weeks) when you have absolutely no idea whether you are going to have the right staff or not, and whether it is going to be safe or not.  So, my Lord, to that extent, even though it is not at first blush the most restrictive option, it would appear, on the evidence, to be the option that is in her best interests. </span></heading>
