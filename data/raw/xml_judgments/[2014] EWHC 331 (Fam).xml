Even then, he was concerned about the effect of delay.

There was no dispute as to this although the matters raised were against the Mother not the Father.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none">The judge ruled out both the Father and the Paternal Grandmother as long-term carers for N.  He rejected long term fostering as being unsuitable in this case.  He said that, whilst special guardianship would be a possible solution, it had disadvantages.  For example, it expires at age 18 and would provide less permanency for N than adoption.  He had previously quoted in detail from the evidence of the Independent Social Worker, Anna Boyle as to the need for permanency and stability for N.  He considered adoption would be the best solution, whilst recognising that it was a huge interference with the right to family life of N and her father and grandmother.  He said a greater interference was hard to imagine but added that, for the reasons he had given, he considered it both justified and proportionate and in pursuance of a legitimate aim, namely the welfare of N.  He was unable to make a placement order as the matter had not been to the Adoption Panel and there was no application before him. He rejected an application for further assessments.  He again referred to the very considerable delay and that the proceedings had been very drawn out.  The judgment is a long and detailed judgment, running to over thirty pages, by a very experienced judge.   </p>

On 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2012, Ward LJ refused the Paternal Grandmother permission to appeal following an oral hearing.  The focus seems to have been the refusal of further assessments rather than the substantive decision.  He again stressed that delay was an important element in the case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none">The matter came back before HHJ Atkins shortly thereafter. His judgment is dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2012.  He incorporated his previous judgment into this judgment but this judgment is itself not short, comprising some eleven pages.  It is clear, however, that he concentrated on the matters that were substantively in issue before him, namely whether or not N could live with the Father and Paternal Grandmother or whether she should be adopted.  It remained the case of the Father and Paternal Grandmother that N should live with them, even though they had been ruled out in the previous judgment. It is not until Paragraph 168 of Mr Macdonald&#8217;s Written Submission on their behalf that a special guardianship order is mentioned.  HHJ Atkins made a final care order and a placement order.  Parental consent was dispensed with.  The Local Authority was authorised to place for adoption, although I make it quite clear that this was to be with the existing foster carers. These carers were fully committed to direct parental contact after adoption.  The judge therefore declined to make a contact order.  In his judgment, he found that the benefits of adoption outweighed the disadvantages and that it was clearly in N&#8217;s best interests, given the importance of her medical condition and her welfare throughout her life.   </p>

The application was renewed orally by leading counsel before McFarlane LJ on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2012.  For the first time, the issue of special guardianship featured substantively.  McFarlane LJ gave permission to appeal on the basis that he was concerned that the distinction between special guardianship and adoption should have been uppermost in the mind of the court. </p>

The appeal was dismissed.  Thorpe LJ gave an extempore judgment.  He said that there was no dispute that the foster carers would be N&#8217;s long term carers.  He then concentrated on the fact that special guardianship had not been actively argued before HHJ Atkins. He concluded that, as a result, it could not be said that the judge was wrong not to deal with it.  The other two judges agreed.   They refused leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.   </p>

Third, the party seeking a stay should provide cogent evidence that the appeal will be stifled or rendered nugatory unless a stay is granted.  Fourth, in exercising its discretion, the court applies what is in effect a balance of harm test in which the likely prejudice to the successful party must be carefully considered.

The key question is whether the parent&#8217;s prospects of success are more than just fanciful but whether they have solidity.  In doing so, the judge has to remember that the child&#8217;s welfare is paramount and must be considered throughout her life.  In evaluating welfare, the judge will bear in mind what has happened in the past, the current state of affairs and what will or may happen in the future.

There was a genuine mistake made by a social worker and there was an offer to make up the lost contact.  The argument was modified by Mr Macdonald in submissions to be based on the fact that the Applicants had previously supported twelve periods of contact between N and her Father after adoption but were now saying there should be only four.  This has just as little merit.  The Judge had considered this in detail in his judgment and had preferred the Local Authority position which was for four periods of contact, rather than that of the Guardian (or even the Applicants) for more.  He approved the Care Plan which provided for four contact visits, so there has been absolutely no change in circumstances.</p>

It seems pretty clear that this will, in due course, be extended so as to enable her to become a British Citizen.  Again, this is most certainly not a change of circumstances.  The expert evidence before Judge Atkins considered this was the likely outcome, even if the reason seems to have been different to that postulated at the time.  Moreover, the case against adoption was in part based on the possibility of the Father and Paternal Grandmother being removed from this country if the placement order was made.  Although this argument was firmly rejected by the Judge, it is impossible to see how the favourable resolution of the Grandmother&#8217;s position can assist the Father in alleging a change of circumstances.

I do not want them to suffer undue distress, which I accept could itself have a detrimental effect on N.  In this regard, however, I am reassured by the evidence that was before HHJ Atkins.  They were asked in writing as to their views and they said that their priority was to provide consistency and stability for N and that the type of order made by the court was, for them, less important than this.  I recognise that they now seek an adoption order but it is not a case where N was placed with them solely on the basis of a placement order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none">To reassure them further, I make it quite clear that there is no question whatsoever of N being removed from their care.  The Father&#8217;s appeal against the final care order has been dismissed and he can have absolutely no complaint about that.  He has been excluded as a carer and that will remain the position.  The issue is solely between special guardianship and adoption.  I make it equally clear that, by giving leave to oppose, I am not indicating that I favour special guardianship over adoption.  I will decide on the evidence.  I am merely saying that the Father is, on the authorities, entitled to have the matter heard and properly determined.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;border:none">I therefore give the Father leave to oppose the adoption application.  As I indicated at the beginning of this judgment, I am very troubled by the immense delay that has taken place in this case.  I will hear the case with a two day time estimate commencing on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April.  It will not be adjourned.  It will be reserved to me.  The hearing will concentrate solely on the issues identified in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B-S</span>.  I will not consider anything else.  If there has to be oral evidence, it will be extremely strictly controlled.  </p>
