	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application by a wife for financial remedy orders after a short marriage which lasted some 19 months to the date of the parties&#8217; separation.  Both parties are still young but together they have a child, A, who was born in January 2015 and is now 22 months old.  For the majority of his life thus far, he has been cared for by his mother, the parties having separated when he was only 4 months old.  There is little liquid capital in the case but the husband has a substantial (but potentially time-limited) earning capacity.  Both parties accept that there is no marital acquest to be shared.  The issue, therefore, is the basis upon which the wife's future needs for housing and income should be met.  Should she be entitled to live in owner-occupied accommodation purchased through means of a repayment mortgage or is this a case where her future needs with A will be met through the provision of rented accommodation ?  In either event, at what level should the husband be required to support that household given that the (admittedly) high standard of living which they enjoyed during the marriage was limited to the relatively short lifespan of their shared living arrangements ?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">W is 31 years old; H will celebrate his 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday next month.  He is a professional footballer.  Having formerly played for a team in the English Premier League, he is now working abroad.  His current contract (which provides him with an income of c.&#163;1 million per annum net, depending on the prevailing <span style="font-style:italic">fx </span>rates) expires in June 2019.  Thereafter, the future remains uncertain.  I have been shown copies of press reports which speculate upon his prospects of even greater sporting glories.  Perhaps prompted by such speculation, his current club has indicated a willingness to open negotiations about renewing his contract.  H has not yet engaged in those discussions, preferring to concentrate on completing the current season.  Whether or not that is some indication of his own expectations in relation to the possibility of a transfer remains to be seen.  In any event, W accepts that, whilst the future is uncertain, it is likely that the present <span style="font-style:italic">scale </span>of his income is finite.  She accepts that in four or five years&#8217; time &#8211; barring injury in the meantime - when his playing career comes to an end, it is unlikely that he will be earning a six or seven figure income.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She herself has no income and a very limited earning capacity at the present time.  She was working as a beautician when she and H began a relationship in 2011.  She has not worked since 2010 and her time is now devoted to looking after A.  They married in October 2013 in France (both are French nationals, although W was brought up in north London from the age of about six) and their only child was born in January 2015.  They have never owned a home together.  The former matrimonial home was a rented property in the north of England for which they were paying just under &#163;52,000 per annum.  That property extended to some 4,000 square feet with five reception rooms, four bathrooms, a gym and a large garden with an extended decked area and hot tub.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst it is not necessary to go into any great detail, I am satisfied that the standard of living which they enjoyed over the course of their marriage was high.  That much is borne out by the fact that, notwithstanding the costs of this litigation (to which I shall return later), there is virtually no capital in the case despite the level at which H was earning.   Both parties accept that they lived life to the full with virtually no constraints on their ability to indulge themselves in terms of discretionary spending on clothes, holidays and (if I may be forgiven for describing it as such) the paraphernalia which so often features in these lifestyle choices.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Much criticism is made by H&#8217;s team of W&#8217;s aspirations to perpetuate that lifestyle following the demise of her relationship with H.  They accuse her of overspending on all fronts from her current rented home to the sums she spends on holidays and clothes for herself and A.  W&#8217;s team, in their turn, point to the fact that H&#8217;s own spending has continued unchecked since the separation some eighteen months ago.  They point to a six figure sum which he spent on a holiday to Los Angeles with friends in the aftermath of the separation.  He accepts this criticism to an extent; he told me that he felt frustrated by the breakdown of the marriage and the litigation which ensued. He accepts that he overspent on the trip.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the material in the bundle are several pages of texts and emails which were exchanged between the parties in the weeks and months following their separation.  I need say no more about these for the purposes of this judgment.  They do not shed a particularly favourable light on either of these parties but they do, perhaps, provide a context for the heated (and hugely expensive) litigation which followed.  (Neither of their current firms of solicitors was then acting, each of H and W having changed their representation since these proceedings were commenced.)</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That said, I am satisfied that W has yet to come fully to terms with the breakdown of the marriage.  There was some <span style="font-style:italic">rapprochement </span>between them in May this year when H travelled to London to spend time with A.  Thereafter, they spent time together in Paris.  W clearly wished for a reconciliation.  Despite the fact that she became pregnant as a result of the time they spent together, it seems that the damage was done as far as the future of this marriage was concerned.  That she miscarried at an early stage of her pregnancy in circumstances where H was less than supportive of that pregnancy continuing has no doubt created additional tensions between them.  There was a further attempt at reconciliation in August this year when W took A to Europe to see his father.  That, too, ended badly with W alleging that she was thrown out of H&#8217;s rented home and had to spend a night in a local hotel before returning to London.  It was very obvious to me when she gave her evidence that she has not yet disengaged emotionally from her relationship with H.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the proceedings, they began in May 2015 when W issued a petition seeking dissolution of the marriage, together with an application for financial remedy orders.  By this stage, H had moved out of their rented home and shortly thereafter moved to Europe to take up his contract with his new club.  Complaint is made by W about the fact that he gave notice to the landlord and terminated the lease of what had been their family home.  In any event, it appears to have been agreed between their (then) solicitors that she and A should return to north London and rent alternative accommodation whilst the proceedings took their course. I have seen a letter from her former solicitors, Vardags, dated 28 July 2015.  That letter records H&#8217;s agreement to her move.</p>

Accordingly, we enclose property particulars for three properties in the St John&#8217;s Wood area in relation to which our client is arranging urgent viewings, as examples of the types of properties that she hopes will be suitable to meet her and [A&#8217;s] interim housing needs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties were unable to agree upon an appropriate level of interim financial support for W and A.  On 28 August 2015, she secured an order in the Central Family Court in respect of maintenance pending suit and provision for her legal costs.  H was ordered to pay &#163;30,000 per month apportioned as to &#163;15,000 per month for her general maintenance (including rent) and the balance for her legal fees.  In addition, H was required to fund &#163;11,550 by way of a deposit on her new rented home.  The temporary home which W rented in Finchley (in which she is still living) is a five bedroom property with four bathrooms.  Notwithstanding the representations which her previous solicitors had made in relation to the likely cost of renting, she is paying &#163;65,000 per annum (nearly &#163;5,500 per month), or more than double the estimate which her solicitors had previously given.  Thus W&#8217;s disposable income under the interim order has been in the order of some &#163;9,500 per month.  Much complaint is made by Mr Leech on behalf of H about W&#8217;s decision to rent at this level.  He submits that this is yet one more example of her failure to appreciate the new financial realities of life and her clear wish to perpetuate the sort of lifestyle she was able to enjoy whilst the marriage subsisted.</p>

Both parties were ordered to provide further financial disclosure and to set out their respective cases as to W&#8217;s future housing needs and evidence of mortgage capacity.  At that stage, W was seeking to raise issues in relation to H&#8217;s spending in the context of a future &#8216;add back&#8217; or reattribution claim. (Happily, that claim has not been pursued in the context of this hearing.)</p>

It remains the basis of H&#8217;s case for the purposes of this final hearing.  By this stage, it appears that W had spent approximately &#163;234,000 on legal costs in nine months of litigation.   She did not respond to that offer and thereafter it appears that, from her side, there was no further engagement in settlement discussions for several months.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matter was back before the court in mid-May this year (2016) when W renewed her application for interim provision for her legal costs.  I dealt with that application at which Mr Leech represented H and Mr Nicholas Chapman represented W.  Agreement was reached on the basis that a sum of approximately &#163;30,000 (the proceeds of sale from H&#8217;s Ferrari) would be paid to W&#8217;s solicitors to cover funding for the months from March to April 2016.  Thereafter, her costs were to be funded by H at the rate of &#163;5,000 per month.  There were ongoing issues about the state of H&#8217;s financial disclosure in the proceedings.  Other than to direct him to file a budget, I declined to order replies to a further questionnaire.  Despite complaints from W&#8217;s team that H had yet to provide full disclosure of his financial affairs, it seemed to me that there was no proper evidential foundation for a non-disclosure case against H.  Happily, no such allegations have been pursued at this hearing.</p>

The balance of some US$482,000 is due by the end of 2017 when construction will be complete.  Should he default on this payment, he will forfeit the sum he has already paid.  Thus, on the assumption that the purchase price is equivalent to value on completion in 2017 (and that may or may not be a sound assumption), there is equity of some &#163;374,000 in the Miami condominium albeit that such value is extinguished by the corresponding obligation to fund the second instalment in 2017.</p>

He is offshore and has no assets of which to speak in this jurisdiction.  In circumstances where she aspires to buy a home with a mortgage which she will repay out of the periodical payments she receives from H, W will have to identify a potential lender who is prepared to advance funds on that basis.  From the foot of enquiries which she made at the beginning of this year, it appeared that she might be able to borrow &#163;810,000 on the basis of maintenance from H of &#163;15,000 per month (&#163;180,000 per annum).  Within the bundle, I have a much more recent letter from a firm of financial advisers dated 16 November 2016 which suggests that, with maintenance receipts of &#163;26,500 per month (&#163;318,000 per annum), she could secure a mortgage advance of &#163;1.1 million provided that she was in a position to put down a cash deposit of 35% loan to value.  This evidence has only emerged in the course of the last few days.  The new presentation from the financial adviser who was approached on her behalf appears to have been calculated on the basis of a repayment mortgage which would be paid down over 8 to 10 years.  If the shorter period were chosen, her monthly repayments would be &#163;14,183 per month (or &#163;170,196 per annum).  If the mortgage period was extended to 10 years, the monthly repayments would be &#163;11,933 (or &#163;143,196 per annum).</p>

She has produced no fewer than three separate detailed budgets over the course of this litigation.  Her original Form E budget appears to set out a requirement for an annual sum of &#163;565,158. That figure was predicated on the basis of the provision of a property in central/North London.  It takes no account of mortgage or rental payments.  However, its structure is not easy to follow and a composite breakdown of the figures produced on the final page suggests that her total household and personal outgoings come to just under &#163;305,000 per annum with expenses specifically referable to A being just under &#163;108,500 per annum.  This suggests a slightly reduced total of &#163;413,190 per annum in round figures.

I make due allowance for the fact that, as she herself accepts, W lacks the financial sophistication to penetrate the figures forensically.  I do not intend to imply any criticism of her by that observation.  She has experienced the lifestyle to which she now seeks to aspire for a limited period of time as H&#8217;s partner and wife. She has never been in control of her finances during the course of the marriage.  Together, she and H were able to spend at a prodigious rate and it is hardly surprising that she has found it difficult to provide her solicitors with a solid evidential platform to support the figures for which she is now contending.  What I do know is that there is little now to show for the significant income which H has earned over the course of the last twenty-two months.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Southgate has put together a table showing a total spend of just under &#163;2.6 million, an annual &#8220;burn&#8221; rate of some &#163;1.4 million.  Even allowing for the sum of almost &#163;696,000 which has been spent on the costs of this litigation, he points to about &#163;1.9 million which has been consumed on living costs both before and after the separation in the last 22 months.  It is accepted that a not insignificant element of that expenditure has been diverted towards the support of H&#8217;s wider family whom he was maintaining before he met W.  Mr Leech has been able to demonstrate that, in addition, W has been the beneficiary of some &#163;453,200 in terms of what she has received in respect of her rent, maintenance pending suit payments and costs paid to her lawyers.</p>

Simple and fair guidance is needed so that the majority of cases can be settled.  Settlement is almost always better than adjudication for a divorcing couple.  And the functioning of the family justice system depends on a high rate of settlement of these cases.  Save in the exceptional kind of case exemplified in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller v Miller; McFarlane v McFarlane </span>a periodical payments claim (whether determined originally or on variation) should in my opinion be adjudged (or settled), generally speaking, by reference to the principal of need alone.  Of course needs are elastic in concept and there is much room for the exercise of discretion in their assessment.  But to allow consideration of the concept of sharing to intrude in the assessment of a periodical payments award seems to me to be based on a doubtful principle, and is replete with problems of quantification by any sure standard.  The sharing principle in relation to matrimonial property is simple enough: it is usually 50/50, because in the division of the marital acquest equity (or fairness) is (usually) equality.  But if the concept of sharing is going to uplift above the assessment of need a periodical payments award which will be paid from post-separation earnings, how does a judge set about doing it ?  Is it a third ? Or 40% ? Or 20% ? There are not even any signposts along the road to a fair award.&#8221;</p>

He was able to demonstrate that she had quite simply not thought through the financial implications of her current offer.  No provision had been made in her housing calculations for stamp duty of some &#163;130,000.  Once that cost was factored into the equation, what she would actually need to acquire her first choice of the properties she produced was a sum of c.&#163;1.985 million.  Even if a mortgage of &#163;1.1m were to be made available, she would need a cash sum of &#163;760,000 to pay the 35% deposit and stamp duty.  Given the available resources in this case, that appeared to be unachievable in circumstances where she still had to find a further &#163;175,000 odd to discharge her outstanding costs to her lawyers.</p>

Given the levels at which she has been spending since the separation, she is going to need to completely recalibrate her expenditure if she is to manage her finances in future.  A mortgage of &#163;1 million or &#163;1.1 million is a tall order for any wife who has no experience at all of managing her domestic economy in a home where she will be responsible for all the running costs out of a finite monthly sum.  She told me that, over and above her rent and utility bills, she has spent most of her income on clothes and toys for A.  (As she put it, &#8220;Clothes, toys, and then more clothes and toys&#8221;.)  When she was asked by Mr Southgate to give the court an example of a recent purchase, she told me about an outing to a well-known London department store where she paid nearly &#163;600 for a coat and hat for A. (I remind myself that A is not yet 2 years old.)

In the current climate of economic uncertainty with all the speculation and volatility which persists in this post-Brexit era, a number of pertinent questions need to be addressed.  Where will the property market be heading in 18 months&#8217; or two years&#8217; time when W plans to buy ?  Will the estate agents&#8217; particulars which have been relied on as evidence in this case then represent the realistic cost of acquiring an appropriate home for W and A ?  If not, will the market have fallen off significantly or will she need more to purchase an equivalent property ?  What will happen to interest rates over the intervening period ?  Are the mortgage projections which I have been given reliable indicators of what it will cost in late 2018 and beyond to service and repay the debt which W anticipates taking on for the purposes of acquiring her future home ?  Is it possible that interest rates will have risen to a point where she has to significantly trim her expectations in relation to the level of debt which she can service out of her maintenance payments ?  Given that H will be meeting her award out of an income which is paid in euros, does the possibility of further significant currency fluctuations preclude the court from reaching an outcome in these proceedings which will remain fair to both parties over the course of the next seven years at which point the review is contemplated ?  How will recent political developments on the other side of the Atlantic affect the US economy over the course of the next two or three years, and what impact might any changes have on property values in Miami ?  Is it fair that W should be able to continue to stockpile getting on for &#163;200,000 per annum which would otherwise be deployed in paying down a mortgage if, for example, H was unable to find a purchaser for the Miami property for any significant period of time after its completion in 2018 ?    How do I factor in the &#8220;unknown&#8221; in respect of the possibility of a new contract which could (potentially) lift his income into football&#8217;s financial stratosphere ?  Any such increase could make what now looks like a fairly tight position of liquidity and cash flow seem eminently realistic, proportionate and fair. How will W proceed with her proposed purchase if H sustains an injury between now and the latter part of 2018 or if, for some other reason, there is an interruption in his playing career ?  </p>

My first consideration is the welfare of A throughout his minority.  His need for stability through his childhood and beyond will be provided largely through the care which he receives from his mother.  Whilst I accept that H has much to offer his son (and I accept as entirely genuine his wish to play a full part in his upbringing), the reality of life for this family is that the lion&#8217;s share of that burden will fall on W&#8217;s shoulders, as it has to date.  A&#8217;s parents will not be living in the same country.  His father&#8217;s timetable will be dictated almost entirely by the demands of his career as a professional footballer over the next four or five years and perhaps beyond.  W needs to be in a position to provide a stable and secure home for herself and A and to have the resources to run that home to an appropriate standard which bears some correlation to the resources available to the parties both now and in the future.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S 25(2)</ref>(a) requires me to look to the resources which are likely to be available in the foreseeable future including, in the case of an earning capacity, any increase in that capacity which it would be reasonable to expect one of the parties to acquire.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this context, I am satisfied that W has virtually no earning capacity at the present time.  Once A is in nursery school (and he is likely to be attending for most of the day with effect from 2018/19), she is very unlikely to earn much more than &#163;15,000 gross per annum by pursuing her former career as a beautician.  Even if she earns at that level, she is likely to have additional child care costs which will neutralise the financial benefit of part (if not all) of that income.  That she will have to return to some form of paid employment is, in my judgment, a &#8220;given&#8221; in this case but she is never going to earn at a level which enables her to make a significant contribution to her own domestic economy for so long as she has responsibilities for a pre-school child.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H, on the other hand, will have free rein to continue to develop his career as a professional footballer.  I have no doubt that his career trajectory is something which has been, and will continue to be, carefully managed and nurtured by those around him.  There is already some evidence of the value which his present club attaches to retaining him as part of the team at the end of his current contract.  H&#8217;s evidence to me about this was entirely open and, in my assessment, honest.  He does not wish to commit himself one way or the other until the end of the current season.  By that stage (June 2017) he is likely to know if any of the press speculation about his future has an anchor in substance and reality.  He is keeping his options open and he cannot be criticised for adopting that position.  I cannot speculate about what the future holds for him.  Instead, I intend to proceed on the basis that he is likely to maintain his current level of earnings until at least 2020 (i.e. for the next four years).  Of course, were he to sustain a career-changing injury, as Mr Southgate acknowledges, &#8220;all bets are off&#8221;.  In that event, as he accepts, W and A would undoubtedly have to look again at the options including a return to the rented sector.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am similarly enjoined to consider the standard of living which the parties were able to enjoy prior to the breakdown of the marriage: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25(2)</ref>(c).  Clearly, the standard of living in this case was high.  There is no doubt that these parties spent all (and more) of what H earnt.   There is more or less no capital to divide and such assets as remain are neutralised entirely by liabilities (which include debts on both sides for significant unpaid legal costs).  However, that standard of living has to be looked at in terms of the length of the marriage.  Where, as here, the marriage was short-lived, the impact of consistently high marital expenditure over a relatively short period finds less resonance or reflection in the standard of living which a former (maintained) spouse is entitled to expect in future.  In this context, it is worth bearing in mind what Moylan J said recently in <span style="font-style:italic">BD v FD </span>[2016] EWHC (Fam) 594.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept Mr Southgate&#8217;s primary submission that the presence of A is an overarching consideration in this case.  His needs inform those of his mother to a significant extent but, in this context, it is important to focus on the substance of those needs.  He needs love, security, a comfortable home, and a standard of living which is commensurate with the fact that, for the next few years, his father is likely to be earning significant sums.  However it seems to me that, in this particular case, there is an obligation on <span style="font-style:italic">both </span>of these parents to take advantage of the benefits which that high income will bring in order to make provision for the adjustments which will be necessary once that income reduces significantly, if not ends altogether.   In my judgment, the fact that H and W were able to indulge themselves in terms of their discretionary spending over less than two years of their marriage carries less weight in this case than the obligations which both must accept to make provision for the future.  W is still relatively young and, notwithstanding her current role as mother to a very young child, she will be expected to take what steps she can along the road to eventual financial independence.  To his credit, H acknowledges and accepts that there should be no automatic cut off point or cessation of her entitlement to periodical payments at this stage although he does seek a review seven years down the line.  It seems to me that W&#8217;s wish to embark on that journey towards independence from the base of a secure home is a reasonable aspiration in the circumstances of this case provided that her housing needs are contained within the ambit of what is reasonable in all the circumstances of this particular case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It has to be borne carefully in mind that there is an inter-relationship between the <span style="font-style:italic">level </span>at which future needs will be assessed and the <span style="font-style:italic">period </span>during which a court is likely to find those needs should be met by the paying former spouse.  The longer the period, the more likely it is that the court will decline to assess those needs on the basis of a standard of living which replicates that enjoyed during the marriage.  In my judgment those principles apply in this case equally to the assessment of W&#8217;s housing and income needs.   Whilst I understand that the rented property in the north of England which was the former matrimonial home was a very comfortable and spacious property with all the trappings of &#8216;life lived in the fast lane&#8217;, it was not a property in which either of these parties had any financial interest whatsoever.  It was their home for a very short period of time and thus its use as a benchmark for W&#8217;s future housing needs is, in my judgment, of limited significance regardless of the type of property which H is renting on a short term basis close to his team&#8217;s headquarters in Europe.  I also have to bear in mind that her recent move south to the environs of central London, albeit with H&#8217;s agreement, is an additional factor which has to be weighed in the balance when considering her needs.  The acquisition of a stake or foothold in the London property market will inevitably come with a higher price tag for this family. Realistically, H has accepted that W&#8217;s aspirations to remain within easy reach of her family and support network are achievable goals in this case.</p>

Nevertheless, as I listened to him I formed the view that H is genuinely conscious of the need to provide for a future where his current level of earnings is likely to be consigned to history.  He told me candidly that he had not been careful with money when he was younger.  He accepts that he &#8220;blew&#8221; a wholly unreasonable sum of money on an expensive holiday with friends when the marriage ended.  He recognises the need to make provision for the future and, in doing so, he appeared to accept that it was not unreasonable for W to wish to do the same.   They disagree on the entry level in respect of housing for W but, by the conclusion of the case, there was at least an acceptance in principle by H that her aspiration for security was reasonable.</p>

Mr Marks submits that, as well as meeting her annual needs, payments must also be made to the wife to enable her (in his words) to &#8220;stockpile&#8221;.  He submits that, just as the husband has included &#163;100,000 per annum in his budget under a heading &#8220;Pension&#8221;, she needs to be able to make some similar provision of pension or stockpile for herself.

It must be clearly understood that the stockpile is intended to enable the wife to build up funds so as to be self-supporting upon the husband&#8217;s death, or if he earlier retires and his income markedly reduces. If the wife does invest the stockpile in a more valuable home by financing a mortgage, then in due course she will have to trade down so as to release funds for income.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On this basis, as the cash flow analysis demonstrates, if W discharges the balance of her legal costs during the first 12 months of the currency of the periodical payments order (when she will still be renting), she will probably stockpile a sum of just over &#163;46,000.  (This, in effect, is what she will save in the first year when she has no mortgage liability.)  However, the total cost to H of meeting that order in the first year, including the final payment which he must make in relation to the Miami apartment, is in excess of &#163;700,000, an equivalent of some 78% of his (assumed) guaranteed income.  Thereafter, W&#8217;s position remains the same throughout the next seven years as she continues to pay down her mortgage liability.  Her yearly &#8216;net spendable&#8217; after mortgage repayments remains more or less constant at c. &#163;132,000 per annum.  When an appropriate allowance is made for the costs of A&#8217;s nursery / pre-prep fees, H will be paying to W some 37% of his income.  After two years when (as W accepted as likely) his income reduces, the percentage which she receives will increase to in excess of 50% of his income.  When allowance is made for the other charges on his disposable income (such as the liability he has assumed for his mother&#8217;s mortgage and the fees he pays to his father who acts as his agent), he will retain only about 37% of his guaranteed income.  In my judgment, this outcome is not fair to H and it leaves in W&#8217;s hands more than she needs.  The majority of her income would be applied towards a very significant repayment mortgage which she would have taken out to fund the purchase of a property which is, as I find, in excess of her and A&#8217;s reasonable needs.  In this context, and after a marriage of this length, I do not consider it is appropriate to factor in any sharing of, or entitlement to, H&#8217;s bonuses.  These are paid according to his own, and the team&#8217;s, future performance.  If bonuses are received in future, I accept they may go some way to mitigating the straitened cash flow position which I have outlined above.  But, in my judgment, these are not payments which should be built into any cash flow analysis when considering the net effect (and thus the fairness) of the competing proposals which each of H and W are advancing.</p>

She told me that she believed she would need at least &#163;1 million to buy anything decent in central London.  Later she mentioned a figure of &#163;1.4 million.  By the time we commenced the second day of her evidence, Mr Southgate had put before the court details of a new property in Lawrence Avenue, NW7.  This was being advertised for sale with an asking price of just under &#163;1.25 million.  It is described in these terms:</p>

The property in which she will make a home with A will, for the majority of the time, be occupied by the two of them alone.   There is no plan to accommodate a live in nanny.  I was told that her brother visits and stays overnight from time to time but that is not a regular arrangement.  After a marriage of this length and in circumstances where W is seeking financial provision for many years into the future during A&#8217;s minority, she does not need four bedrooms or such a substantial property.  Whilst, at this level, her mortgage spend reduces to just under &#163;97,000 net per annum, she would (on her figure of &#163;318,000 per annum) be stockpiling about &#163;90,000 every year whilst, in circumstances where &#8211; as W herself accepted &#8211; his income was reducing, H retained less than 50% of his income (or some 37% odd after discharging his liabilities to other family members).  </p>

As I have already said earlier in this judgment, much is based on uncertainty and speculation about what the future holds.  If H&#8217;s playing career ends prematurely for whatever reason, W&#8217;s objective of securing a foothold in the property market will have to be abandoned, as Mr Southgate readily accepts.  I have to do the best I can on the evidence which is currently available to me and any future contingencies or material changes of circumstances will have to be addressed in a future variation application if the parties are unable to agree the way forward.</p>

The properties have been plotted on a map which shows that W&#8217;s current rented home is more or less equidistant between two of the properties.  These are both in the NW7 area of Finchley where she told me she wanted to live.  The first is a freehold three bedroom semi-detached modern property which is currently being offered at &#163;635,000.  It has a garden and is close to a selection of local amenities.    It is situated in what is described as a mainly residential area of North London &#8220;with a real sense of community&#8221; and close to &#8220;the respected Mill Hill School&#8221;. The property appears to be modern and well maintained, although I appreciate that W did not have an opportunity to view it.  The ground floor living accommodation is well laid out and the property has a reasonably spacious modern kitchen.</p>

She was not able to give me any realistic or rational explanation as to why either of these two properties would not be suitable.  She described one as looking like a &#8220;box&#8221; and asked, rhetorically, where A would find the space to run around with his three cars.  Of the other she told me that she did not see how she would be able to fit all his toys into the property.  These did not seem to me to be solid or appropriate reasons for rejecting these family homes as unsuitable for her future needs.  She said that they were not in the &#8220;right part&#8221; of Finchley although she was unable to elaborate any further on why their specific location made them unsuitable.  I accept that, as examples of what is available in the area, they occupy a different level of the local housing market from some of the property particulars she has produced but that does not, without more, make them unsuitable or inappropriate as examples of the type of home into which W and A can settle quite comfortably once she has the wherewithal to put down a deposit.  In my judgment, and despite the fact that it is not his primary case, Mr Leech is on fairly solid ground in advancing these properties as potential candidates for meeting her future housing needs.</p>

Thus, the &#8216;up front&#8217; cost to her in 2018 will be somewhere in the region of &#163;270,000 depending on the extent to which she is able to negotiate around the price.  I was not provided with any examples of particulars in the &#163;1 million price range (that being the figure which W told me was her &#8216;entry&#8217; level into this particular market).  However, on the basis of a purchase at &#163;1 million, she would need to find an additional &#163;43,750 for SDLT and &#163;350,000 by way of a deposit (a total of &#163;393,750).  She would need a mortgage of &#163;650,000 which, depending on the mortgage term and the rate she is able to secure, is likely to cost somewhere in excess of &#163;100,000 per annum.

Significantly, I am reinforced in that view by the fact that, on H&#8217;s primary case, she will be renting at a cost of &#163;3,500 pcm (or &#163;42,000 per annum).   That is money which will to all intents and purposes be wasted.  The differential between that sum and the annual cost of a repayment mortgage with an entry level (or purchase price) of &#163;650,000 to &#163;700,000 is such that it can, as I find, be absorbed as part and parcel of an appropriate, and affordable, award of periodical payments.</p>

Economies are inevitable in terms of her discretionary spending.  Notwithstanding the very high income which H will continue to earn over the course of the next two or three years, those economies are, in effect, the quid pro quo for the security she will be building up as she pays down the mortgage.  In my judgment, this is not a case where she is entitled to look to H to provide her with capital security over time whilst, in parallel with that obligation, requiring him to replicate the standard of living (or something close to it) which she describes during the short period of time they were married to one another.  The analysis of her own proposals demonstrates that she would be left with a net spendable income of no more than c.&#163;132,000 per annum.  I know not whether she had thought through the implications of the mortgage debt she was proposing to take on in terms of her future cash flow, but I suspect there may be some truth in Mr Leech&#8217;s submission that she was pitching her claims at their highest in order to secure a maximum award on the basis she would do the number-crunching thereafter. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is, of course, an obvious correlation between my assessment of her housing needs and the appropriate award of periodical payments which, here, must be sufficient to absorb the impact of the mortgage repayments. In my deliberations about the fair outcome in this case, I have found myself commuting between &#163;700,000 and &#163;1 million as an appropriate housing fund for W.  The evidence leads me to conclude that the lower sum, on today&#8217;s prices, will be perfectly adequate to purchase appropriate accommodation in the general area in which she wishes to live.  Of course she could buy a slightly better property with an extra &#163;300,000 but, in my judgment, she does not need that uplift.  The mortgage on a &#163;700,000 property is likely to be easily contained within an allowance of &#163;80,000 per annum for repayment over an 8 or 10 year period.    I cannot at this stage speculate about the exact cost because I do not know what rate she will be offered when, in 2018 or on the later sale of the Miami apartment, she is in a position to buy.  </p>

I agree with Mr Leech&#8217;s approach that there is inevitably an instinctive figure which is likely to emerge from the totality of the evidence which has been put before the court.  W accepted in her evidence that, at the end of the day, she will work within the budget which the court considers appropriate.  However, judicial instinct, shaped and honed as it is by experience of many previous similar cases, has nevertheless to be anchored to some basis or rationale.</p>

Taking the mid-point of those figures, his offer of global support at the rate of &#163;144,000 per annum thereafter would have provided her with an annual sum of &#163;108,000 per annum for living costs once she had paid rent.  The true net effect of her open proposal (&#163;318,000 per annum) is likely to have left her with a disposable income after mortgage costs of something in the order of &#163;132,000 per annum.  I am satisfied that a budget of &#163;120,000 per annum (including child support but <span style="font-weight:bold">exclusive </span>of mortgage costs) is ample for this wife&#8217;s and A&#8217;s ongoing needs.  It will give her &#163;10,000 per month to defray all her costs.  As to how that sum is apportioned as between W and A, I have no strong views either way although I would suggest that W&#8217;s figure of &#163;3,000 per month in respect of child support is not an unreasonable sum. This would result in an award of periodical payments to W in the sum of &#163;84,000 per annum and &#163;36,000 per annum for child maintenance.  Together with the mortgage allowance of &#163;80,000 per annum, H&#8217;s total liability will be &#163;200,000 per annum at least for the next seven years or the end of his playing career.  In addition, he must discharge the nursery / pre-prep fees for A as and when they fall due.  If A is to attend the local nursery which W has identified, this will cost an additional &#163;7,500 in 2018 rising to &#163;14,000 from 2019.</p>

On the basis of Mr Leech&#8217;s assumptions as to his likely earnings in the three years between 2018 and 2020 (assumptions which are underpinned and supported to an extent by W&#8217;s own evidence as to the foreseeable tapering off of his earnings by that point in time), he will retain the balance of his &#163;900,000 annual net income (i.e. &#163;686,000 or 76%).  Notwithstanding the other calls on his income from extended family members, I am satisfied that there is adequate scope within that income to enable him to make provision for his own housing needs whether he chooses to meet those needs through renting and investing on a commercial basis or whether he, too, chooses to buy a home for himself.  I suspect that the somewhat peripatetic demands of his future career may dictate what he decides to do.  Ultimately, that is a matter for him but I am satisfied that he can afford to make provision for his own future on either basis.

Thus, she will have some &#163;15,000 surplus in Year 1 which she can use to discharge part of these liabilities. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am satisfied that the proceeds off sale of the Hale property should be released to W forthwith upon decree absolute.  Together with the &#163;15,000 surplus to which I have referred above, she will have a total of &#163;110,000 to put towards her costs liability leaving a balance of &#163;65,000 to clear the outstanding debt.  It seems to me that repayment of the Vardags debt will have to be given priority since they hold what is in effect a first charge on all monies recovered by W in this litigation.  The balance of that debt (i.e. &#163;35,000) and the sum which she owes her present solicitors (&#163;30,000) can only come from one of two sources.  Either &#163;65,000 must be found on an instalment basis from such savings as she is able to make from her income or it will have to come from the capital / liquid funds which H retains.  That capital consists of his unpaid bonus (&#8364;100,000 or c.&#163;85,500) and whatever equity is realised on a sale of the Miami apartment (currently estimated to be &#163;374,000).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In order to gain any traction on the housing market, and in accordance with my findings in relation to her housing needs, W will require a cash deposit of &#163;270,000 (which includes SDLT).  I am satisfied that this sum should be paid to her from the net proceeds of sale of the Miami apartment.  On current projections, and on the basis H makes the final payment due on completion, it will provide her with just over 36% of the net proceeds and her entitlement should be expressed in the alternative as the greater of that fixed lump sum or 36% of the eventual sale proceeds.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Because I take the view that both parties must share responsibility for the costs of this litigation (which global costs I regard as excessive and wholly disproportionate to the issues in the case), I am not going to require H to make available to her a further lump sum to enable her to clear <span style="font-style:italic">in full</span> her residual liability for costs (&#163;65,000).  He has his own costs to pay and I bear well in mind that W made no contribution to the purchase of the Miami apartment which is in its essential character non-matrimonial property.  Whilst I was originally minded to leave that outstanding liability for her account alone, I have to accord due weight to the fact that this is a needs-driven case.  Because I have calculated W&#8217;s income needs as realistically as I can (albeit on a basis which reflects H&#8217;s very substantial income receipts over the course of the next few years), there is unlikely to be sufficient flexibility in her budget to repay &#163;65,000 over a time frame which is acceptable to her lawyers.  For this reason, and this reason alone, I am prepared to require H to contribute a further sum of &#163;32,500 (which represents 50% of her residual costs debt).  I do that purely and simply on the basis of reducing her outstanding debt to a figure which I regard as manageable out of her future income.  In other circumstances I might have required H to wipe the slate clean for her in respect of legal costs but I cannot ignore the fact that it took many months for her to respond on an open basis to his February 2016 proposal.  By the time her open offer came, it was too late to avoid the majority of the costs which had by then been incurred.  On the other hand, H&#8217;s concession that it would be reasonable for W to become an owner occupier provided that the cost of her accommodation was reasonable only came as he was giving his oral evidence   I am certainly not seeking to level criticism at any one particular firm and I acknowledge that each of the current firms of solicitors involved in this case has had to &#8220;run&#8221; with the costs which they inherited from their predecessors.  However, it is trite law that a party can only protect his or her position in relation to costs by making <span style="font-style:italic">open </span>offers.  That is how the system now works following the change in the rules.  This is, at the end of the day, a case which is driven by W&#8217;s needs.  I am satisfied that H will be able to find the additional &#163;32,500 out of income given that he may well be in line for a bonus payment or performance fee in the coming months.  Whilst I have declined to take these payments into account when assessing his disposable income for the purposes of calculating W&#8217;s periodical payments, they do nevertheless provide additional cash flow for H.  </p>

Of that sum, up to &#163;80,000 per annum shall be earmarked for mortgage repayments over an 8 or 10 year period.  In terms of safeguards, Mr Southgate suggested in closing submissions that these sums could be diverted to the lender via his instructing solicitors.  I can see practical difficulties with this arrangement but, if it is one which is acceptable to all the parties, I shall not interfere in those arrangements.  It may be that further thought is needed before committing the arrangement to a final order of the court.  The purpose will be to protect the stockpiled mortgage funds so as to ensure that W is indeed building up equity in her home and not dissipating that portion of the maintenance payments on other discretionary expenditure.</p>

In addition, H will discharge his nursery/pre-school costs and any other agreed educational costs up to the point of the seven year review.  I would hope that A&#8217;s transition from pre-school to junior school (which is likely to take place before the review) will not give rise to further disagreement between his parents.  It is too soon at this stage to make any judgment call in relation to where he should continue his secondary school career.  W told me that he can move seamlessly at the G School from pre-school to infant school.  If that is the case, I would hope that H will agree to continue funding that placement.  It is certainly affordable on the basis of his present income.</p>
