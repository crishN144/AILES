One of my enduring memories of this case will be the experience of watching the cross examination by  Mr Goodwin QC of Professor Hindmarsh; it was one of the best that I have ever seen in my 43 years as a lawyer and the Professor&#8217;s responses to questions showed why he is a world leader in his field. </span></p>

I would suggest, respectfully, that anyone reading this judgment might wish to look at that bundle at this stage. The information that it records comes from devices and systems that are explained in the glossary. The schedule that I have prepared sets out the dates upon which AB was in hospital and colour codes the table in the appendix to say when that was. It also records how insulin was being delivered to AB at the relevant times and colour codes that information on the table. Although the information in the &#8216;DM&#8217; bundle is important and gives some immediate insight into AB&#8217;s daily blood glucose levels, like every other class of evidence in this case, it has to be approached with caution not least because:</span></p>

There had been times, before that diagnosis, that she struggled with his behaviour; there are school reports to which I will refer that show that.  Initially, after AB&#8217;s diagnosis, she coped reasonably well with his diabetic care up to about the end of February 2021. After AB had undergone three long periods as an inpatient, during which she remained with him, she stopped coping adequately with his diabetic care in about mid-June 2021.</span></p>

Much has been said about it at this hearing. The mother&#8217;s dyscalculia did not prevent her from absorbing, at the time it was given, most of the well-delivered training about diabetic care that she received from the skilled and specialist nurses at the hospital and applying most of it, usually. She dealt adequately with regular dosing and the use of the equipment with which she was provided. None of the nurses identified any major mistakes that she made. However, I accept that more intricate calculations in relation to the management of AB&#8217;s diabetic care would have been very difficult for her, especially at times of heightened stress &#8211; for example, some &#8216;carb counting&#8217;, calculating doses to avoid &#8216;stacking&#8217; (i.e. giving too many doses on top of each other), preparation for and the consequences of physical exercise with correct dosing, how to respond to intercurrent illness with correct dosing, heatwaves, changes in insulin regime and the other matters considered by Professor Hindmarsh at E68.  From AB&#8217;s point of view: i) those are the sort of things that a parent caring for a diabetic child must be able to deal with, since they are recurrent; ii) the effect on the child of not dealing with them can be extremely serious.  </span></p>

Those messages have to be considered both cumulatively and individually in context. Having done so and having reflected hard about them, my opinion is that many of them simply show the mother seeking sympathy and using exaggerated terms about AB&#8217;s circumstances to that end. For her to have done that in texts with men that she has met online, speaks of an emotional loneliness which, I think, is sad and resonates with what I have said in paragraph 21. </span></p>

The exaggeration in those messages has to be placed in the context of a mother who did not exaggerate to professionals, especially medics, who did not want AB to be in hospital, who was distressed by the medical treatment that AB had to undergo and who is very closely and lovingly attached to him. There is no suggestion that she manipulated medics. She was not attention seeking with medics, nurses or the school. There is no evidence that the exaggerated messages translated themselves into action or attempted medical treatment of AB. She is a long way from the sort of &#8216;FII by proxy&#8217; parent that is seen in more egregious cases and which, initially, she was portrayed to be. The original suggestions of chronic and covert insulin maladministration have not been substantiated and cannot be so. </span></p>

In very simple language, she was not coping. At times AB was dangerously and repeatedly hypoglycaemic (a quick glance at DM-I30-31 tells that story).

The effect was that his blood glucose levels reduced to 1.4 at one stage and the insulin levels from the blood screen that was taken were high (160  mU/l &#8211; that is more than 16 times the level of 9.7 mU/l suggested for the 24</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt"> July following the more limited blood screening (&#8216;assay&#8217;).</span></p>

In doing so I have been able to draw from a statement that the mother prepared with the obvious help of her solicitor, Ms Mary Richardson. That statement must have taken days to prepare. Mr Goodwin QC said that it was the best drafted statement that he had encountered in public law proceedings. I share that view. For Ms Richardson to have dedicated that amount of time, commitment and care to the preparation of a statement in a legally aided case speaks clearly of the quality of service that she provides. I spent a day reading the statement and placing its main contents into the chronological account that I have built up of all of the evidence during the currency of this hearing. </span></p>

Given the findings that I am making in this judgment, it is correct to say that I have found that the mother gave evidence that was, at times, unreliable and untruthful. When giving oral evidence she was deeply distressed and had panic attacks. There were frequent breaks and by the afternoon on each day it was not possible to continue. She was very well supported by her legal team, one of whom sat with her at the witness desk in court. Having observed her for that amount of time and having read so much about her, I am left in no doubt that her panic attacks were genuine. They signalled the level of genuine distress and fear that she was feeling about the issues that were being addressed and which no end of special measures could mitigate. </span></p>

Being woken up every two hours for weeks on end is horrible, but aside from being tearful through sheer exhaustion, I never complained because I believed what I was doing was in the best interest of my son, who I love so much. I didn&#8217;t like being in hospital, in truth I hated it, but it had to be me with AB, as my mum worked, so could only help on the odd day here and there. The Father had work too so wasn&#8217;t able to help. I didn&#8217;t want to leave AB alone, so it would be me at the hospital, day and night helping with his care and making sure he was ok. I would sleep on a small pull-out bed next to him, on a noisy ward. It was noisy all of the time, even through the night. The nurses were loud, machines would be beeping, doors opening and shutting. It was awful.&#8217;</span></p>

If AB was having a simple meal, sausage and waffle as he would have regularly&#8230;that was fine. However, it was more tricky when there were things like spaghetti and, for instance, you only had half a jar of Bolognese sauce and you then have to calculate it and I struggled with that.

Understanding the issues mother has with numbers would be important in this respect particularly her ability to adequately dial up/draw up insulin doses. Excess insulin administration could result from inaccurate carbohydrate counting where the meal carbohydrate content is overestimated, and consequently excess insulin is administered. This is harder to invoke as the cause of the July hypoglycaemic episodes which took place late evening and after the insulin infusion was switched off. There is the possibility that these episodes resulted from a bolus from an intravenous flush given at the end of the insulin sliding scale infusion (12). The Hospital has made the following comment. &#8220;It is the expectation that once an infusion stops, it is disconnected, and the cannula is flushed. Upon review of the documentation, we are unable to confirm with any certainty that this was done and therefore we cannot answer this question.&#8221; As argued earlier (page 12) this bolus alone would not explain the prolonged nature of the hypoglycaemia nor the plasma insulin concentrations of 9.7 and 160 mU/l that were detected. These values imply that additional exogenous insulin would need to have been administered.&#8217;</span></p>

It is not just simply about the ability of the parent to undertake multiplication etc it is also about a parent&#8217;s ability to put numbers into a machine. If there is a dose that has been offered, you have to be able to calculate that it is an appropriate dose &#8211; the pump system has its own calculator and it will work out a correction ratio but you have to recognise that number, produced by the machine, as being correct. The calculation would be a button push on the pump but, on a pen, you would then have to change the dial and  have to round the figures up or down due to increments on the system &#8211; if you had 3.25 units you then have to decide whether it is 3 or 3.5.

My assessment was the mother was able to understand diabetes management and to use what she had been taught to control the diabetes. As to the mother&#8217;s ability to calculate the treatment, I am unable to answer that question. We did discuss activities and foods and her answers seemed appropriate.&#8217;</span></p>

On 14th September 2021 I suffered a massive panic attack shortly before the ICPC and was not able to attend as a result. Back home, I took too many sleeping pills that had been prescribed around that time because I couldn&#8217;t sleep and was constantly up in the night over thinking about everything. After I had been arrested I had gone downhill. I said I couldn&#8217;t go into the ICPC so my dad dropped me home. I didn&#8217;t think about what I was doing when I took them; I just felt so blank and empty. I don&#8217;t really remember much but my brother found me and called the ambulance. I was taken to hospital and discharged later that day after seeing a mental health nurse. I have since sought counselling and had an assessment with Vitamind but they said they weren&#8217;t the right service for me, so I was referred onto Woman&#8217;s Aid and am waiting for an assessment with them. Vitamind said what they thought I needed was for someone to sit and listen to me. I am currently on Mirtazapine to help with my anxiety and depression; my mum handles my medication and I am not allowed access to it. My GP is aware of what happened and said there will be a review.

The LibreView charts &#8216;grey out&#8217; readings between 3.9 and 10 to signify that this is the normal bracket for readings. Professor Hindmarsh said that 12 mmol/l is a definite action point. The matter that I wish to emphasise, however, is that it only takes a drop of e.g. 2 mmol/l below the 4 mmol/l point for a child to be in real difficulty (see the glossary). Readings that exceed the upper limit (I will use 12) are not so dramatic. So, a reading of 14, although high, is not going to have the same impact as a reading that is 2 mmol/l below the lower limit of 4.  A brief look at the Diasend etc bundle shows that.  There are times when AB&#8217;s hyperglycaemia has been at the level of 27.8 mmol/l &#8211; 15.8 mmol/l higher than the upper action point of 12. </span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.03in"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">It is necessary to differentiate between endogenous and exogenous insulin. Endogenous insulin is the type produced by the body. Exogenous insulin is insulin that is administered.  Endogenous insulin will contain C-peptide. C-peptide interconnects the A and B chains of the insulin structure (as depicted at C63). Exogenous (i.e. administered) insulin will not contain C-peptide. Some &#8216;assays&#8217; (i.e. blood screens tests) can determine C-peptide presence; others cannot. If an assay is of a type that can identify C-peptide and insulin, but no C-peptide is found, it means that the insulin must be exogenous &#8211; that is, must have been administered. Professor Hindmarsh says at E63: &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">Biosynthetic human insulins, made by recombinant DNA technology, only contain the A and B chain. Some assays that measure insulin in the circulation can detect biosynthetic human insulin because there is cross reactivity in the actual measurement system (the Mercodia assay in Guildford). Some assay systems cannot do this, as there is no actual cross reactivity (Roche assay in [the local area]. The different performance of assays is helpful, therefore, because it allows differentiation to be made between exogenous and endogenous insulin production. In a situation of endogenous insulin production, both C-Peptide and insulin will be measurable, whereas if only exogenous insulin is present, C-Peptide will not be detectable because endogenous insulin production is switched off and insulin measured depending on the assay used. In Type 1 diabetes mellitus C-peptide is less helpful other than describing whether there is still some beta cell function as beta cells are destroyed by the disease process so we would expect C-peptide to gradually become unmeasurable with time.&#8217;</span></p>

Smart blood glucose meters can be used to assist with this calculation and apply correction doses to help bring any high blood glucose concentration back into the target range. For multiple injection therapy this would mean correcting all blood glucose measures above 10 mmol/l. There are several issues that need to be borne in mind. First, when dosing for food, the short-acting insulin needs to be given 15-20 minutes before food is consumed to match the insulin delivered from the injection to the sudden increase in blood glucose that results from food intake. In young children like AB, this can be difficult as the child may not eat all the food before them which means that there is now a mismatch between what insulin was expected to be needed with what is needed now that less carbohydrate has been taken in. Hypoglycaemia can therefore result 2-3 hours afterwards. One way around this, often used by families, is to bolus after the food has been consumed so that the dose can be matched </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">[the word &#8216;bolus&#8217; is defined in the glossary]</span></p>

If correction doses are given less than 2-3 hourly, then insulin from the second dose will stack on the previous one and this will lead to high plasma insulin concentrations which will have the effect of rapidly reducing the blood glucose. Third, any exercise undertaken will impact on the blood glucose tending generally to reduce it so this would also need to be considered and dosing adjusted downwards if exercise is likely 2 hours after a meal. Exercise would be less of an issue within the confines of the hospital admissions.</span></p>

For an average 6 year old the initial starting total daily dose might be 12.5 Units which would generate a carbohydrate ratio of 1 Unit of insulin for every 20 grams of carbohydrate. For a breakfast containing say 25 grams then the amount of insulin required is 1.25 Units, but the pen can only give either 1.0 or 1.5 Units meaning either you under or over administer. Similarly, the correction ratio would be 1 Unit of insulin will reduce the blood glucose by 10.5 mmol/l which means that 0.5 Units would reduce the blood glucose by 5.2 mmol/l.

The Hospital confirms that &#8220;An insulin cartridge is used in an insulin pen.&#8221; They go on to state &#8220;If insulin in a vial is prescribed (for example in patients who require an insulin infusion), the nurses use an insulin syringe which only draws up in units. When this patient was prescribed a type of insulin that did not come in a cartridge, in this case only, the insulin was drawn up and administered using an insulin syringe from a vial.&#8221; This has been clarified further by the Hospital. &#8220;We can confirm that the insulin was not taken from a cartridge with an insulin needle. The cartridge was in an insulin pen and the pen was used to administer insulin. When the drug chart has vials ticked it was because AB was on an insulin infusion and then the insulin was drawn up with an insulin syringe and put into a bigger syringe and diluted as per infusion guidelines.&#8221; This is important clarification because drawing up small doses using an insulin syringe from a vial can be inaccurate. Based on this clarification, we can discount inaccuracies in drawing up insulin for administration as a cause for the hypoglycaemic episodes.</span></p>

It would be unusual for this to get to the level of unconsciousness but may be in high 2&#8217;s&#8230; Exercise can be a factor that leads to fluctuation.  Pen accuracy is a problem &#8211; this is a mechanical issue with the device. When you get down to e.g. 0.5 the error on what can be delivered can be anything up to about 5%. That may not matter for an adolescent or adult, but when you get down to a child of AB&#8217;s age, that can be an important amount. Insulin dosing probably accounts for the problems in March; there had been a readjustment of his dosing and that was associated with hypos. Understanding numbers and decimal points is quite important. There has to be accuracy of carb counting.  The more glucose that is in food, the more insulin you are likely to require. He would have needed one unit of insulin to 15 gms of carbohydrate. You have to be a bit circumspect with pens since the lowest you can give is 0.5 units.

Conversely, dehydration or lack of exercise in the heat may lead to increased blood sugar levels.  Therefore, there is also the risk of high blood glucose levels. High summer temperatures can make diabetes harder to control. Once 25C is reached, we would suggest lowering the insulin dose otherwise you might go too low.</span></p>

Humulin S could be given either via a pen or a syringe and needle. I had been told by the hospital staff previously that Humulin S is an old-fashioned type of insulin and requires a much thicker pen to inject the insulin. The type of pen required is unusual and not readily available; the hospital team had spent some time trying to find me a pen and said we were lucky that they had managed to find one. I was given one Humulin S pen to take home by the hospital and gave that one pen in my possession back to the hospital on 22nd July 2021 as per the hospital protocol. If the type of insulin identified in AB&#8217;s blood on 28th July 2021 could be narrowed down to Humulin S, then it would have been impossible for me to have been in a position where I could have injected it using the pen. Humulin S cartridges only fit in the Humulin S pen and as explained, I did not have one of those in my possession. I accept however, that I could have injected Humulin S by drawing up Humulin S from a vial using a syringe and needle. However, the difference between using a pen and a syringe and needle is that the latter was much more painful for AB and he hated being injected with a needle. You would have to count to ten with him to prepare him properly; if I had tried to inject him discretely and not given him any warning, he would have shouted out.

AB spent a significant amount of time between March and August 2021 in the hospital that impacted his ability to attend school. AB continued to have dangerously low blood glucose levels despite being on extremely small doses of insulin or no insulin. Mild hypoglycaemia is common in insulin-treated children with diabetes and is managed simply at home with oral glucose. AB&#8217;s episodes of hypoglycaemia unusually required multiple treatments with oral glucose, a glucagon injection (glucagon is a hormone that counters the effect of insulin and raises blood glucose levels) and repeated intravenous injections of glucose over several hours in order to correct and maintain a safe blood glucose (more than 4 mmol/L). The severe hypoglycaemic episodes continued despite changes in the types of insulin.</span></p>

There are no accompanying hypoglycaemic screen measures so it is not possible to comment further. On the evening of the 28th July 2021 the intravenous insulin infusion was stopped at 20.38. By 22.00 the blood glucose had fallen to 1.4 mmol/l. The hypoglycaemia screen showed a plasma insulin concentration of 160 mU/l. This value is higher than that estimated from the infusion rate and in addition it would be expected that the plasma insulin concentration would be below 2 mU/l 28 minutes after the insulin infusion was switched off even if an intravenous bolus (flush) of insulin was inadvertently given. Both these observations imply that additional exogenous insulin was present throughout this period and as this was not prescribed, must have been administered by person or persons unknown.</span></p>

Finger prick point of care blood glucose testing is of whole blood whereas the laboratory measures glucose in the plasma component of blood. </span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt;color:#252525">Plasma has a higher water content than whole blood, so there is more dissolved glucose in plasma compared with whole blood, and readings are 11 to 15 percent higher. New blood glucose meters now report blood glucose as &#8220;plasma glucose&#8221; to conform with lab readings by adjusting for the water content. Further, there can be discrepancies between meters depending what system they use to measure glucose and home meters need to be calibrated from time to time to ensure accuracy [E53].</span></p>

Insulin is the only hormone that can reduce blood glucose concentrations. Endogenous insulin secretion is switched off when the blood glucose concentration reaches 4.4 mmol/l and the counter-regulatory hormones, glucagon, adrenaline, cortisol, and growth hormone, which raise blood glucose, are secreted when the blood glucose reaches 3.8, 3.8, 3.7 and 3.2 mmol/l respectively. Of these, glucagon and adrenaline are the first line of defence acting within minutes whereas growth hormone and cortisol act over several hours. In Type 1 diabetes mellitus there is no insulin produced by the pancreas so this cannot be switched off. Glucagon secretion is also compromised in this situation because of the loss of insulin production from the beta cells. This leaves adrenaline as the first line along with growth hormone and cortisol. The thresholds for release are also reduced in Type 1 diabetes mellitus especially where there is recurrent hypoglycaemia (Table 3) (8). Not only are the thresholds lower but the magnitude of the counter-regulatory response is reduced [E62].</span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.03in"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">Human insulin, made in the beta cells of the pancreas, starts life as a large molecule known as proinsulin. The A and B chains are linked together by disulphide bridges and the C-Peptide component links the A and B chains initially. The C-Peptide is then cleaved from the proinsulin molecule and is secreted in equimolar concentrations with the insulin molecule. Insulin is cleared rapidly, predominantly by the liver, and has a half-life in the circulation of 4 minutes. Half-life is the time taken for a 50% reduction in the concentration or amount of a drug or a hormone in the blood to take place. C-Peptide is cleared by the kidney and has a longer half-life of some 20 to 30 minutes. This means that, in the circulation at any time, the circulating concentration of C-Peptide is greater than insulin by a factor of 5 to 10. The advantage of the C-Peptide measurement is that it is indicative of insulin secretion from the beta cells of the pancreas. Biosynthetic human insulins, made by recombinant DNA technology, only contain the A and B chain. Some assays that measure insulin in the circulation can detect biosynthetic human insulin because there is cross-reactivity in the actual measurement system (the Mercodia assay in Guildford). Some assay systems cannot do this, as there is no actual cross-reactivity (Roche assay in [local area]). The different performance of assays is helpful, therefore, because it allows differentiation to be made between exogenous and endogenous insulin production. In a situation of endogenous insulin production, both C-Peptide and insulin will be measurable, whereas if only exogenous insulin is present, C-Peptide will not be detectable because endogenous insulin production is switched off and insulin measured depending on the assay used. In Type 1 diabetes mellitus C-Peptide is less helpful other than describing whether there is still some beta cell function as beta cells are destroyed by the disease process so we would expect C-Peptide to gradually become unmeasurable with time.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.89in;margin-right:0.03in"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">Hypoglycaemia in diabetes is typically the result of the interplay of relative or absolute therapeutic insulin excess and compromised defences against falling plasma glucose concentrations. The latter have been outlined already but consist of reduced/absent glucagon response to hypoglycaemia along with an attenuated adrenaline response along with absent/reduced clinical responses to hypoglycaemia. This is also known as hypoglycaemia-associated autonomic failure. The pivotal finding is that a 2-hour episode of hypoglycaemia in the afternoon can reduce the hypoglycaemic responses to hypoglycaemia the following morning in non-diabetic individuals and in those with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. The observations have been extended to include reduced responses to hypoglycaemia during sleep as well as the impact of antecedent exercise which reduces the adrenaline response. Figure 3 summarises broader risk factors for hypoglycaemia in Type 1 diabetes mellitus.</span></p>

Later in the afternoon he scribbled all over one of the girl's pictures with no reason.

The actual readings were: 04.02.2021 (61 mmol/l) and 20.05.2021 (84 mmol/l). The reading for February 2021 (slightly high but not much) is consistent with the evidence that up to the end of February 2021 the mother was managing AB&#8217;s diabetic care (and, therefore, that the training had had an impact).

There, the mother tells the partner that AB&#8217;s blood glucose levels are 15.9 and he is drenched in sweat.

There is an exchange about the doctor and the fact that, it is said, the antibiotic had sugar in it. At 21:55 the mother said that the doctor had rung back and had said &#8216;just leave it&#8217; and that the mother should ring back if his blood glucose levels went higher.

AB&#8217;s levels were high and were increasing at 21:00 hrs. It was getting late at night. The blood glucose levels were well beyond the action point of 12. It is entirely understandable that the mother would not want to ring back later and was tired. She had been trained in how to give correction doses. There is no professional support for any criticism of her relating to that night. Any suggestion that this shows a tendency of the mother&#8217;s to &#8216;go it alone&#8217; when deciding to treat his diabetes is without any merit. It is not even known whether the correction dose was given. AB&#8217;s blood glucose levels reduced gradually at about this time so that it reached about 10 by 5 o&#8217;clock next morning. The language used by the mother is the sort of language that people do use in private text exchanges. Where the 32 reading came from in the GP&#8217;s notes, I do not know; it could relate to the &#8216;off the scale&#8217; reading of 27.8.</span></p>

Counsel for the mother referred me to authority which I have considered. However, I am not sure that it does require authority to identify the need for care when reviewing text messages that are sent in the expectation that they will not be seen by anyone other than the intended recipient. Further, it is simply wrong to treat words in a text exchange as if they were chosen with precision and full, dictionary-based meaning.</span></p>

I advised I was unhappy with this and called Dr G directly. Discussed and advised I would give no more than 2 units Lantus maybe only 1.5 units. Advised tea eaten with no insulin cover but that I would call to review. Dr G advised he needed an admission Called mum to update and she was happy with this and will attend ED in the next hour. I have asked her to download the meter before she leaves. She can access it with her password. Plan from Dr G is to give 1.5 units Lantus tonight and 1:50g with breakfast tomorrow. PDSN to pick up in the morning. Congratulated mum on an amazing job overnight and today. Reassured her that this is unusual hence the review/admission to ED.&#8217;</span></p>

Shortly after this AB presented with hypoglycaemia and this was recorded on both the Libre glucose sensor system and by blood glucose testing. Hypoglycaemia can be encountered at times during the first year following diagnosis. This usually results from ongoing insulin release from the remaining beta cells of the pancreas in response to high blood glucose. This endogenous release summates with any exogenous insulin administered leading to a greater glucose reducing effect than might be anticipated. There was certainly evidence of ongoing insulin action in terms of suppression of plasma fatty acids and 3-betahydroxybutyrate concentrations. Insulin had to be discontinued for periods of time which can occur during this phase of the disease process. The hypoglycaemia screens were unhelpful in terms of helping understand the cause.

His test showed normal cortisol. AB had his C-Peptide levels checked in his blood. The C-Peptide levels indicate the inherent insulin reserve in the body.

The type of insulin prescribed was changed to Novorapid. The data from the Medtronic insulin pump shows exactly what insulin AB received via the pump from 27th April to 6th May 2021, what carbs he had, what correction doses were given and what his blood glucose levels were [I2490 to I2509] [I2846]. In the days leading up to his next admission, I felt like I was managing the pump quite well as his levels were either in range or quite high. I spoke to Nurse T from the diabetes team who helped me work out new carb ratios in an attempt to bring his levels down [I4357]. There were also a few occasions when he wet himself but Nurse T advised to speak to the GP if that continued to occur and get a urine test carried out.&#8217;</span></p>

The Mother would quite often ask me about how to work the numbers out and I would explain it to her. It was a lot for her because it was changing all the time.

An insulin pump can be very useful in accurately delivering very small doses of insulin. On both occasions when AB was receiving insulin via an insulin pump, he experienced persistent raised blood glucose levels along with raised blood ketone levels which together indicated inadequate insulin delivery. No fault was found with AB&#8217;s insulin pump on either occasion when checked. Inadequate insulin delivery by his insulin pump continued whilst AB was a hospital inpatient. A sixfold increase in daily dose of insulin during insulin pump therapy failed to correct high blood glucose levels and as a result, AB was switched to an intravenous insulin infusion with rapid improvement in blood glucose and blood ketone levels. It is very difficult to explain the persistently raised blood glucose levels during insulin pump therapy despite much larger doses of insulin being administered. Careful observation did not identify any interference with insulin delivery from the insulin pump and these episodes therefore remain unexplained.&#8217;</span></p>

The mother did not seek emergency medical assistance for him. For reasons that I set out, I reach two conclusions about this day. First, the very fact that AB&#8217;s blood glucose levels dropped to 1.3 signals that his blood glucose levels were not being adequately managed. Of course heat and exercise can affect them. However, they are factors that affect every diabetic child and were known to this mother, who was AB&#8217;s primary carer. It is pure chance that the events of that day did not result in more serious and permanent consequences for AB. Second, given the extent of his collapse, the mother should have sought immediate medical aid. I accept that AB&#8217;s condition improved quickly and the mother consulted her own mother about it. I note that, on 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond">st</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt"> July 2021 when there was another emergency, it took an ambulance two hours to arrive, but that does not explain the mother&#8217;s approach to this medical emergency.

J said that a passer-by had given him some water and they had splashed it on his face to try and revive him.</span></p>

I would describe him as being a bit disorientated although responsive and he said he felt sick. I checked his bloods at 2:24pm (according to the Diasend finger prick log) and he was hypo with a reading of 2.3. I treated the hypo by giving him jelly babies from recollection (although I might have given him Glucogel, I can&#8217;t remember). I exhibit a photograph taken of AB taken at 2.26pm which I took as I thought he looked grey, and I planned on showing it to the diabetes team (EXH/BR/2).</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">AB&#8217;s levels came up quite quickly and after 30 minutes he just wanted to play again.

I tried to keep him snacked up, every hour, with digestive biscuits but sometimes he was refusing to eat a biscuit, so I would give him crisps instead. I didn&#8217;t take him to A &amp; E on the 13th June 2021, as he came up quickly and seemed fine in himself. It was a Sunday too, so the diabetes clinic wouldn&#8217;t have been open and the alternative would have been to go to A &amp; E, which didn&#8217;t seem necessary given that he was fine once I had treated the hypo</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">&#8217;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">.</span></p>

Given that I have not heard from the brother and the mother&#8217;s evidence was truncated, I am not able to reach a definite conclusion about whether the brother did take AB for a bike ride but, on balance, I think that he did take AB on the ride and the mother was not present at that stage. If he did, and AB went out for exercise on a hot day with someone who was not trained in diabetes, did not have any equipment to deal with it, did not deal with it other than carrying AB home and did not have his phone with him, that all adds to the lack of care that was shown to AB that day. </span></p>

The LibreView readings are informative. They are at DM-I963. They show that AB was scanned (the white circles on the chart) at about 10:30 a.m. and was slightly hypoglycaemic (3.8 and 3.7). They show an increase in his levels at lunchtime (as would be expected). They then show his blood glucose levels dropping with a scan at about 13:15 registering a reading of 9.2 and then a reading of 2.9 at about 14:15. There is then a scan at about 15:30 hrs which registers 12.6 and another scan at 16:15 which shows a reading of 3.6.

At 1.3 mmol/l AB would have been very seriously unwell and that reading would mean that there is every reason to think that he would have been unconscious.

It is possible that AB&#8217;s insulin was not delivered early enough before his lunch. It is possible that he was given an additional shot of insulin before he went out on the ride and that led to stacking. It is possible that carb counting was wrong that day. However, given the state of the evidence and, recollecting the direction that I must not go further in findings than the evidence permits, I cannot determine what led to this beyond the fact that it resulted from a lack of care and that lack of care caused him significant harm (i.e. unconsciousness and the risk of worse).</span></p>

AB having multiple hypos. Mum describes these as moderate to severe. On Sunday 13th June AB was found laying on the sofa and Mum could not rouse him for approx. 60 seconds. His eyes were rolling. Mum shouted/shook him and he was then rousable enough to eat jelly babies. His BG was 1.3mmol at this time and continued to be low for some hours after. On Monday 14th June AB woke at 10.8 but was hypo at 3.8 on arrival at school. Mum reports his eyes were rolling back and he was lethargic but did consume jelly babies which took him up to 9.2, Shortly afterwards he was 3.8mmol again and had further mild hypos that evening. Today he woke at 9.7 but was 2.7 on arrival to school. Mum describes AB as not being rousable for some time with eyes rolling and slumped on mums shoulder. He then 'woke up' and was able to have some jelly babies. Discussed with Mum the use of glucogel and told her to keep on her at all times. Also discussed calling 999 if she is not able to rouse AB. Mum mentioned a few times that she didn&#8217;t want to be admitted to hospital and I have some concerns she is a managing AB at home during times when she might need to come to hospital due to fear of being admitted. I discussed this with Mum and asked that any time she can't wake AB, she must call 999 immediately. T call to school to clarify events that mum describes. Spoke with Mrs W who works in school office and was with AB and Mum during the hypos today and yesterday morning. She reports slightly different events than Mum. According to Mrs W, Mum walked through the gates yesterday saying AB had a BG level of 1.0. She appeared panicked and told staff she had already given him a sweet. G said he looked pale but was not asleep/unrousable. Mum told school staff that he had had a really bad hypo on Sunday and she couldn't wake him so she threw water on him. This morning on walking into school Mum told school staff that his levels were ok. School staff asked Mum to recheck and stay until this had been done. G reports that his level was 2 and he was acting quite 'peculiar' which G thought was mainly behavioural. She did not see him asleep/lethargic or eyes rolling. G report's mum was saying to AB "stay with me, stay with me" which she felt was unnecessary given how AB was looking but did state that she is not a nurse and could have mis-read what was happening. School are really concerned about having AB back. They feel his diabetes is not currently managed well enough for him to safely attend. I discussed with them that it would be totally normal for someone with type 1 diabetes to have 3-5 hypos a week and for these to be easily treated and for the child to be able to stay in school during this. I did agree that currently AB&#8217;s diabetes is very difficult to manage and that I will discuss this with his PDSN and consultant to see how we can better support AB and school. G wanted to know if AB will be back to school tomorrow and reported to feeling nervous about this. I thought that perhaps given he has had three days of potentially severe hypos he would be feeling tired and run down and that it would be good for him to recuperate at home tomorrow. Will call Mum to discuss.&#8217;</span></p>

Following this, his subcutaneous Insulin was stopped and then a decision was made to try to deliver insulin via an insulin pump containing Humulin S. AB was commenced on an insulin pump again on 22nd June 2021.

There are unexplained hypos with no detectable insulin. The concerns are that blood sugars are dropping from 15 to 2.2 on a fairly constant basis. The hypos resolve but then he returns with the same story. During the last few days in hospital, his blood sugars have been on the higher side. There have been lots of changes to medication, but the requests or instructions to mum are fairly complex and there are no concerns regarding mum&#8217;s level of understanding. Mum is fully engaging with appointments and is always available for telephone calls and answers appropriately. There is no community paediatrician currently involved with the family as a previous referral from their GP was rejected. Community paediatrics would be able to liaise with school and mum. School have witnessed AB going low quickly, usually at the beginning of the day and are concerned. School have previously had appropriate training.

It had been agreed with the diabetes team that for a half hour window each day, he could be off the pump so that he could go swimming. On some days, he was off the pump for longer as he was having such a good time, going in and out of the sea. I noticed how his ketones would rise very quickly during those times that he wasn&#8217;t receiving any insulin. As he was high already, it would happen at a surprisingly quick rate. I spoke to the diabetes team almost every day and sent them the pump data and Freestyle Libre data most days as requested.

The Mother would get upset as she just wanted AB to have a really nice, normal time. She was constantly checking his levels. AB had a croupy cough whilst on holiday and ended up spending a day in the caravan as he was unwell. I presume that would have contributed to his levels.  The Mother had bought AB a special diabetic cake for him as it was his birthday, but he didn&#8217;t like it. It didn&#8217;t taste very nice. He didn&#8217;t have a &#8220;treat treat&#8221; on holiday because his levels were so high.

This, once again signals to me that, despite the closeness of this family, there are aspects of the mother&#8217;s life and behaviour of which her parents are unaware; perhaps that would be hardly surprising for a mother in her 20&#8217;s in relation to an issue that was not of such importance. The pump was central to AB&#8217;s care at the time and I am surprised that the family, as a whole, was not aware of how and when it was being used.</span></p>

These charts show figures that are consistently high, at times, well off the scale. There is an obvious problem with the amount of insulin that is being delivered. We would only advise that you can go for a whole hour off the pump as long as there are checks. One of the striking things here is that, overnight, you would expect the BGL to be in range but it was not. With readings in the mid 20&#8217;s, AB would have been irritable, seeking out drinks and experiencing hunger pain. There would be high levels of glucose in his blood but it would not be getting into cells. His ketone levels on 2nd July are worrying&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">.

If you know that your child is seriously and repeatedly hyperglycaemic, you should not take the child off the pump, certainly for more than 30 minutes. The very point of the pump is to deliver insulin. Insulin reduces blood glucose levels. Further, if your child does have croup (a &#8216;barking cough often associated with breathlessness&#8217;) as AB did on that holiday later on in the week): a) you do not take the child off the pump at a time when he is hyperglycaemic and suffering from an illness that, of itself, may cause his levels to rise and b) you do not allow the child to go swimming. Further, in relation to a diabetic child who is hyperglycaemic and suffering from intercurrent illness, you regulate his diet very carefully. Of course, croup is a common childhood illness and a parent of a diabetic child has to be able to manage the child&#8217;s blood glucose levels when the child has common illnesses (e.g. colds) and when the child engages in everyday types of exercise. </span></p>

But mere contact with the team did and could not of itself regulate his blood glucose levels. The problems with hyperglycaemia were not of the team&#8217;s making. Further, whatever may be said about the level of contact, the fact is that his blood glucose levels were not managed adequately during this holiday. Taking him off the pump (as the mother says that she did for more than 30 minutes) to let him go into the sea may well have been part of the reason for the pattern of his blood glucose levels that week.</span></p>

Whilst perhaps understandable, the impact cannot be understated. AB was placed in a very precarious position. By Friday 2 July, his ketones reached 2.3. There was not a single day during the holiday when he was not hyperglycaemic, often for a prolonged period of time. The mother agreed in cross-examination that if AB&#8217;s diabetes is not under control that that constitutes a real concern.

It does include that it was the nursing team who noticed that the mother had over-ridden the pump (rather than the mother telling them that she was doing so).  In oral evidence Nurse G said that she had not documented the mother&#8217;s reasoning for over-riding the pump but, she said, it seemed reasonable that the mother had done so. There are times when it is appropriate to over-ride the pump, Nurse G said. She thought that the explanation that the mother gave her was &#8216;plausible&#8217; but felt that the team needed to keep a close eye on the over-rides. In re-examination she said that there was no scrutiny of the over-ride but the mother&#8217;s suggestion of a 130% increase for an hour seemed reasonable to her. In her evidence the mother said that she accepted that she had over-ridden the pump without consulting the diabetes team first.</span></p>

I do think that she should have consulted the team first, but nothing turns on that point. The point, to my mind, is that AB&#8217;s blood glucose levels were not managed properly during this holiday. The very fact that the mother needed to over-ride the pump in an attempt to bring his blood glucose levels down suggests to me that his levels were not being controlled properly. It is not possible to say what the mother was doing for this to happen. I suspect that it is a combination of him being off the pump for too long, his diet being inadequately controlled, croup and possibly heat and excitement. Those are all things with which a reasonable parent (using section 31 language) should be expected to cope in relation to a diabetic child. This mother did not. I do not accept the oral evidence that she gave that she did not find it stressful managing his diabetes during this holiday. </span></p>

I very much doubt that AB was unconscious that day. His blood glucose levels increased immediately after the 3.1 reading and remained, for the most part, in the grey zone [DM-J1006]. In fact, this was a relatively stable day as shown in that chart. I accept that he may have been tired and mildly hypoglycaemic after playing on the beach. On this occasion, I do not see any reason for the mother to have taken him to hospital or to have summonsed an ambulance (in any event, she was in a car herself and could have driven him to hospital more quickly if necessary). I can only imagine that, with the readings at DM-J1006, if he had turned up at A and E they would have asked &#8216;what are you doing here?&#8217; By the time that he arrived at hospital and was seen by anyone, his levels would have been normal (as shown on the chart). Whatever did happen on the journey back from Brean, it appears that he picked up for the rest of the day. I suspect that mother was exaggerating the text to A but I do not consider that has any relevance to the issues before me. </span></p>

During the hot period, he was less interested in eating lunch hence why he had to have so many snacks.

This is the time that the mother is referring to at C189 of para 146 when the mother says that she was giving him foods that were not good for him. ..That increases blood flow which promotes more rapid absorption of insulin from the injection sites. So, you can end up in a situation where you might not have an issue but then you go low because of the easy uptake of insulin in the hot weather. Magnum ice creams, crisp and chocolate bars have a high fat content which will slow down glucose absorption so you would not use them to raise the levels.&#8217;</span></p>

In that situation &#8220;you can end up in a situation where you would not normally have any particular issue but on a hot day you might find you go low because of the easy uptake of insulin in hot weather&#8221;.  One cause for the relatively flat line on 18 July 2021 could be &#8220;over-estimation of carbs&#8221; (XX by M).  Magnums, crisps and chocolate bars might also have an effect - the relatively high fat to glucose ratio in ice-cream &#8220;smooths the absorption profile&#8221; of the glucose per Professor Hindmarsh.   He emphasised that he had reached no adverse conclusions about the mother&#8217;s diabetes management that day and did not criticise the timing of her call to the nurses the following day: indeed he was sympathetic with her efforts &#8211; &#8220;it looked as if it was a very difficult situation they were in.  She tried a number of options, not the best, but what she had available and obviously it was quite difficult to rectify the situation&#8221; (XX by M).  That response, from the Chair of the Medical Safety Committee at UCH, hardly smacks of mismanagement.&#8217;</span></p>

Professor Hindmarsh explained that although there were a number of low blood sugar readings, the cumulative hypos may have made AB less symptomatic.

The Libre records showed a large number of hypo episodes that day i.e. the mother&#8217;s account to the paramedics of 15 hypos a day was supported by the data. In her statement the mother describes AB as &#8220;hypo and drowsy and not accepting glucose treatment&#8230;clammy but breathing normally&#8221; [C190].  As described accurately in her oral evidence, she dialled 999 at 21.20, 22.01 and 22.15 [EM E46].  In the 999 call AB is described as &#8216;in hypo and refusing all treatment&#8217; [SB E34].

His blood glucose were as low as 1.9 mmol/L which required 3 boluses of 10% dextrose, continuous intravenous glucose infusion (10%), intramuscular glucagon (glucagon is a hormone that counter-regulates the effect of Insulin by increasing the blood glucose levels). AB required a concentrated form of glucose solutions (12.5%) to maintain his blood sugars at a safe level. Prior to the admission to the emergency department, AB was reported to have received only 0.5 units of his insulin in the evening. Due to the significant nature of hypoglycaemia AB's injections were once again stopped and it was replaced by sliding scale (continuous intravenous infusion of insulin which is adjusted depending on his blood glucose levels).&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt"> The sliding scale insulin was Actrapid (see the glossary).</span></p>

The assumptions that I have made is that there are no insulin antibodies present that would alter the removal of insulin or prolong its presence in the circulation. This would appear reasonable as there were no insulin antibodies present when measured. The degree of renal impairment is insufficient to alter insulin dynamics and there is no evidence of liver failure which would also prolong insulin metabolism.&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">  The argument goes, therefore, that, since there was 9.7 mU/l of detectable insulin when there should have been none, there must have been insulin administered to AB.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">However, if the pump switch off was later, the figures alter. If there was a flush of the cannula and the cannula was used for the blood screen, the figures alter further. If the flush was performed after the pump was turned off and not contemporaneously with it (or before) then the figures alter further.  There is no clear evidence of how the screen was taken. Nurse CD said: &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">I don&#8217;t remember if the blood was taken through the cannula or separately. Good practice means that a sample should not be taken from the cannula but I do not have any evidence of how it was taken that night&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">.  Therefore, if it was taken from the cannula it could have been contaminated by an insulin flush; since the insulin identified in the blood screen is so small, that could obviously make a difference.</span></p>

I was also saying about the timing &#8211; we only have 39 minutes (1 &#8211; 1.39 a.m.) we are talking about a few minutes and the conclusions could alter. We don&#8217;t have the time when the pump was turned off from a pump print off. The time comes from the nursing log&#8230;The figures could have an error of 10%. The 01:15 hrs figure with a flush reduces down to 3.8. So, the stopping of the pump at 1.20 leading to a reading of about 7.6 would be sufficient to explain the reading of 9.7 on the sample. 7.6 is close enough to 9.7 to mean that it is not possible to exclude the pump stopping at 1.20 with a flush as the reason for the sample reading of 9.7 given the proximity of 9.7 to 7.6.  This analysis does not absolutely exclude the possibility of the pump being turned off between 1.15 and 1.20. If the flush was later than this, it could further distort the figures and mean that the figure of 9.7 would be further explicable. The right hand column on the above table assumes that the switch off and the flush occurred at the same time. If you take the pump switch off at 1.15 and then say the flush was at 1.20 this would mean that at 1.39 you would be much closer to the 9.7 reading</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">&#8217;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">. </span></p>

Further, I consider that it would only take a small amount of contamination at the time that the sample was taken to achieve a reading of 9.7 mU/l (e.g. drawing the sample from a site where there was a reserve of insulin through cannula defect). The passage of time between when the pump was switched off (whenever that might have been within the parameters that are suggested) and the taking of the blood screen is short (at most 39 minutes). </span></p>

This may relate to the practice of flushing the infusion line after discontinuation of the sliding scale insulin infusion. The deadspace that would be flushed was 0.45 ml made up of a 22G cannula deadspace of 0.16 ml and the nonreturn extension set of 0.29 ml (information from the Hospital). This would represent an intravenous bolus of 0.45 Units of insulin. The correct way to clear the line would be to infuse 0.9% sodium chloride at the same rate as the insulin infusion was at the time of discontinuation to clear the line. If the deadspace is 0.45 ml that would mean running the pump for an additional hour which was not the case. An intravenous bolus of insulin produces hypoglycaemia (blood glucose 2.6 mmol/l) 20 minutes after administration (assuming a normal blood glucose at commencement of the test) which usually normalises 60-90 minutes after insulin administration. In this case the flush would have delivered a bolus of 0.45 Units of insulin which would be a fifth of the dose that would have been administered if AB was having the IIHT test of 2.&#8217;</span></p>

It is on this date that, I find, the mother did administer insulin to AB covertly and wrongfully as alleged in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Local Authority schedule. The infusion pump was stopped that night at 20:38 hrs. A blood screen was taken at 22:20. The insulin measurement in the blood screen was 160 mU/l. The screen was analysed by a Professor T from Cologne in his report dated 30 September 2021 [E23]. The LibreView chart for the day is at DM-J1010 and it shows that AB was hyperglycaemic for most of the day and that, shortly before the pump was switched off his blood glucose levels began to reduce. They continued to fall until they reached about 4.6 at 21:00 hrs. By 22:00 hrs they had reduced to 1.4 mmol/l [I3864]; that is a very low and dangerous level that appears to have been measured by a finger-prick test. AB would obviously have been affected by having blood glucose levels such as that; he would be at significant risk of unconsciousness (see the glossary).</span></p>

Subsequent checks of the pump infusion system revealed no problems with the device. A further hypoglycaemia screen was undertaken at 22.20 and is shown in Table 1 [at E60]. The hypoglycaemia screen shows a normal plasma acyl carnitine with low plasma growth hormone and cortisol. It should be noted that the glycaemic threshold for counter-regulatory hormone release is lower in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus particularly in the face of recurrent hypoglycaemic episodes (Table 3) (8).</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">The lower values for growth hormone and cortisol probably reflect this alteration in threshold along with some evidence of blunted responses in the face of recurrent hypoglycaemia. The low growth hormone and cortisol are not the cause for the hypoglycaemic episodes as deficiencies of them are associated with the presence of raised ketones and fatty acids during hypoglycaemia whereas in this and the other hypoglycaemia screens the fatty acids and ketones were low/suppressed indicative of insulin action.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">The striking feature on this occasion was the high plasma insulin concentration of 160 mU/l. This was confirmed in the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guilford result of 850 pmol/l (141 mU/l) and 624 pmol/l (104 mU/l) in the PEG treated sample. PEG precipitation removes any effect of insulin antibodies (which were negative) on the assay. These insulin measurements are also like those obtained by Professor T in Cologne where human insulin (no synthetic insulins of the Novorapid, Glargine or Levemir types were detected) was measured at 7.1 ng/ml (174 mU/l). The C-peptide was low at 92 pmol/l (132 pmol/l in Professor Ts laboratory) confirming that there was little in the way of residual beta cell function in the pancreas. This implies that the insulin measured is exogenous which, of course, it would be in anyone with Type 1 diabetes where endogenous insulin production from the beta cells of the pancreas is destroyed by the underlying disease process. Exogenous administration of an oral hypoglycaemic agent was excluded by a negative screen for sulphonylureas, a class of oral hypoglycaemic drugs used to treat Type 2 diabetes mellitus.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">We know that the plasma insulin concentration was 160 mU/l at 22.20. The infusion rate of the pump system was 0.53 Units/hour before switching off at 20.38. Using the same pharmacology approach outlined above the steady state plasma insulin concentration would be 17 mU/l. There are three points to this. First this value is lower than that measured at 22.20. Second, we would expect the insulin from the steady state infusion to be close to zero 20-25 minutes after the insulin infusion was switched off. Third, if we factor in the effect of a bolus flush of insulin then this would have delivered in addition to the switch off noted above additional insulin.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">With a deadspace of 0.45 ml then the bolus would have been 0.45 Units or 450 mU. Applying the half-life calculations this would mean that the circulating insulin immediately following the bolus would be 225 mU/l (450 mU dissolved in a blood volume of 2 litres) at time zero or 20.38. With a half-life of 4 minutes then 28 minutes later (21.04) the plasma insulin remaining would be 1.76 mU/l which is below the detection limit of the assay. Even if we combine the bolus flush and the insulin from the steady state infusion (225 mU/l + 17 mU/l) we would start with a plasma insulin concentration of 242 mU/l which after 4 minutes would be 121 mU/l (already below the value detected at 22.20 and would be below the assay level of detection of 2 mU/l by 21.04.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">These three observations imply that there must have been additional exogenous insulin present throughout this period.

This is due to the cannula patency being reduced such that backpressure has caused fluid leakage further back. This is similar situation if the cannula becomes &#8220;tissued&#8221; in the surrounding subcutaneous tissue where the back pressure leads to flow of fluid and insulin outwards through the cannula insertion point. In my report I have considered insulin leaching from the plastic of the cannula contributing an additional 10-15% to the insulin delivered and this amount would not materially affect the calculations made. Once the syringe pump is switched off insulin is unlikely to move from the cannula space into the circulation as the pressure in the vein is greater than that in the cannula.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.03in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">I have also covered the practice of flushing the line which would cause a bolus of insulin to travel from the giving set and cannula into the blood stream and I have included the volume in my calculations. When undertaking blood sampling for a hypoglycaemia screen or indeed any blood test a venepuncture should be undertaken to obtain a free-flowing sample. Samples should not be taken from an intravenous cannula as this can be contaminated by the infusate in this case insulin. We have already noted that any dead space would be 0.45 ml which would contain 450 mU of insulin. If we assume that this was removed together with the blood sample which would probably have been 5 ml to undertake all the tests needed then the likely plasma insulin concentration that would be measured as a result would be 90 mU/l. It all depends whether this were done and if it were how much of the deadspace would have been cleared before the blood sample was drawn. Usually a 2 ml sample would be removed to clear the dead space and that 2ml sample discarded. To pursue this argument further the Hospital would need to provide information on how the hypoglycaemia screen samples were obtained with respect to independent venepuncture versus sampling from an indwelling catheter and in the case of the latter how much dead space would have been cleared</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">&#8217;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">.</span></p>

Some of this initial insulin action may relate to the effects of residual insulin from the pump although a duration of 2 hours is a long time for the intravenous insulin bolus proposed. After 22.00 and through the night there was evidence of ongoing insulin action on the Libre download until around 02.00 on the 29</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt"> July 2022. This would be consistent with ultra-short or short acting insulin action although it is always difficult to exclude an effect of long-acting insulin in these situations. Looking at Figure 1 the data would fit with ultra-short or short acting insulin best. When using the subcutaneous route we have to use a different half-life the plasma terminal half-life to account for the fact that insulin is absorbed from the subcutaneous site. The plasma terminal half-life of insulin is 120 minutes. If we accept the 160 mU/l as the peak at 22.00 then we would expect at 02.00 there to be 40 mU/l of insulin in the circulation so overall slightly higher than depicted at time point in Figure 1 where we would place the 160 mU/l peak at 60 minutes on the time x-axis and the 40 mU/l value would be attained at 300 minutes on the x-axis slightly above the 20 mU/l obtained in the study. Note that in Figure 1b this implies that insulin action would be virtually over by 300 minutes and certainly by 360 minutes which tallies with the Libre data and clinical observations out to 04.00. To attain a peak of 90 mU/l on Figure 1 a dose of 0.2 Units/kg body weight of Novorapid was used so to attain a level of 160 mU/l (dose response is linear at these levels) would require 0.36 Units/kg or for AB approximately 8-9 Units of Novorapid insulin.&#8217;</span></p>

I think that the measurements are valid. It is always useful to test out other options but I am reasonably certain that there was insulin present.

One is the pump system, the other would be a standard subcutaneous injection of Actrapid. Those are the two options available to us to explain the insulin concentration. You rightly dismissed the antibodies &#8211; that is out. That would be another explanation for a high plasma insulin concentration and low c-peptide. We have that removed from the argument. Then it is considering, is it artifact &#8211; that is where the insulin sample was from. There aren&#8217;t any other obvious sources of Actrapid other than those two I have mentioned.

Or, alternatively, whether the blood sample taken for the hypo screening at around 10:30pm that night, was taken via the broken cannula, which within itself, may have held insulin that then contaminated the blood sample. I do not recall how the blood sample was taken and do not know the mechanics of cannula function, so cannot really comment and I can only share my observations and thoughts.

On 27th July 2021, the cannula was observed leaking as the dressing was wet [I3749]. On the night of 28th July 2021, it was identified by the nurse that the cannula wasn&#8217;t working [I3415], resulting in it having to be replaced with a new one in a different location. The nurse records that AB was recannulated at 2am [I3575]. Having looked at the cannula assessment records, for some reason, the cannula failing and being replaced that night has not been recorded. It is not known whether the cannula was flushed between the administration of the Actrapid and the first dose of Dex [I3750] and my recollection of that night isn&#8217;t clear. 190.The nursing assessment note for this night can be found at [I3575] and the doctor on call, Dr J&#8217;s handwritten record can be found at [I3414-I3415]. Unfortunately neither note records in detail why the cannula failed or the discussions I had with the nurse about whether it had failed or not. I recall asking the nurse a few times whether the cannula was ok after the Dex bolus had been given, as the dressing keeping it in place was very wet. The nurse questioned whether the wetness was due to AB sweating but that didn&#8217;t seem like a fitting explanation to me. I can&#8217;t recall whether the dressing was wet before the Dex was given, but I do recall that after it was given, we observed a build-up of fluid under the dressing holding the cannula in place. It was obvious the cannula was not working and we didn&#8217;t know how much of the treatment was actually going in; the nurse agreed to get the doctor who came down and agreed it was broken and that a new cannula was needed.</span></p>

It was &#8220;probably unlikely&#8221; that the manipulation of the cannula in this way had resulted in a plasma insulin level of 160.9mmol/l approximately 1&#189; hours after the infusion stopped.  It was &#8220;a possibility but unlikely&#8221;.  It was &#8220;probably safe to discount that&#8221; because other cannula failures had not caused the same problem (all XX by HHJ).   We note however that that logic does not stand up to scrutiny.  We simply do not know if previous cannula failures caused high plasma insulin levels because of the paucity of available hyposcreens and the hospital&#8217;s failure to implement a rigorous blood testing regime.  The only basis on which Professor Hindmarsh moved from accepting that cannula error was an equal possibility to &#8220;discounting&#8221; the theory was, therefore, unsupportable.  When asked one final question by NGQC, the professor agreed that although this was not the likely explanation, it was &#8220;still possible&#8221;.  He would &#8220;love to do those kind of studies to advance further&#8221; his understanding in this area.  In conclusion, even on an analysis of the medical evidence alone, (without bringing into play the wider canvas material), it therefore remains open to the court to find that the high plasma insulin reading on 28 July 2021 was caused by cannula error rather than maternal interference.</span></p>

Overnight, during the break in his two days of evidence, I read his evidence from the first day and cross-related it to the report. I have studied his evidence again both before and during the writing of this judgment. Although I do not have the experience and expertise of Professor Hindmarsh in this complex field of medical science, and although it may sound impertinent when speaking of the work of such a renowned expert, I agree with the contents of his report. Essential parts of his reasoning can be found at E60-61 and at E228 in the passages that I have set out above.

There is simply no basis for suggesting that anyone else might have done so. I find that the mother would have had ample opportunity to do so and, if she so chose, would have had the means to do so. There were amounts of insulin in her home and she could easily have brought it to the hospital unnoticed. </span></p>

That is that the mother did administer insulin to him that night. She probably did so after the pump was switched off at 20:38. As a result, she caused his blood glucose levels to be dangerously low. There are many reasons why she may have done that (i.e. her reasoning), as I have already explained but, given her denials, it would be speculative for me to try to identify them at this stage, beyond that which I have said already. </span></p>

I do not know why the treatment plan was changed. He seemed to respond well to the new treatment as he had mainly had mild hypos and highs until 3rd September 2021, which was when he experienced his next difficult-to-treat hypo. Dr B says that the unusual hypos stopped because of the surveillance, but they might also have stopped because AB was on a treatment plan that worked better for him better. He never worked well on the insulin pump or infusion pump. The type of insulin he was put on was the same that he had had back in November 2020 and which he had done well on up until it was changed in March 2021.</span></p>

There was more scrutiny of exactly what he was eating, drinking and amount of urine he was passing (we were weighing it). It is recorded in an email from the specialist nurse that Dr B was reviewing AB&#8217;s insulin requirements every day and making adjustments. Prior to the enhanced observations lots of different doctors were involved in AB&#8217;s care, so I query whether having one doctor monitoring everything made a bit of a difference too.</span></p>

This advice conflicted with my understanding that I was supposed to keep him snacked up. He would always have breakfast, lunch and dinner and if he was low in between, I would allow him a snack. Under the enhanced observation, I can see that AB stopped having food between meals and instead got better at eating three set meals a day; he was under a stricter regime so unless it was in his plan, he wasn&#8217;t allowed it [I3471].</span></p>

This is a good opportunity also for mum to step back and focus on own wellbeing. Mum said she has been able to do this and has been going home for a few hours every day to have a break.

As Dr B, Consultant Paediatric Diabetologist, pointed out hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia is a dangerous condition. The brain is reliant on a constant supply of glucose for energy and normal function. The brain only has sufficient stores of glycogen to convert to glucose to last for 20 minutes. Thereafter the brain will switch to ketone bodies such as 3-betahydroxybutyrate as an alternative energy source. In non-ketotic hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia glucose is no longer available in adequate amounts to maintain normal brain function and the production of ketones is suppressed by the high circulating insulin concentration. This can lead to seizures, brain cell death, coma and on occasions death. As a result of the Strategy Meeting AB would be allowed to the maternal home however with grandparents in charge of treatment.&#8217; </span></p>

None of us told her and she was never there when we accessed it. During the safety plan the Mother did not have time alone with AB. If [the brothers] were in the house and I went to the loo, one of them would be in the room where they could see AB. If [the brothers] were not around, I would take AB upstairs with me.

Under the Safety Plan I was not allowed to sleep in the same room as AB so I had been sleeping in my mum&#8217;s bedroom. As my dad works night shifts, that bedroom would be empty at night. My mum had been sleeping where I usually slept, in AB&#8217;s bedroom on the second bed.</span></p>

She finger pricked him with me in the room, which confirmed he was hypo with level of 3.7. She treated him with 3 jelly babies. At 9:44pm, he was 3.6, so she treated him with three further jelly babies. At 10pm, he was 3.7, so he had 3 more jelly babies. At this point we made a decision to ring the out of hours doctor. The doctor asked us to check his blood glucose levels again on the phone and they were only 3.5 so he was given another three jelly babies. At 10:24pm, he was 3.5 so he was given 3 jelly babies and we called the out of hours team again who advised to give him another round of jelly babies which we did [I4103]. We checked him again at 10:45pm and he was 10.2. My mum had been treating the hypo with 3 jelly babies each time and it required 5 rounds in total to bring him up, something which had never happened before. During this time, I was speaking to AB trying to wake him up properly; he wasn&#8217;t unresponsive and was awake enough to be able to eat the jelly babies. During the first few 15 minute waits, I was going back into my mum&#8217;s bedroom to get some rest. I hadn&#8217;t expected it to take this amount of time to bring his levels up, so had kept going back into the separate bedroom thinking I could get some rest.</span></p>

It was like the effect of the jelly babies suddenly kicked in. There seemed to be a delay in action, but once his bloods came up, they stayed up and didn&#8217;t drop again. I do not know why it took over an hour to resolve the hypo. Considering the amount of jelly babies he had eaten, we were expecting him to be much higher than 10.2 and indeed by the time we arrived at A &amp; E at 11:45pm (at the request of the doctors), his bloods were 22.6 [I4079].</span></p>

He had his blood sugar levels tested by the finger prick (Accucheck Aviva meter) at 00:52 (4.2), 03:35 (3.6), 3.55 (3.6), 4:00 (3.4), 4:14 (3.9). I exhibit a photograph of the Accucheck Aviva meter readings from that night [EXH.KR-1]. I took this photo during a contact with AB as the meter is always handed over along with his other diabetes equipment. I always ask his Partner and yhe Father how he is doing at the beginning of contact and check the finger prick meter so I know roughly whether he is going through a good or bad patch. The Partner will often say &#8220;it&#8217;s been a nightmare, he&#8217;s been going high&#8221; or she&#8217;ll tell me that &#8220;he&#8217;s been having bad hypo&#8217;s&#8221;. The Partner did say to me about a month ago in the park that a nurse said &#8220;don&#8217;t take this personally but do you think AB had been sneaking food behind your back?&#8221;. I know the nurses have advised that it&#8217;s normal for a child with type 1 diabetes to have three hypos a week but for AB, he can have them three times a day. I&#8217;m not in a position to say why he is still suffering from multiple hypos as I am not there to witness it.&#8217;</span></p>

If the event in question is not so proved, it is treated as having not occurred. That is the binary system that the court operates. Findings in the family Court should be subject to a similar forensic rigour as deployed in the criminal Courts. </span></p>

That is, it relies on different pieces of factual, expert and biochemical evidence, none of which on their own directly proves that the mother did act in the way alleged but which, the Local Authority says, when taken together demonstrate that she did so. Circumstantial evidence, when properly analysed, may lead to clear conclusions but it is essential that each of the constituent parts of the circumstances alleged are scrutinised and evaluated before any conclusion is reached. </span></p>

I must then decide what conclusions I can draw, fairly and reasonably, from any pieces of evidence that I do accept, combining together those pieces of evidence and the mother&#8217;s responses to them. In performing that exercise, I have to avoid engaging in guess-work or speculation about matters which have not been proved by any evidence. Further, I have to avoid what is sometimes called the ancient fallacy of the Sorites &#8211; allowing the elision of a number of unsubstantiated or irrelevant contentions to combine together to achieve an overall status beyond their collective evidential and probative value. </span></p>

First, having identified the alleged lie in issue, it must ask itself whether the Local Authority has proved to the requisite civil standard that the alleged lie has been told; at that first stage of the analysis it is important to differentiate between i) a lie and ii) story creep, mistake, confusion, memory failure, distortion arising from disability or immaturity, etc. Second, it must analyse why any proven lie has been told, recollecting that people may lie for many different reasons - such as embarrassment, a sense of shame for having caused injury accidentally, a desire to hide some other wrong-doing, a wish not to &#8216;wash their dirty linen in public&#8217;, fear that the truth might be misinterpreted or might be otherwise damaging, resentment about the enquiry, a mistaken belief that lying might improve the witness&#8217;s position in the case, etc. Third, if the lie is proven, the relevance of the lie to the enquiry must be considered &#8211; some lies, although reprehensible, will have nothing to do with the outcome of the case beyond assisting with the analysis of the person&#8217;s general credibility. Fourth, it has to be remembered that, just because a person lies about one issue, it does not mean that he/she can be taken to have lied about everything.</span></p>
