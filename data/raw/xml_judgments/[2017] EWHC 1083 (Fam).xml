However, there is a duty at common law to arrange for its proper disposal. This duty falls primarily upon the personal representatives of the deceased (see Williams v Williams (1881) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="20 ChD 659" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">20 ChD 659</ref>; Rees v Hughes <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1946] KB 517" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1946">[1946] KB 517</ref>). An executor appointed by will is entitled to obtain possession of the body for that purpose (see Sharp v Lush (1879) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="10 ChD 468" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">10 ChD 468</ref>, 472; Dobson v North Tyneside Health Authority and Another <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 1 FLR 598" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 1 FLR 598</ref>, 602, obiter) even before the grant of probate. Where there is no executor, that same duty falls upon the administrators of the estate, but they may not be able to obtain an injunction for delivery of the body before the grant of letters of administration (see Dobson).&#8221;</span></p>

That was a case where the Applicant was the natural mother of the deceased. The Respondents were persons who were entitled to the grant of letters of administration of the estate. They were his adoptive mother and the mother of his daughter. The dispute arose because the Applicant had given her consent to adoption when the deceased was only four days old. The adoption order was made. In fact, the deceased was an Australian Aborigine. It was said at one point, although it was rejected by Hale J, that he was part of the so called &#8220;stolen generation&#8221; who had been improperly removed from their Aboriginal parents in the 1970s to be assimilated into white Australian society. The Applicant requested that the deceased's body be transported to Australia for burial in accordance to Aboriginal custom.

One was the nature of the adoption, the fact that the Applicant had given up the deceased at a very young age; secondly, the deceased's Aboriginal heritage and the importance attached to correct burial procedures; thirdly, the initial agreement reneged upon after death; fourthly, the deceased's daughter's interest in knowing that, in due course, things were done in accordance with her father's Aboriginal heritage; fifthly, the interest of other members of the Australian family; and finally, the deceased's wishes. Hale J held that they were all special circumstances and that she had to consider them in combination. She then went on to consider whether it was &#8220;necessary or expedient&#8221; by reason of those special circumstances to exercise the discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/116" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 116</ref> of the Supreme Court Act to prefer the natural mother over the Respondents, entitled as the latter were to the grant of letters of administration. She had no difficulty in concluding that it was &#8220;not necessary&#8221; to exercise the discretion because arrangements for the funeral had been made before the Applicant arrived on the scene.

There Hart J noted that &#8220;The authorities also establish that at common law it is the duty of a householder under whose roof a person has died to make arrangements for the dignified and decent burial of the deceased, at least in circumstances where the deceased is a poor person in relation to whom no other arrangements can be made &#8211; see </span><span class="Emphasis" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">R v Stewart</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt"> 12 Ad &amp; E 773</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt"> at 778.&#8221; The simple fact was that the hospital required to dispose of the body due to demands on space in the hospital morgue.  It was contended that the hospital was in like position to a householder and, subject to the claims of others who have the better right to make arrangements for the disposal of the body, it had both the duty and the right to make such arrangements.

Certainly it is 'amorphous' (see paragraph 14 above) and, to the extent that the High Court has repeatedly been able to utilise it to make provision for children and vulnerable adults not otherwise protected by statute, can, I suppose be described as 'pervasive'. But it is not 'ubiquitous' in the sense that it's reach is all- pervasive or unlimited. Precisely because it's powers are not based either in statute or in the common law it requires to be used sparingly and in a way that is faithful to its evolution. It is for this reason that any application by a Local Authority to invoke the inherent jurisdiction may not be made as of right but must surmount the hurdle of an application for leave pursuant to s100 (4) and meet the criteria there.&#8221;</span></p>

These children fell within the responsibility of the King as parens patriae.  In 1540 the Court of Wards was set up to enforce the right of the Crown in the execution of its duties in connection with wardship.  That Court endured for over 100 years but was abolished in 1660.  The Wardship jurisdiction survived in the Court of Chancery and expanded its reach beyond property rights to welfare and protection of vulnerable children.
