They now have a daughter, E, who is the subject of these care proceedings brought by the local authority, A County Council, on 16 January 2015. E was born on that date and so she is 9 months old. She was made the subject of an interim care order on 4 February 2015. She was then placed in the care of her paternal grandparents with whom she remains living.</p>

Moreover, I do not understand why it was raised that the parents may have been disadvantaged by their youth, social background and/or lack of income.

Had I taken the view that the cross examination was breaching the boundary of fairness, I would have intervened. I did not. On the contrary I found the cross examination to be a most useful exercise. When the parents asked for breaks in their evidence, their requests were immediately granted at whatever stage in their cross-examination.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:1.48in">Arising 2cm above the right wrist, a patterned injury was noted. It comprised of opposing arcs of blue bruising with more centrally placed shortened bands of either intradermal red bruising or reddened abrasions or possibly a combination of both. The blue bruising comprised of two vertically orientated arcs whose contours essentially opposed each other, the medial measuring 1.2cm by 0.4cm and the more lateral measured 2cm by 0.5cm. The gap between them ranged from 0.9cm to 1.1cm. The shorter marks were just out with and central of the blue bruising and more centrally placed. These comprised of short, relatively narrow rectangular shaped components somewhat resembling incisor type contact marks. Again these components seemed to oppose each other. Two were laterally placed, the more superior measured 0.5cm to 0.7cm by 0.2cm, the more inferior measured 0.7cm by 0.2cm. The more medial was more closely approximated with the more superior on the lateral side and measured 0.4cm by 0.1cm. Overall, the marks were reminiscent of a bite mark, but formal odontological opinion is sought;</p>

I remind myself that there was no dissent amongst the medical experts about the bruises, marks and injuries identified by the pathologists. Accordingly, in the light of the observations of Dr. Kolar set out above, I am more than satisfied that I should rely on and prefer the evidence of the examining forensic pathologists about the degree and extent of any injuries identified at post mortem rather than on the descriptions provided by the treating clinicians where there is a variance between the two.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The purpose and consequence of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was extensively explored with a number of the forensic experts in oral evidence. They were unanimous in their respective views. First, CPR is not intended and does not have the consequence of restoring a functioning circulation. Second, its limited purpose is to seek to maintain a blood supply to the vital organs (i.e. the brain and the heart) until such time, if at all, when cardiac output is restored. Third, it is extremely unlikely that CPR would achieve a functioning circulation in the peripheries of the body; as Dr. Lawler told me the further away from the centre of the body the less likely it is that CPR would restore the circulation. Fourth, even if some degree of circulation to the peripheries was achieved during CPR it would not provide sufficient blood to result in the bruises identified on F&#8217;s right forearm and right wrist &#8211; both as to size and extent. Fifth, accordingly both of the forensic pathologists and Dr. Cartlidge were agreed that the rib fractures, the right forearm bruise, the right wrist bruise and the facial petechial haemorrhages  did not result from the attempts at resuscitation but resulted from in life events.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In contrast is the position in respect of the chest bruise and the facial abrasions. The forensic pathologists described the chest bruise, uniquely, as stippled in appearance. They agreed that rarely such a bruise can appear as a result of CPR. A stippled bruise, especially over a bony area of the body, can result from a post mortem event. This is because such a bruise does not require a functioning circulation and results from the squeezing of residual blood from blood vessels where pressure is repeatedly applied against an underlying bony area. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Similarly facial abrasions can occur as a post mortem artefact. Abrasions of the skin do not require a functioning circulation to be sustained. The treating examining clinicians considered these facial marks, which they termed bruises &#8211; which they are not &#8211; resulted from the application of facial masks during the resuscitative attempts. Dr Lawler accepted this as a possible cause of these injuries but doubted a facial mask would cause abrasions or that resuscitative attempts could cause the degree of abrasions identified on F&#8217;s face. Dr Kolar expressed similar reservations especially in respect of the number and extent of the areas of facial abrasions. Both however, could not exclude the real possibility that they were caused by that mechanism. Accordingly, given the fact that facial abrasions can result as a post mortem artefact and that F was the subject of prolonged resuscitative efforts, I am satisfied that these facial marks are more likely than not to be a consequence of the medical equipment used and/or the attempts made to resuscitate F. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Earlier this year there was a considerable dispute and debate between Professor Freemont and Dr. Malcolmson, in particular, about whether the rib fractures could have been sustained only in life, with a functioning circulation, or whether they could have been sustained peri-mortem or post mortem as a consequence of the resuscitative procedures. Professor Freemont preferred the former and Dr. Malcolmson advanced the latter. The issue was discussed at length in the first experts&#8217; meeting. As a result of the intervention of Dr. Cartlidge it was agreed that a second osteo-articular pathologist should be instructed and I approved the instruction of Professor Mangham. To his very great credit he prepared a report in very short order. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his opinion the histopathological slide prepared from  one of the three rib fractures showed the presence of osteocyte necrosis (i.e. the death of the nucleus of a cell). The presence of this feature was of singular significance. Osteocyte necrosis only occurs in life with a functioning circulation. Moreover it only affects the cells at the site of or adjacent to the fracture. In the slide examined, osteocyte necrosis was only seen in cells at or adjacent to the facture site.</p>

Both readily deferred, at the meeting and in oral evidence, to the expert opinions of Professors Mangham and Freemont.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Professor Freemont entirely agreed with the presence of osteocyte necrosis in the slide he had examined and agreed with Professor Manhgam&#8217;s opinion on the significance of the same. They were agreed that it would take some two hours after death, or the cessation of a functioning circulation, for the presence of osteocyte necrosis to become evident on staining and subsequent histopathological examination. They were agreed, for the purposes of the experts&#8217; meeting the spectrum ranged from 2 to 12 hours after death. At the upper end of the range one would expect to see evidence of reparative processes which were not identified by either of them. Professor Mangham favoured a time frame for the rib fractures being sustained of between 4 to 8 hours before death, whereas Professor Freemont preferred a narrower time frame of 2 to 4 hours. In the circumstances of this case the differences between them on time frame is of little real significance. The principal importance of their agreed evidence is that these rib fractures could only have been sustained in life and not post mortem.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was considerable criticism of Professor Freemont by counsel for the parents that he had not mentioned the issue of osteocyte necrosis in his reports to the court. He asserted that he had done what was asked of him in dating the fractures, namely that they were sustained in life. I am troubled by Professor Freemont&#8217;s failure to mention osteoctye necrosis in any of his reports or to mention the same in the first experts&#8217; meeting. He made no mention of these histopathological findings until the issue was reported by Professor Mangham. I do not understand why he did not do so. The very late introduction of osteocyte necrosis must be very difficult for the parents to understand and is, undoubtedly, frustrating for them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, a considerable time was expended upon the research base for the timings of the  detection of osteocyte necrosis. It was plain that all research studies related to adults. Dr. Cartlidge made the powerful point that metabolic and other processes occur faster and more rapidily in children, especially in babies, than they do in adults. Thus he was concerned about whether the time frames postulated by Professors Mangham and Freemont related to adults or to babies. At the end of his evidence Dr. Cartlidge confirmed that he accepted that osteocyte necrosis only occurred in life and his point related only to how fast that would develop and thus be detectable in a young infant. I accept Dr. Cartlidge&#8217;s evidence and his concerns. The consequence of it is, however, that F&#8217;s rib fractures may have occurred closer in time to his death than opined by either Professor Mangham or Professor Freemont, but nevertheless, it must have resulted from an in life event with a functioning circulation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Second, it was put to Professors Freemont and Mangham that the fact that they had received only one slide of the rib fracture was deficient and impaired their ability to give a clear opinion. Neither had any hesitation in rejecting that assertion and both were clear that one slide of a fracture was more than sufficient for their forensic purposes.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Third, it was suggested that slides of the adjacent two ribs ought to have been taken and provided to them. Neither expert accepted the same. I find the implied suggestion that the one rib, of which a slide was prepared, could have been sustained in life, but that the other two adjacent rib fractures could have  been sustained in a separate application of force post mortem to be fanciful and unrealistic. I am satisfied that all three rib adjacent fractures were sustained by the same application of force and were sustained in life when there was a functioning circulation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I note that Dr. Malcomson and Dr. Kolar, who are both very experienced pathologists, have  changed their practices as a result of this case. They both now have or propose to refer more slides of rib fractures to osteo-articular pathologists for examination. Hitherto they have readily accepted that rib fractures, albeit rarely, resulted from CPR on the basis of the degree of bleeding seen at the site of the fractures. As a result of this case they recognise that further forensic investigations are likely to be required to determine whether those fractures were sustained in life or post mortem.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Rosie and Dr. Evans, the odontologists, were agreed that the mark seen on F&#8217;s right arm was a probable, the former, or a possible, the latter, human bite mark. Dr. Rosie considered it was more probably an adult human bite mark. Dr Evans felt constrained, by the visible features, to conclude that it was a possible human bite mark, be that adult or a child. There is no history given by the parents, in whose constant care one or other of them were, of F exhibiting symptoms of pain or crying when in the presence of other babies or small children. I am satisfied, despite Dr. Evans&#8217; reluctance to be drawn on the same, in contrast to Dr. Rosie, that the infliction of a bite mark would have been very painful for F and he would have cried upon the application  of the same. Dr. Cartlidge agreed. There is no history of a child inflicting a bite mark on F at which he cried. </p>

Dr. Cartlidge considered it was a bite mark and could think of no other explanation for the injury. All of the relevant forensic experts were agreed that this was an inflicted injury. The pathologists were of the clear opinion that the extent and depth of the bruising was such that it could only have been sustained at a time when F had a functioning circulation. Furthermore, none of them could postulate a mechanism by which such an injury could have been sustained during the attempts to revive F. Accordingly, I am left with the conclusion of the medical experts that this injury was sustained in life, it was an inflicted injury and, on the balance of probabilities, was a bite mark which was inflicted by an adult.</p>

She went to sleep and was next aware of the father trying to wake her saying &#8220;AB there is something wrong with F&#8221;.</p>

I cannot accept that a loving and devoted father would not have at least tried to make a 999 call. Furthermore, the father&#8217;s stutter does not explain the increasingly long pauses in his evidence when cross examined by leading counsel for the local authority on difficult aspects of his evidence.

I consider it entirely appropriate and proper that forensic experts of the same or of different disciplines should challenge their colleagues on their findings, their conclusions and their reasons for the same. Dr. Cartlidge, as the sole consultant paediatrician instructed in this matter was at the forefront in taking his colleagues to task, which he considered, rightly in my view, to be good clinical practice. </p>

Even if, however, I put his evidence to one side, I am still left with the powerful evidence of Professor Mangham on the presence and significance of osteocyte necrosis in the slide of one of the three antero-lateral rib fractures. Neither of the forensic pathologists nor Dr. Cartlidge sought to gainsay any of his evidence on that issue. The latter took some issue with the time of the detection of osteocyte necrosis in very young babies, but the import of Dr. Cartlidge&#8217;s evidence was that the rib fractures were likely to have occured at a time closer to F&#8217;s death than that opined by Professor Mangham or Professor Freemont. Dr. Cartlidge did not begin to suggest that ostecyte necrosis could have developed after F ceased to have a functioning circulation.</p>
