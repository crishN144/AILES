The mother disputes this allegation and it does not seem that any substantive evidence was produced by the father in support of it.

The mother says that she felt pressurised into agreeing for the order to continue and, again, it is neither necessary nor possible for me to resolve the dispute which was before the Canadian Courts certainly though I note that this is a case where the mother asserts that she was subjected to a deeply abusive relationship, both emotionally and physically, at the hands of the father.  </span></p>

She makes a series of very serious allegations against the father, which, in many respects, mirror the allegations that the mother had already made.  They include allegations that he was controlling, emotionally manipulative, verbally abusive and at times physically threatening to all who lived in the home including the children.  She describes how he would often yell in their faces.  She says that A and B are terrified of their father.
