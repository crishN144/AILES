	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This reserved judgment is delivered following a hearing during which I considered two applications in respect of a 14-year-old boy, hereafter called J, one by an NHS Trust for declarations and orders concerning medical treatment, the other by his local authority for a care order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Shortly before I was planning to hand down the judgment, I received the sad news that J&#8217;s father had tragically died. My initial inclination was to postpone the delivery of this judgment completely. Having convened an urgent telephone hearing, however, in which I discussed the situation with counsel, I have decided, for reasons which will become clear, to deliver a judgment dealing with some issues that have arisen in the course of the hearing. Other issues will have to be reconsidered in the light of the latest developments.</p>

The evidence demonstrates that this was a close-knit and loving family, and the passing of J&#8217;s father will be a terrible loss for all of them. Save for the single issue which lies at the heart of this case, this family would never have come to the attention of social services, let alone be the subject of court proceedings. </p>

This has been confirmed by an analysis of their medical records but they themselves have been reluctant to accept the diagnosis. They have challenged the mainstream and scientific opinion on HIV and AIDS. Over the years, they have expressed the view that their prescribed anti-retroviral therapy (&#8220;ART&#8221;) has been responsible for adversely affecting their health. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The possibility that J might be HIV positive first came to the attention of doctors as long ago as 2003. Attempts to engage the family at that stage were unsuccessful. A further referral was made in 2010 when J&#8217;s mother was being treated. Appointments were made with Dr Z, the lead consultant for children with HIV at the local NHS Trust. The family failed to attend the appointments. As a result, they were referred by the Trust to the local authority and this led to the authority making an application for a child assessment order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/43" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 43</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> in December 2011. At that stage, a children&#8217;s guardian was appointed to the proceedings and the NHS Trust was joined as a party. J&#8217;s parents indicated that J had been tested overseas. They would not agree to further testing. As the case related to health concerns, the Trust was invited to make its own application to the court. Accordingly, on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2012, the Trust made an application under the inherent jurisdiction, seeking initially an order that J undergo HIV testing. The same guardian was appointed in the application under the inherent jurisdiction. Leave was granted to the local authority to withdraw its application. </p>

J&#8217;s parents were also ordered to hand over to the Tipstaff every passport relating to J or other document which would enable him to leave England and Wales. </p>

J duly attended an appointment on the following day. At that point, he agreed to be tested if his mother was re-tested and found to be positive. His mother would not agree to be re-tested. At that point, J refused to speak further to the guardian. </p>

An order was also made for the mother&#8217;s hospital records to be disclosed. At the next hearing on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, on this occasion before Moylan J, the court invited the local authority to consider (a) joining the proceedings as a party or (b) whether it was appropriate for them to commence care proceedings. At a further hearing before me on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2012, the guardian proposed that J should be seen by a psychologist to establish whether he was of an age or understanding to make a decision about the testing. I duly directed that Dr Nicholas Banks should be appointed to carry out that assessment. I further directed the local authority to provide its core assessment to the guardian by 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December. That assessment concluded that there should not at that stage be any application for a care order. </p>

The parents failed to comply with that order. Accordingly, on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> April, the guardian issued an application for their committal. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That application came back before me on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2013. I took the view that committal was unlikely to be an effective remedy to achieve the aim of having J seen by Dr Banks and tested for HIV. On the other hand, it seemed to me that the circumstances were by that stage sufficiently serious to give rise to reasonable grounds for believing that J was suffering significant harm as a result of his parents&#8217; unreasonable attitude and, specifically, unreasonable refusal to allow him to see Dr Banks and Dr Z. Accordingly, I made a direction for a report under section 37 of the Children Act, and an interim care order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>. I listed the matter for a further hearing two days later. The making of the care order automatically discharged the existing wardship. Following the making of the interim care order, the local authority removed J from his parents and placed him in foster care. </p>

At that stage, he was still indicating that he would not see Dr Banks, although appointments were made for this to take place. At this hearing, a further order was made under section 34(3) of the Children Act providing that, until further order, his parents were precluded during contact from discussing with him or making statements to him concerning the testing for HIV in general, or whether or not he should attend any appointments with Dr Z or Dr Banks. </p>

At that hearing, agreement was reached that there should be some unsupervised contact, but subject to a contract of expectations signed by the parents and J and approved by the court. It was also ordered that J should be separately represented. A further hearing was arranged before me on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, at which further agreement was reached regarding contact pending the next hearing. By that stage, Dr Banks had produced his first report following his meeting with J. The local authority indicted that in the light of that report it intended to issue care proceedings. That application was duly filed on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May following the completion of the section 37 report. Meanwhile, J and his parents continued to cooperate with appointments with Dr Z and her team and with the local authority. </p>

By the date of the next hearing before me on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, the professionals had all come to the conclusion that, given the strong feelings held by J and his parents, the better course was that J should return home under the interim care order, provided that terms could be agreed. During the course of the day, following negotiations and submissions, two contacts of expectations, one for J and the other for his parents, were drawn up and agreed. The contract of expectations concerning J provided that he would be expected inter alia to keep all appointments with Dr Z and her team; meet with his social worker and his guardian as required; and keep appointments with the dentist and optician as may be arranged. The contract with J&#8217;s parents required inter alia that they would ensure that J kept all appointments with Dr Z; attend those appointments with Dr Z should she request them to attend; read letters and information sent to them by Dr Z; contact Dr Z if they have any queries about J&#8217;s health; allow J to meet his social worker and guardian; meet with the guardian and social worker themselves as required; and not discourage J from taking medication if he decides he would like to do so. On that basis, I directed that J be returned to the care of his parents by 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the outset of the hearing, the NHS Trust, supported by the local authority and children&#8217;s guardian, was seeking a declaration that J was not Gillick competent to make decisions about taking ART or receiving other treatment and help for HIV. In addition, the local authority, supported by the Trust and the guardian, was seeking a final care order on the basis of a plan whereunder J and his parents would be expected to sign and adhere to further contracts of expectations. In the event that they failed to comply, consideration would be given to removing J into foster care again. Further, the NHS Trust asked the court to grant mandatory injunctions directing J to (1) commence taking ART daily, initially under direct observation and at the direction of the treating team; (2) attend the children&#8217;s HIV summer camp in the summer of 2014; (3) attend the local peer support groups in his local area and (4) attend psychology appointments at the Trust. In addition, he would need to continue his regular attendance at the Trust to see his treating team and have check ups as to his medical condition. The guardian supported both these positions. Thus the professional parties were lined up behind a coercive approach to the problems arising from J&#8217;s refusal to take his ART. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the end of the hearing, the respective positions of the professional parties had changed. All three maintained the position that J was not Gillick competent. The local authority continued to propose that an interim care order should be made, but indicated that &#8220;any anxiety concerning the power bestowed by an interim care order upon the local authority to determine where J will live can be dealt with by a recording on the face of any order that the authority would not propose to remove J from the care of his parents without first returning the matter to court, save in circumstances which would justify the making of an emergency protection order&#8221;. Furthermore, the NHS Trust abandoned its application for a mandatory order directed against J. Instead, it sought declarations as to J&#8217;s best interests, namely that it was in his best interests to receive ART, to undertake psychological therapy, to engage in peer support, and to comply with a contract of expectations, and an order directed at J&#8217;s parents to comply with the contract of expectations. These amended positions advanced by the Trust and local authority were supported by the CAFCASS manager (the guardian having been unable to attend the hearing for personal reasons). The parents and J contended, as they had done throughout, that J was Gillick competent, that the parents&#8217; compliance with the contract of expectations should not be enforced by a court order, and that the court should consider making a supervision order, either a full order or interim order with or without a wardship order.</p>

Shortly before I was due to send out a draft judgment to the parties, I received two important pieces of information. It is important to state that no evidence has yet been filed on either of these developments, so I simply record in outline what I have been told. First, the Trust has informed me that there has been a further deterioration in J&#8217;s health. Secondly, as I have already stated, J&#8217;s father has tragically died. My initial response was to adjourn delivery of this judgment completely but, after the hastily-convened telephone hearing with counsel, I have decided to continue to give judgment on issues (i) to (iii) above. All counsel agreed that it was important that these issues be resolved without further delay. The remaining issues will inevitably be affected by the recent developments, and a further hearing will be necessary to consider how they should be resolved.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The HIV virus infects cells of the human immune system, including most characteristically a cell called the CD4 cell which is an important part of the human immune response against infection. In the absence of drug treatment, HIV infection results in a falling level of CD4 cells over time, which results in serious overwhelming infections and other complications, which may be fatal. The time taken for the CD4 count to fall from normal to dangerous levels is highly variable between individuals. In particular, whilst 20% of children who acquire HIV infection at birth or in early infancy will be severely ill by the age of 12 months, 80% will not, and some will display no symptoms at all of HIV infection well into their teenage years. The term Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) refers to advanced HIV infection with severe manifestations of a weakened immune system. Twenty years ago, progression of HIV infection to AIDS and then death was considered inevitable, albeit with a timescale that varied enormously between individuals. Over the last 15 years, the availability of effective drug treatments for HIV has dramatically changed this picture. HIV cannot be cured, but treatment with combinations of usually three different drugs can prevent the progression of asymptomatic HIV to AIDS. Patients who already have advanced immune suppression or AIDS at the time of diagnosis can be treated, and a significant degree of recovery of the immune system can be achieved. However, the major barrier to successful treatment of HIV is late diagnosis, when the CD4 count has already fallen so low that complete recovery is impossible and irreversible life threatening complications may already have set in.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Drug treatments for HIV do have side-effects which can range from common relatively insignificant side-effects to uncommon but more severe side-effects. However large studies published in reputable medical journals have consistently shown that the benefits of treating HIV vastly outweigh the detrimental effects of antiviral medication. In the early days of my medical career, medical care of children with HIV consisted of providing relief of symptoms to dying children. It now consists of providing long-term health care to children with a chronic health condition, almost all of whom will survive into adulthood. The only deaths I have seen in my own experience in the last five years have occurred with late diagnosis of HIV or not taking antiviral medication as prescribed.&#8221;</p>

He noted that there continued to be side-effects from medications, but the risk of severe side-effects has fallen in recent years, as has the number of tablets needed to be taken each day.

As this is a common infection in people with HIV, she was asked whether she wished to have a test. At that stage, she declined. In 2003, she was diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis and admitted to hospital in London. During this admission, she agreed to an HIV test and was found to be HIV positive. She was started on treatment for HIV but subsequently developed side effects associated with one of the medications and as a result her ART therapy was changed. She was readmitted to hospital in November 2003 and March 2004 with further complications. In August 2004, she stopped taking all ART medication because of symptoms which she thought were side effects. In May 2005, she was readmitted to hospital. At this point, her immune system was very low and she had a very high HIV viral load. She had also developed painful ulcerations. She was started on a new ART regime which made her feel very weak but led to an improvement in her ulcers and her HIV viral load declined to almost undetectable levels. </p>

As a result, Professor Johnson&#8217;s report does not give a complete picture. It is known, apparently, that in 2009 Mr A developed cryptococcal meningitis overseas. Seen in hospital in England in March 2010, it was confirmed that he was HIV positive. His CD4 count was very low and he also had a very high viral load. He was also found to be suffering from Hepatitis B. He was started on ART medication plus Septrin to prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, a common infection suffered by HIV patients with a low immunity. By the end of 2010, his condition had improved although his CD4 count was still low. In April 2011, he was readmitted to hospital with abdominal pain. On this occasion his HIV viral load was undetectable (as a result of the medication) but his immune system was still very impaired. At this point, he was on a new ART regimen and still taking Septrin to prevent the pneumonia and other medication to prevent a recurrence of the meningitis. Following his discharge, it was recommended that he should continue on the same treatment. He apparently then failed to attend the next review and there is no evidence in his medical records to indicate whether or not he subsequently took any medication. </p>

The ART drugs which he was prescribed in 2010 suppressed his viral load to undetectable levels which indicate they were controlling viral replication.&#8221; Professor Johnson advised that, if Mr A continued on HIV treatment, he would hopefully see his immune system returning to normal and then could have an almost normal life expectancy. However, if he failed to take the medication, she predicted that he was likely to develop other serious infections or malignancies which could be life threatening or leave him with permanent disability.</p>

He has not adequately understood the need to take greater account of, and weigh in his decision-making process, evidence-based medical opinion. He dismisses the value and merits of wider scientific opinion, preferring the more popular, entertainment media over the internet, to inform his opinion. Dr Banks added that it would appear that J is heavily influenced by his immediate family&#8217;s views. In addition, his psychometric personality profile suggests a higher level of dependency than would normally be the case with similar age peers. From the psychometric testing, Dr Banks detected a particularly high influence of family control or direction where J may be fearful of independent type thinking that challenges family values and norms, to a much higher degree than would be expected in the day to day socialisation process. Dr Banks therefore concluded that J was incapable of making a reasonable assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed medical treatment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his second report, Dr Banks reported that J remained clear that he did not believe that the HIV virus has proven scientific status or credibility. In this report, he added that J was of the view that the HIV virus has underlying racist elements as its recognition/detection is directed towards those of the African community. Dr Banks stated that J was likely to have been overwhelmed by the information he was receiving, both about his own condition and that of his parents. He thought that J was likely to experience considerable stress and conflict between the information received from professionals and that received from his parents in whom he clearly invests emotionally and who he has a need to trust. Dr Banks observed that information is not simply processed through a framework of rationality but also through an emotional framework where, when one was under pressure, siding with the known and trusted is likely to be the preferential route. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Banks advised that, if J were able to meet with other young people who are HIV positive and have the opportunity to discuss his own condition and relate this to their experiences, this would be of great value in allowing him a peer supported network to process some of the significant emotional and cognitive conflict which he is currently experiencing in a less emotionally pressurised form. Dr Banks thought that a forum composed of similar aged young people may add much to his understanding and ability to further process information in reaching a decision about his future behaviour and options. Dr Banks thought it might be helpful for J to have an opportunity to visit a laboratory and see the process of HIV testing. Such an experience, coupled with the opportunity to discuss his HIV status with a supportive peer group, and the appointment of a support mentor or counselling psychologist, might begin the process of cognitive challenge of his parents&#8217; views. Dr Banks thought, however, that the emotional alignment with his parents would take some time to shift. He noted that J does have an openness to receiving further information, although he thought that progressing this openness to further action may be short circuited by his parents&#8217; perspectives and influence. </p>

He feared that, if he was placed in foster care against his wishes again, J would not engage with health professionals at all. Furthermore, given the evidence that J experienced significant distress when being removed from his family on the earlier occasion, coupled with the fall off in educational achievement during his period of foster care, the suggestion of a further removal into foster care seemed less attractive. </p>

Given J&#8217;s age and level of understanding, one would expect him to have a greater acceptance of the scientific evidence concerning HIV. Instead, despite regular meetings with Dr Z, J continues to hold views that are contrary to the mainstream thinking. Dr Banks thought that J could not suitably weigh the pros and cons of treatment as a result of his rejection of the evidence-based science. Dr Banks confirmed his opinion that J had a misinformed view that was not independent of his parents. </p>

She describes him as appearing stunned about the news, whereas his parents displayed a quiet acceptance. She noted that J and his mother were very prompt in agreeing to come back to see her in clinic for monitoring. On this occasion, Dr Z discussed with J the possibility of psychological involvement and peer support. She noted that, throughout the consultation, although Mr A was neither uncooperative nor angry, he did on several occasions remind her of his own views about HIV and his opinion that treatment was unnecessary. On the other hand, Dr Z thought that Mrs A seemed very positive about the need to accept the result and move on. Dr Z suggested that, if Mrs A were to return to clinic herself for monitoring, that would be a good role model for J. Dr Z did not discuss this option with Mr A, knowing his strongly-held views.</p>

Clearly some of these meetings were very difficult. At one stage, the family said that they did not want J&#8217;s GP to be informed of his diagnosis. Dr Z replied that, as J&#8217;s CD4 count was low, he was at greater risk of infection and it was important that he was managed by somebody who knew of his HIV status and could treat him appropriately. She was concerned, however, that, if the GP was informed of J&#8217;s HIV status, there was a risk that the family would not seek help from him if J became unwell. Dr Z repeatedly explained to the family how modern medication is now much better tolerated in terms of side effects. Recent data clearly shows that over the past 10 years the mortality rate in children with HIV has dropped dramatically over the period when new ART medication has been used. </p>

During those discussions, J told Dr Z that his father had never taken any ART medication, contrary to what is set out in the medical records. Dr Z believes that this is a reflection of Mr A&#8217;s assertion that the report does not accurately reflect his health experience. Dr Z frankly told J that the only explanation for the reduction in his parents&#8217; viral load was that they had been taking ART medication. The next meeting on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December was clearly very difficult. On this occasion, J attended with his parents. His father was very angry about what J had been told about his and his wife&#8217;s health reports. Both parents vocalised their distress and anger about Dr Z getting involved in their lives. Dr Z thought that, in some respects, the way in which Mr A spoke to her was aggressive and inappropriate. She was concerned as to whether his own untreated HIV may be having an impact on his brain functioning. On this occasion, Dr Z spoke to J alone but found that he remained firm in his assertion that he would not take ART medication. </p>

The consensus held by clinicians across the world is that it is better to start taking medication at an early stage to prevent the deterioration in the immune system that results once HIV is contracted. Dr Z said that there is not a reasonable body of opinion that believes that HIV does not cause AIDS.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Z gave further evidence about the impact of side effects from ART medication. She said that the risk of side effects was greater the lower the immune system was when the ART medication was started. The medication she would recommend for J was a combination of three drugs &#8211; abacavir, lamivudine and darunavir. This amounts to a total of three tablets taken once a day, ideally at the same time every day. Dr Z said that any drug could have side effects which have to be managed. In this case, typical side effects are nausea, headache and diarrhoea, but these normally settle over time. She had found the children on this regime coped with it very well. She said that the side effects which the mother described suffering herself were associated with a different combination of drugs which the mother had taken some years earlier. She noted that J had probably observed the impact of these side effects on his mother. She accepted that this feeds into his aversion about taking medication. Dr Z noted, however, that the analysis of the causation of the mother&#8217;s side effects was complicated because alongside the ART medication she had also been taking medication for her TB. Dr Z thought that the peripheral neuropathy suffered by the mother could be attributable either to the ART or to the TB medication. Dr Z recognised the difficulty in taking ART at a time when the patient is not feeling unwell. In particular, if the consequences of taking the medication is to induce side effects which make the patient feel more ill than he did before he started taking it. She added, however, that side effects are generally well tolerated these days and the experience that J has of ART is coloured by his parents&#8217; perception of their own experiences. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Z acknowledged that there are always difficulties prescribing teenage patients to take medication if they are feeling well. Thus, if and when J gets to the stage of wanting to take the medication, he will have to be sufficiently strong and determined to carry on taking it. Dr Z stressed the importance of the patient continuing taking medication once the treatment is started. If you have virus circulating in the blood stream, if the level of medication is insufficient to prevent replication of the virus, that allows the virus to mutate and become resistant to the medication. There is therefore a greater risk if the medication is only taken intermittently. </p>

These discussions have been difficult because the family see her as someone who has destroyed their lives. She has found that, if she sees J first, they can usually have a reasonable discussion. J has remained cooperative about the ongoing clinical monitoring. It was notable that, at one point when describing her conversations with J, and in particular about trying to persuade him to take the medication, Dr Z became somewhat upset. She was being asked about whether or not she thought it would be better for J to be in foster care. She said that she would not like to see him in foster care again but &#8220;if I have a child who is refusing to take medication it places me in an acutely difficult clinical position which I am going to have to manage.&#8221; She felt that she needed to have someone taking responsibility for ensuring that the child is kept safe. </p>

She thinks that he can follow it intellectually but also is subject to an element of undue influence. She does not think that he has a problem understanding but the complexity of his parents&#8217; strong views feed into his thinking and make it a much more difficult process. Dr Z spoke of the further support that can be provided for J. There are psychologists within the Trust who are available to provide appropriate support and, in addition, there is a well established support network of other young people with HIV, including a small number locally and a much larger group in London and elsewhere in the country. By the time Dr Z came to give her evidence, J and his parents had agreed that their GP should be informed of his HIV status. Dr Z regarded this as reassuring for the reasons spelt out in her report. She also advised that, when travelling abroad, he should carry some document to say that he is at greater risk of infection. </p>

He agreed, however, that if he was convinced that the risk was high, the balance would come down in favour of taking the medication. He said:</p>

Whilst appropriate attention must be paid to the opinion of medical experts, those opinions need to be considered in the context of all the other evidence.

Where, however, a Gillick competent child refuses to give his or her consent to treatment, the court may, in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction, override that child&#8217;s wishes in its best interests and give its consent for the treatment to take place: <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re W (A minor)(medical treatment: courts jurisdiction</span>) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] Fam 64" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] Fam 64</ref>. In that case, the Court of Appeal was faced with an appeal on behalf of a sixteen-year-old girl suffering from anorexia who had been found by the judge at first instance to have sufficient understanding to make an informed decision about treatment but in respect of whom the judge had ordered treatment against her wishes. The Court of Appeal held that, while a sufficiently mature minor could consent to treatment, his or her refusal to give consent could not overrule the court&#8217;s grant of consent under its inherent jurisdiction. Whilst in exercising that jurisdiction the court would take account of the child&#8217;s wishes, those wishes could be overridden where his or her best interests so required. In his judgment in the case, Lord Donaldson of Lymington said, at page 81 C &#8211;D:</p>

Dr Banks has concluded, however, that J does not have sufficient understanding of HIV, its aetiology, and its potential outcome if medication is not taken. Furthermore, Dr Banks concludes that J has not adequately understood the need to take greater account of, and weigh in his decision making process, evidence-based medical opinion, preferring the views set out on the internet and those expressed by his family. </p>

First, I am satisfied that he now recognises, understands and respects Dr Z&#8217;s view to a much greater degree than he did previously. He was plainly impressed and affected by Dr Z&#8217;s painstaking exposition of his case in several hours of questioning during her oral evidence. Secondly, like all teenagers, J is in the process of separating emotionally and psychologically from his parents. This is illustrated in part by his recognition in his informal oral evidence that he has protective feelings towards his parents and their predicament, and that it will be better if hereafter he saw Dr Z on his own. In my judgment, he now genuinely sees the importance of reaching a decision independent of his parents. Thirdly, as he indicated at several points in his informal oral evidence, he acknowledges that his own views may evolve further. </p>

He did not feel a piece of paper was enough. If he does not accept the diagnosis, it must follow, in my judgment, that he does not fully understand the implication of not receiving the treatment. He therefore lacks the understanding necessary to weigh up the information and arrive at a decision. Applying the test laid down by the House of Lords, this points to a conclusion that he is not Gillick competent. </p>

A person who is not Gillick competent in respect of some treatments may be Gillick competent in respect of others. The decision to take ART is a complex decision which turns in part on J&#8217;s acceptance of the diagnosis. The decision to undergo monitoring, blood tests and chest x-rays is less complex, and in any event in this case J has agreed to these measures. Equally, the decision to accept psychotherapy and peer support is less complex. These decisions are not specifically dependent on J&#8217;s acceptance of his diagnosis but rather on the fact that the diagnosis has been given. He needs psychotherapy and peer support whether or not he accepts the diagnosis. Importantly, J accepts that he should have both psychotherapy and peer support. In all the circumstances, I conclude that he is Gillick competent in respect of decisions whether to undergo monitoring, and receive psychotherapy and peer support.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> The medical evidence in this case is clear and can be summarised as follows. J has been diagnosed as being HIV positive. Unless he starts ART medication he is likely to develop AIDS, suffer severe infection and die prematurely. If he takes ART, he is likely to avoid infection and survive much longer. Although there is a risk of side effects if he takes ART, that risk, and the seriousness of side effects attributable to medication, have been reduced in recent years as a result of advances in treatment. The risk of side effects is much less than the risk of not taking the medication. Once medication is started, it should be adhered to, since intermittent taking of medication reduces its effectiveness. The longer J waits before starting ART, the greater the risk he will develop AIDS and the more serious the side effects will be. </p>

She submits, however, the decision not just whether or not, but when, to start treatment is far more complex since, to be effective ART requires an extremely high level of adherence, and commitment, in reality to a lifelong therapy. In addition, there is a very real risk of side effects. Whilst she acknowledges on J&#8217;s behalf that modern medication is now said to be less toxic and much better tolerated, the risk remains that J would experience some side effects. She also submits that less is known about the long-term toxicities of newer drugs. She submits that even common non-dangerous side effects may cause disturbance to daily life which may affect, for example, J&#8217;s football performance. This in turn may affect his commitment to regular adherence to the treatment. She submits that it is therefore easy to understand the reluctance of a young adolescent who is otherwise fit and well to embark upon a course of medication that may make him feel unwell. Taking medication in those circumstances is, she submits, counter intuitive. In addition, for J, he has the experience and knowledge of the severe side effects experienced by his mother. </p>
