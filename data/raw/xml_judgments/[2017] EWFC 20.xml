	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This matter was listed with a time estimate of three days, to determine by whom PN, a little girl aged 11 months old, should be cared for following findings of fact I made in December 2016 with respect to how she came to sustain serious head injuries on separate occasions earlier in 2016 and significant emotional harm.  This judgment should be read with the judgment I handed down on 20 December 2016 detailing my findings of fact (see <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2016/61" uk:canonical="[2016] EWFC 61" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWFC 61</ref>).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Neither the mother nor the father advance themselves at this hearing as a carer for PN. The local authority that brings these proceedings, Cheshire East Borough Council, has filed and served a care plan that proposes that PN is placed permanently with her paternal great aunt, NM and her husband, HM, under the auspices of a special guardianship order.  That plan is supported by the father, LN, and, nominally, by the Children&#8217;s Guardian but opposed by the mother, NA.  The paternal great aunt and her husband have been the subject of a positive assessment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In opposition to the local authority&#8217;s plan, HA, who is PN&#8217;s maternal aunt, seeks placement of PN with her and her partner, CS.  The maternal aunt&#8217;s case is supported by the mother.  Whilst initially positive during the course of its completion, following certain findings I made about the maternal aunt at the fact finding hearing, the outcome of the assessment of the maternal aunt that is before the court is negative.  The maternal aunt, who has appeared in person throughout these proceedings, seeks a direction for a further assessment by an independent social worker, arguing that the local authority&#8217;s assessment of her is deficient.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Achieving a listing of this matter on these three days has required considerable work on the part of the court to identify available dates within a very busy list, has involved the considerable expense of convening the parties and their respective lawyers at court for the final hearing, has involved the expense of utilising a courtroom and associated court resources for the duration of the hearing and has involved changing the High Court itinerary, with the associated costs of moving a judge of the Division from London onto circuit specifically to hear this matter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context, it is a matter of very considerable dismay to the court that it has been necessary, on the second day of this final hearing and having heard the evidence presented by the local authority in support of its case, not only to grant the maternal aunt&#8217;s application for a further assessment of her and her partner by an independent social worker, but to direct a further assessment of the paternal great aunt and her husband by an independent social worker, in order to remedy patent defects in the local authority&#8217;s assessments caused by social work that has, at best, been lackadaisical and, at worst, is in plain contravention of the applicable statutory guidance and long established good practice.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The extensive background to this matter is set out in my judgment of 20 December 2016 and I do not repeat it here.  In summary, I found that PN had sustained head injuries on two separate occasions and that those injuries were, on the balance of probabilities, caused by the mother in April 2016 and at a point between 1 and 4 July 2016 during momentary losses of control at a time when she was abusing alcohol, was suffering from mental health difficulties, was under significant stress and struggling form a bond with, and parent PN.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, I found <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> parents caused significant emotional harm to PN, and exposed her to a risk of significant physical harm, on repeated occasions over an extended period of time by reason of their toxic and volatile relationship, which relationship characterised by incidents of domestic abuse on both sides fuelled by alcohol without any regard to the emotional or physical wellbeing of PN.  I found that both parents failed to prioritise PN&#8217;s emotional needs and failed to ensure a safe home environment.</p>

The mother does not accept the court&#8217;s findings in relation to the injuries sustained by PN.  Indeed, she continues strenuously to dispute those findings.  Whilst she goes someway to accept that she caused PN emotional harm, she places the blame for that outcome squarely on her decision to continue her relationship with the father rather than acknowledging any deficits on her own part.  By contrast, the father accepts the findings of the court in their entirety. </p>

She has two children of her own who she has parented appropriately.  There is no suggestion that either of her children have come to harm.  During the course of her own assessment she is considered to have worked well with social care professionals.  There are no concerns regarding drug or alcohol misuse.  She was assessed during observations of her parenting to be a confident, patient and understanding parent of children who appear to be leading happy lives.  Her children were comfortable in her presence. She has a well-established relationship with PN and has demonstrated unwavering commitment to these proceedings, in which she has represented herself during a ten-day fact finding hearing and at this hearing in a diligent, measured and considered manner.  Her wish to care for PN has likewise been unwavering as has her commitment to contact with PN. Further, and importantly, as I have already related, the maternal aunt does not advance herself as a sole carer for PN but seeks to care for PN with her partner.  </p>

For example, the prohibition on leaving PN &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">alone</span>&#8221; with the mother does not make clear whether supervision has to be one-to-one at all times or simply involves DA and HA being in the same property as the mother.  The agreement is also confused in its description of precisely who is bound by it as between DA and HA.  The omission of DA and HA must be understood in this context.  Second, it is important to remember the very difficult position family members are placed in when they are asked by a local authority to supervise a parents&#8217; contact with their child.  For family members that task is freighted with complex feelings of love and loyalty as well as a desire to ensure the child is protected.  Within this context, the task facing family members is, paradoxically, a far more difficult one than that which faces professionals trained to undertake it&#8230;Whilst the assessments of DA and HA remain to be finalised, and without in anyway seeking to suggest what the final outcome of these proceedings may be, the local authority will need to consider the conduct of HA and DA within the context of the matters I have outlined.&#8221;</p>

Due to the demands on my list, I am not now able to accommodate a further final hearing until the end of November 2017.  That is simply too long for PN to wait for a final decision.  In circumstances where the Designated Family Judge for Liverpool is able to accommodate a final hearing at the end of May 2017, which will allow for the completion of the further assessments that I am satisfied are necessary, I shall re-allocate this case to Her Honour Judge De Haas QC for a further IRH and final hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In conclusion, I adjourn the final hearing and grant the maternal aunts application for a further assessment of her and her partner by an independent social worker. I direct of my own motion that a further assessment of the paternal great aunt and her husband by be undertaken by an independent social worker.  I direct that the local authority fund both of those assessments.  I re-allocate this case to the Designated Family Judge for Liverpool and will give directions timetabling the matter towards an IRH before Her Honour Judge De Haas QC in mid May 2017 and a final hearing at the end of May 2017.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, the serious mistakes made by East Cheshire Borough Council in this case are of very real concern and must not be repeated.  In the circumstances, as I stated at the beginning of this judgment, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to publish an anonymised version of this judgment on Bailii.  I am further satisfied that it is appropriate to direct the Head of Service for Children&#8217;s Social Care at Cheshire East Borough Council, Mr Nigel Moorhouse, to file and serve a statement explaining to the court precisely how the highly regrettable mistakes that I have recounted in this judgment came to be made and the steps that the local authority intends to take to ensure that they are not repeated in the future.</p>
