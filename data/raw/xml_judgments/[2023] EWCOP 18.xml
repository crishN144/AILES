The Health Board solely commissions the care of HH, who is AH&#8217;s wife. The Local Authority is also the Supervisory Body in respect of the standard authorisations which authorise the deprivation of liberty of both AH and HH. The first hearing listed before me in respect of both of these cases was on 19 December 2021. That hearing was specifically listed before me in order to determine:</p>

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quotes" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;HH presently lives in a care home with her husband sharing a bedroom although with access to separate bathrooms if they wish to spend some time apart. HH lacks capacity and is deprived of her liberty under the package of care she received at the care home and is subject to section 21A proceedings [Case No: 13617222]. It is understood that her husband, AH, also lacks capacity and is subject to section 21A proceedings [Case No: 13752178] although Hywel Dda University Health Board does not share his care and is not a party to the proceedings concerning him. Both spouses are parties within each other&#8217;s proceedings. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quotes" style="margin-left:0.79in">The case has been listed before a tier 3 judge because the litigation friend of HH, and possibly also AH, considered that the proceedings should be consolidated before the same judge at the same time by the same judge. Hywel Dda University Health Board objected to the consolidation of proceedings on the basis that a judge in this situation could not fulfil this dual role as he risks being conflicted if the best interests of the two Ps did not happen to coincide.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Health Board&#8217;s position was that they object to the consolidation of two sets of proceedings or for them to be listed concurrently before the same judge at the same time as wrong in principle. The Health Board made it clear that, for the avoidance of any doubt, they did not dispute that the Court of Protection Rules, mirroring the Civil Procedure Rules, allow for the consolidation of proceedings or to hear two or more applications on the same occasion and that it is for the Court to consider whether this course is appropriate.</p>

The application was supported on behalf of AH, represented by Ms Burnham, and as a matter of jurisdiction and/or principle was opposed by the Health Board.</p>

I am bound to say that, in spite of the erudite and extensive legal argument put forward by Mr Hallin on behalf of the Health Board in this case, it may be that the reason that there are no reported decisions about this issue is because the answer is actually fairly obvious and that this is a point that has not been taken before for that reason. </p>

It is pertinent that I should record that HH is not a party to AH&#8217;s proceedings and that she is not eligible therefore for legal aid for such purposes. This means that her litigation friend is not funded by any public body for these proceedings. AH is a party to HH&#8217;s proceedings, but his litigation friend is compelled to act on a voluntary basis as no legal aid is available. </p>

Whilst technically the Health Board may not be an arm of the state, to all right minded people I venture to suggest that a publicly funded NHS body is exactly that. I find it hard to imagine that the legislators intended that people in these circumstances should be without public funding. I wish to acknowledge the Court&#8217;s gratitude to those who have acted pro bono in this case.</p>

In March 2020, she was admitted to hospital following a fall at home having hit her head. On admission, her ethanol levels were found to be extremely high, and she was noted to be aggressive and highly agitated while in hospital and initially needed intramuscular sedation.</p>

The couple were described as very private and they lived in a rural location. It seems to be agreed that alcohol played a large part in this couple&#8217;s life for the entirely of their marriage of over 50 years. I am told, and accept, that neither AH nor HH recognised that they had any alcohol problems. Both AH and HH have been diagnosed with cognitive impairment. AH has been diagnosed with dementia and HH has been diagnosed with alcohol related brain damage. </p>

As I said during the course of discussions in court again this morning, it cannot be at all easy for her to be pitted, as it were, not necessarily against, but alongside extremely experienced lawyers in Court of Protection, whilst at the same time having to cope with the emotional difficulty of addressing me and, of course, all of the lawyers in respect of her parents&#8217; marriage. It must be distressing for anybody such as her to witness the deterioration of her parents in the way that I have described.</p>

However, I note the evidence has been put forward and accept for the purposes of this decision that I am making now as at least possible that the assertions will all be made out. It has been reported that, following the admission of HH to hospital, AH would attend under the influence of alcohol and would bring in concealed alcohol for HH. I am told that there was an occasion when the police had to attend their matrimonial home following HH&#8217;s admission to hospital because AH was threatening to commit suicide. Following this, AH was sectioned under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> and detained in hospital and the detention was converted into a section 3 detention, and, as a result, AH was in hospital for a long time. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">It is accepted by everybody that a trial of the husband and wife together and sharing a bedroom at B Care Home started in June 2021. I am told that this trial was largely a success, albeit with some incidents of concern. Fast forwarding for a moment to today, which is the end of February 2023, unfortunately a number of episodes have taken place evidencing what seems to be a deterioration particularly in the husband&#8217;s condition and they are at the moment not living together, not at the same home and not seeing each other. That, as I suggested to the parties this morning when we started, brings into sharp focus the argument being put forward by Mr Hallin about the difficulty of one judge making a best interests decision in respect of a couple who may have different best interests subject to which, of course, I am going to return.</p>

I am told and I accept for the purposes of this application that both husband and wife have repeatedly expressed a wish to live together. Again, fast forwarding from the December 2021 proceedings and the November 2022 proceedings to today, the end of February 2023, I am told that AH often asks about his wife but that his wife does not say very much about him unless she is expressly asked to say something about him, but I am clear that it is obvious for the purposes of these proceedings that the couple had repeatedly expressed a wish to live together. Given that they have spent almost the entirely of their adult lives together, that is unsurprising. I can imagine that, whilst there may be some downsides to them living in a shared arrangement, splitting them up could have had catastrophic effects on one or both of them.</p>

For the purposes of this Judgment, I do not need to set out the particular issues affecting each of them. I accept that it is possible, without making any findings, that there may have been occasions when AH was aggressive towards HH, that AH may have been aggressive towards other residents at B Care Home and that there have been challenges presented in respect of the delivery of care to both of them but particularly to HH in AH&#8217;s presence and that he may well have attempted to prevent members of staff from assisting her with personal care and medication.</p>

Both AH and HH&#8217;s representatives asked for the two applications to be heard on the same occasion by the same judge. No one now is suggesting that I should consolidate proceedings but they are suggesting, that is everyone is suggesting except for the Health Board, that I should, as the allocated judge, hear the applications in respect of both AH and HH so I do not need to say anything more about the issue of consolidation. There may well be later issues that would need to be determined in respect of one of the couple rather than the other and it is obviously inappropriate for me to consolidate, and as I say I do not say anything further about that.</p>

It does not, he says, provide for any mechanism for balancing the interests of more than one individual. There is, he says, no ambiguity about this. There is no proper basis, he says, for reading this section down or qualifying this provision in any way so as to allow best interests between two Ps to be balanced or compromised. To do so, he says, offends the plain meaning rule of statutory interpretation, and in this regard he refers me to the familiar proposition set out in Halsbury&#8217;s Laws of England:</p>

He says that, taking these hypothetical cases as examples, the procedurally correct way to deal with the cases of this nature is that the application should be heard by two separate judges to avoid the risk of conflict, with the husband and wife having representation in each other&#8217;s proceedings. He says that even if contrary to the above, the view was that there would be a practical way for an experienced judge to balance two Ps best interests.

Ms Burnham says that on the Health Board&#8217;s argument, the Court would still be required to stand in the shoes of more than one person as part of a decision making process in which it is only capable of standing in the shoes of one. </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">I agree with the submissions made by Mr Hadden, on behalf of HH, that any proposal that AH&#8217;s case could be resolved without his wife also being joined as a party would be plainly wrong. I agree that this also raises issues of fairness, natural justice and compliance with article 6 ECHR. I also agree with Mr Hadden that any proceedings which effectively excluded HH as a party would also raise concerns about whether this would represent an unjustified interference with their rights under article 8 ECHR. Mr Hadden submits that the practical difficulties identified in these cases serve to highlight why the Court should direct that the case should be heard together not separately or consecutively. I agree with that submission.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">Accordingly, I am not in any doubt at all that it is not only possible for one judge to make a best interests decision in respect of each of these two Ps, but it is plainly right, in this case, that that judge should do so. I have canvassed with the parties today the question of whether I should now remit this case back to a lower tier level having made this determination, but the parties all agree with my suggestion, at least at the moment, that this case should remain with me, particularly given the amount of time that I have now spent with it. I entirely accept that, having heard this Judgment, Mr Hallin and his team may wish to reconsider that issue but for the time being at least this case will remain allocated to me and today&#8217;s order will reflect that. Obviously, I accept that Mr Hallin and his team will now need time to consider the implications of what I have said in this judgment, and they may or may not make any applications in due course.</p>
