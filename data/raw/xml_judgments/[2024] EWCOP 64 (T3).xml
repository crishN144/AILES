This is simply not the case.  The safeguarding concerns originated from the hospital where any number of different staff reported DA&#8217;s concerning behaviour towards her mother.  These complaints then continued via the care agency.  The social work team have primarily gathered the information together to get a picture of the relationship and the way this elderly lady is treated by her daughter.  </span></p>

I was particularly conscious that DA has recently been diagnosed with a serious medical condition and may want to speak to her mother privately about this. Nevertheless I accepted NCC&#8217;s and the Official Solicitor&#8217;s argument that DA would use private phone calls to pressurise her mother as she had done in the past.  Likewise, I directed that all telephone calls between CA and EA should be supervised, at least for the time being and until Professor Dubrow-Marshall (see below) has reported. </span></p>

The injunctive directions which were discussed by the parties and for the most part agreed would protect CA from further physical and emotional harm.  These were a proportionate response to the risks CA faces.  </span></p>
