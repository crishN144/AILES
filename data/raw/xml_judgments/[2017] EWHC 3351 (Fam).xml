	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the parents &#8211; the human beings &#8211; involved, these cases, in which they had never expected to become embroiled, are of fundamental importance. Without ever losing sight of that human reality, however, and acutely conscious, as I am, of the stress, worry and anxiety burdening parents in such cases, and of the powerful human emotions that are inevitably engaged, each of these cases is, from a legal perspective, straight-forward and simple. As we shall see, they raise no new point of principal, and I can therefore be brief. Although they are entirely distinct, involving different clinics, it is convenient to deal with both cases in a single judgment. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;That there has been a mistake in this case in the completion of the Form WP is obvious, for the very purpose of completing the form is to give the consent indicated by the placing of a &#8730; in the relevant box. And it is plain what was meant. After all, Form WP is headed &#8220;Your consent to your partner being the legal parent.&#8221; What did Y think she was doing when she completed and signed the Form WP, if not to give her &#8220;consent to [her] partner being the legal parent&#8221;? The answer is obvious: by signing the Form WP she intended to and believed she was giving that consent. The only defect in the completed document is &#8230; a simple undetected clerical error. In the present case &#8230; this obvious mistake can, in my judgment, be &#8216;corrected&#8217; as a matter of construction, and without the need for rectification.&#8221;</p>

Her partner signed a Form PP, at the appropriate time and in the proper form, except that she dated sections 4 and 5 with her date of birth rather than the date on which she signed it. That this was a mistake is obvious, as is the &#8216;correction&#8217; required to remedy the mistake, for the correct date, established by the evidence, is that on which both the Form WP and the Form IC were signed. (I note in passing that the precise date is not material; what is vital is that the form was signed, as I am satisfied it was, before the treatment.)&#8221;</p>

It is clear from all of the documents provided by the clinic that the only parties involved in the treatment here were X and Y. There is no evidence that S had knowledge of or consented to the treatment. On the contrary, X and Y are clear in their witness statements that S was wholly unaware of what was going on. It is clear that there is no basis on which the court could conclude that S consented. In fact it has been shown that he did not consent. That concludes the matter.
