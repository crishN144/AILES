	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">These proceedings concern (A) who is 14 years of age and his brother (B) who is 12 years. A has complex health and social care needs. The most serious aspect of his condition relates to quadriplegic cerebral palsy. He is fed through a Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG), he experiences epileptic seizures and delayed swallowing. He is unable to communicate verbally but can do so in other ways. A has severe cortical visual impairment and significant learning needs. None of this however eclipses his vibrant, gentle and kind personality. It is plain to me that A inspires all whom he comes in to contact with, not least his parents and younger brother. B is also an impressive young man, he is polite and respectful to everybody he encounters and he has been a great support to his mother. I am told that B has a good sense of humour. He enjoys school and is doing well with his studies. It is obvious from his last meeting with the Guardian that he is feeling the strain of these proceedings.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I first encountered this family in proceedings instigated by the mother which were motivated to achieve adaptations in the family home which would enable A to live there in a way that promoted his physical capabilities most effectively and respected his dignity. The Local Authority were dilatory in meeting the raft of statutory obligations that require them to address A&#8217;s needs. The mother was simply not prepared to allow her son to be neglected or marginalised. Though she had tried to care for A, with very little support, she was ultimately physically unable to do so. In consequence A had been placed in a temporary residential unit where he has remained, in an unplanned way, for far too long. He was placed there on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2017. He became a &#8220;looked after child&#8221; on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2017. This unit, is, all agree, staffed and managed by people of outstanding commitment and talent.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">They have provided a space in which A has been able to blossom and reveal a great deal of his potential. This placement has been complimented by the support of a school which has been equally successful in developing A&#8217;s talents. A&#8217;s father, in particular, is fulsome and generous in his praise and thanks for everything the school has achieved for his son. Marvellous though all this has been, A has not been at home. He fervently wishes to be so. He is entitled to be at home, he has a right to be and it is profoundly sad that this has not happened.  Much of the delay has been due to the bureaucratic sclerosis that has dogged the Local Authority, a great deal of it relating to the allocation of funding. The mother has been unyielding in her pursuit of adaptations to the home that give A exactly what he needs. In the litigation the mother considered that this court had been helpful to her in achieving her objectives. After a long battle the mother did, finally, achieve the adaptations to the home that she had sought. The mother was, rightly, proud of what she had achieved for her son. The cost of the project exceeded &#163;340,000. The mother was obviously delighted by the outcome indeed, she had invited me to see the home and meet A when he finally returned to them. I had indicated that I would visit and hoped to be able to do so.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I should record that the parent&#8217;s marriage had broken down in circumstances of mutual recrimination and considerable acrimony. Indeed, there were allegations of verbal and domestic abuse which led to the police being called on two occasions. On the second of these, the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2018, the parents both made allegations of assault against the other. By this time the father had moved out of the home but was </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is right to say that the father has recently impressed all those who have met with him to investigate this case. His love for his children is deep and manifest. What I found particularly striking about his evidence was the extent to which A&#8217;s disabilities were barely considered by the father to be anything other than a practical need. The father sees only his son&#8217;s personality, temperament and ability. He barely notices A&#8217;s disabilities. This is not because he ignores them or seeks to wish them away, it is because they are, for him, only a very tiny part of who his son is. I found the father&#8217;s evidence to be both moving and insightful. It is also obvious from everything else I have read that A&#8217;s relationship with his father is spontaneous, warm and loving. It is striking, therefore, that the father took no real part in the litigation directed against<span style="color:#FF0000"/>the Local Authority to provide suitable and necessary adaptation to the home. When the father did appear, on a couple of occasions in the early hearings, he was profoundly angry and to a degree which he could neither conceal nor wholly control. Indeed, his behaviour in court was only just within the bounds of acceptable. That it stayed within those bounds struck me as requiring very considerable effort on his behalf.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The father who I have described above and the man who I am describing at the earlier hearings are not easy to reconcile. At this hearing the father was measured, courteous, reflective and, as I have set out, impressive in his insight in to A&#8217;s needs. It is also important to identify that he was equally in tune with B. It became clear that they had an easy, open and warm relationship with each other. This is a relationship that has survived the breakdown of the parental relationship and, it seems to me, reasonable to infer that this is most likely to have been achieved in consequence of the parent&#8217;s ability to work effectively with each other, on a practical level, following their separation. Both parents are courteous and respectful to each other. They spontaneously pay tribute to each other strengths and I have no doubt that this is authentic.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The father&#8217;s anger in those earlier hearings undoubtedly stems from his frustration with the Local Authority&#8217;s delays and shortcomings. There are many occasions when the father&#8217;s irritations have been ventilated trenchantly and unambiguously to members of the Local Authority staff and in email correspondence. It is easy to understand why the father might behave in this way and by no means difficult to empathise with the depth of his frustration. It does not, however, justify some of his behaviour. It is, in my view, important that he acknowledges this in the future, if only to himself. As the Guardian has pointed out, A will require the support of social services for the rest of his life. That support is only likely to be effectively delivered, if his parents and family are able to work constructively with them.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Sometimes it needs to be highlighted that people go in to social work to do good. It is a simple fact that many social workers carry caseloads that are far too heavy; they are sometimes given inadequate guidance by their line managers and they have, particularly in recent years, been operating in circumstances where resources of all kinds have become depleted. Inevitably, they will get things wrong. Some will simply lack the degree of skill and ability that is required but overwhelmingly they do their best. They are entitled, if nothing else, to common courtesy.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Unfortunately, the situation here got to such a pass that the social services declined to speak or meet with the father. I am not convinced that was a proportionate response or a sensible one. It created difficulties of a different kind and contributed, in due course, to the Local Authority making some fundamental errors in which they fell considerably short of their obligations to safeguard and protect the children subject to these proceedings. It is not in any way inconsistent with what I have said above to expect social workers to exercise a degree of robustness with parents who are anxious, distressed and frightened for their child&#8217;s future. A temporary restriction or cessation of communication, perhaps viewed as a &#8216;cooling off&#8217; period, may well have been appropriate but cutting the father out to the extent they did gives the appearance of petulance. It creates the impression that the welfare of the staff is regarded as having greater value than the welfare of the child.  It is encouraging that both the Local Authority and the parents recognise the need for independent professional help to achieve better understanding and reconciliation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Though she presents as strong and articulate it has become clear that the mother is vulnerable and deeply insecure. In July 2018 an anonymous phone call was made to the Local Authority informing them that CC was in a relationship with the mother. CC is a Schedule 1 sex offender who, at the time the relationship commenced, had been released on licence, having served the custodial term of a prison sentence for sexual offences relating to his daughter. In addition, CC    had been convicted of possession of an indecent photograph of a child (his daughter). The circumstances of the offence are that CC tickled his daughter, pulling down her knickers and tickling her thighs. Forensic examination of a USB stick, discovered at the home of the child&#8217;s mother revealed indecent images of the girl&#8217;s vagina, photographed underneath the bed clothes whilst she was asleep. The depositions reveal CC &#8217;s daughter to have been profoundly traumatised by the betrayal. In addition to his sentence the Court imposed upon CC a 10-year sexual harm prevention order; restricting his use of spy wear equipment; prohibiting any contact with his daughter without the consent of her mother and social services and preventing contact with any children under 16 unless their parent/guardian is aware of the conviction and consents to the contact. The relationship with CC has been the mother&#8217;s undoing. She has consistently concealed the depth and extent of the relationship and has lied unembarrassedly and convincingly to the social services and to the Court about the extent of her contact with him.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is an alarming feature of this case that the Local Authority failed, in the initial stages, fully to appreciate the significance of the risk CC posed. I regret to say that social services failed in any way adequately to assess the information that was at their disposal, or easily attainable, in order to conduct a professional risk assessment. There appears to have been a collective professional amnesia in respect of the good practice established in evaluating the risk of child sexual abuse, gathered over the last 30 years. Mr Perkins asserts that the deficiencies identified in this team are not representative of practice in this Local Authority&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Services more generally. I profoundly hope that is correct. The Guardian was driven to conclude, and I agree, that this team simply lost sight of the most basic of child protection and safeguarding procedures.  </p>

In some circumstances that will cast no light on either the threshold criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (CA) nor assist in identifying where the children&#8217;s future welfare interests lie. In this case, however, it would, in my judgement, fail to do justice either to the mother or to the family more generally if I declined the invitation. Indeed, it strikes me as necessary to review the Local Authority&#8217;s actions in order fully to understand the present realities for this family. Additionally, though child protection failings of this magnitude are, happily, very rare they require to be identified when they arise. Moreover, the mother&#8217;s response to CC must also be set in the context of the Local Authority&#8217;s own supine reaction to the danger all now recognise he presents. Additionally, the Local Authority&#8217;s failure to alert the father to CC &#8217;s continued presence has to be understood by those who will be charged with the challenge of resurrecting the social work/parent relationship. In part but only, in my judgement, to a relatively small degree, I consider the mother&#8217;s ambivalence in her reaction to CC was reinforced by the fundamentally flawed approach taken by the social services. As is, I suspect already plain from what I have said, I am at a complete loss to understand how the Local Authority went so woefully adrift. I encouraged Ms Kelly to explore this and in response to Ms Kelly&#8217;s examination in chief, the Guardian, made the following observations: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">At the hearing in July the question of a risk assessment was canvassed. I was, to say the least, surprised that the Local Authority were resistant to such a course and wanted to proceed with the return of A to a home where the involvement of a Schedule 1 Child Sex offender had not been subject to any real professional scrutiny. The Guardian, who was present at the hearing and shared my views, recalls, and I accept her accuracy, that I described the Local Authority&#8217;s position as a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;dereliction of responsibility&#8221;</span>. I do not resile from that phrase indeed, the evidence to support it can now properly be described as compelling. What is also important to emphasise is </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I have worked very carefully through this litany of failure. It is a tribute to Ms Kelly&#8217;s industry and skill that it is set out so carefully and concisely. The above paragraphs however, also illustrate the volume and extent of the mismanagement of the case over many months. There is simply no defence to it nor, in their evidence, did the service manager or the social worker<span style="color:#FF0000"/>offer anything that came close to an understanding or explanation of how things came to go so badly wrong. I am able to accept these submissions so extensively and without revision or amendment largely because no coherent defence or explanation has been offered. In my view, there can be none. In her evidence<span style="color:#FF0000"/>the social worker sought to apportion blame or responsibility either to her manager (who has since left) or to her legal department. It may be that both share some responsibility for what has happened here. But none of that avoids the inevitable conclusion that there was a root and branch failure of social work.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The social work failures are, in isolation, concerning. Cumulatively, they are profoundly troubling. They signal, to my mind, a need for significant retraining. I hesitate to identify any particular failure as being the most grave or indeed the most conspicuous but the failure to inform the father of CC&#8217;s involvement in his son&#8217;s lives both initially in the late spring of 2019 and again in January 2020 defies comprehension. It is not only a breakdown in understanding of the fundamental principles of child protection, it is active discrimination towards a father. It is disrespectful to him and it is at least arguable that it is inconsistent with the Article 8 rights of either the children or the father. Ms Budden raises this point in her written submissions and is correct to do so. Her objectives were pragmatic, conceived as a tactical effort to address some of the practical difficulties posed by the significant rental arrears on the renovated property which, I note, was formerly the family home. Those considerations have now fallen away and I do not consider it necessary or indeed appropriate to resolve this Article 8 point, or any question of damages, at this juncture.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Serious though these failings are they do not eclipse the mother&#8217;s responsibility for her own behaviour, Mr Perkins, on behalf of the Local Authority, submits that the mother revealed herself during the course of the hearing to be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;an accomplished liar&#8221;</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;skilled equivocator&#8221;. The </span>mother is, all agree, an intelligent and articulate woman. Both before me, prior to this hearing, and in the assessments, she has been very clear in her articulation of the risk CC    presents to both children. In particular, she has recognised A&#8217;s extreme vulnerability. Her consistent deception about her ongoing relationship with CC    has to be placed in this context. I agree with Mr Perkins that the mother&#8217;s assertion that she was encouraged by a previous social worker to seek out CC    in order that she could achieve &#8220;closure&#8221; is highly unlikely. It is undoubtedly the case that the mother lied about her relationship with CC emphatically to the police in July 2018 and to the social services in August 2018. In September 2018, having been driven to acknowledge the relationship, the mother claimed it had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;finished&#8221;</span> and that she had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;no intention of resuming it.&#8221;</span></p>

The </span>mother&#8217;s description of it in this way is, to my mind, designed to shift responsibility to the Local Authority and away from herself. It is important that the mother appreciates that my criticism of this Local Authority does not provide a safe haven for her to hide from her own manifest failure to protect her boys. A has now lost the opportunity to live permanently at home with his family in a building that has been expertly adapted to enable him to enjoy as much freedom as possible. It is abundantly clear that this is what A wanted most in the world. It is a tragic irony that A&#8217;s mother, who fought so hard and for so long to achieve this real opportunity is herself responsible for destroying it. This is something she will have to carry with her. She was repeatedly warned by the social services and by this Court as to the danger that CC presented. At a meeting in which her McKenzie friend was present, on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2019, the mother articulated a clear awareness of the consequences were she to remain in contact with CC.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is important to emphasise that CC&#8217;s contact with the mother and with both her boys (as is now acknowledged) occurred very shortly after his release on licence. The contact involved CC making a visit with the mother to A&#8217;s school and later to a hospital<span style="color:#FF0000"/>at which A was receiving inpatient treatment. Manifestly, there were very vulnerable children in both places. CC is a man who had never been to prison before and who had caused his own daughter the most acute distress. His experience of custody will have been challenging as a sexual offender against children. On any view one would have thought that he would have gone to great lengths to comply with the terms of his release. The arrogance of this breach of licence and its persistence signals, to me, a man who is lacking in empathy and whose actions are entirely inconsistent with remorse. All this indicates to me that CC continues to present a live, ongoing, high risk to the sexual security of any child. Moreover, it is entirely clear that CC was told in unequivocal terms, by his own sister, that his relationship with the mother was not acceptable and in breach of his licence.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Following the anonymous referral, which resulted in CC&#8217;s recall to prison, the mother filed a statement for the Court stating that she had ceased all contact with him. On his release from prison CC had the mother&#8217;s first name tattooed on his ring finger. The mother met with CC at a coffee house in late August 2018, she claimed, in order to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;achieve closure&#8221;.</span> In fact, she returned CC&#8217;s compliment and had his first name tattooed on her wedding ring finger sometime, in my judgement, later that month. To the extent that she contends that this was done before, I reject her evidence as false. She has made no effort to conceal the tattoo or have it removed or altered in any way.  </p>

Her criticisms of the social workers were, at times, incoherent. Though she had appeared confident and articulate in the past, she struck me as having very low self-esteem and a preoccupation with her own physical appearance.

Moreover and, significantly, she told me that the reality was that she had pursued CC and had done so because she was disturbed that he was no longer interested in her. In relation to a meeting when the mother went to Wales with CC for the day, she now volunteered that she had engineered the trip. She also volunteered that she had gone out of her way to invite CC to her house on the night he was discovered by the police officer. In the light of all this and for the avoidance of any doubt, I do not think the discovery of CC in the house on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2019 was wholly fortuitous, representing an isolated occasion. I think it far more likely that CC visited the home more regularly. Equally, I suspect that the meeting of CC and the mother on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019 may not have been an isolated event. I do not consider it would be safe to regard it as such simply because the mother says so.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It struck me that there came a point when the mother&#8217;s evidence had become so distorted that she had no sense of the impression she was creating. Ironically, it was at this point that her evidence was most convincing. Not only did she volunteer that she had pursued CC but she described a continuing <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;sexual tension&#8221;</span> between them even extended to the December meeting at McDonalds. It needs to be identified, very clearly, that this is an entirely different position to the one presented by the mother to those who have been assessing her. It also requires to be identified that in the chaotic and disorganised thinking that characterised her evidence when she was recalled, she continued to cling on to some concept of &#8220;closure&#8221;. She was never really able to articulate what she meant by that or why, given the disintegration of her life and her plans for A, it still remained so important to her.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As I have stated, I first encountered this mother when she was battling to get her home adapted for the return of her son. It is sadly now quite impossible to contemplate a return of A to his mother&#8217;s care, in the light of the compelling evidence of her inability to protect him. That failure extends to B who both the Guardian and the Local Authority consider would not be sufficiently protected by her. I agree.  </p>

One possibility is that B should move in to his father&#8217;s flat, which is comfortable but too small for both of them on a long-term basis. A would remain in residential care in his present unit and at his present school. The alternative is that the </p>

On this arrangement the mother would be able to visit, with the father sensitively and unobtrusively monitoring her contact. Both the Guardian and the Local Authority prefer this latter option. In his evidence the fathers struck me as enthusiastic about it, though I find the written submissions, advanced on his behalf, rather more cautious, no doubt arising from the anxiety regarding the extensive rent arrears. The mother would prefer a solution, contemplated by Dr Garrett, which envisaged tailored therapeutic counselling work. This would involve an adjournment of these proceedings for six months.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The mother has already been extensively assessed in this case by Dr Anna Gupta, Ms Becky Scott and Dr Tanya Garrett. Dr Garrett provided an extensive and thorough psychological report based on having spent 13 hours with the mother. Dr Gupta&#8217;s assessment of the mother was kindly but heavily dependent on reportage from the mother. To her credit Dr Gupta acknowledged this. She told me that, in her view, the options are so <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;bleak&#8221; </span>for A that she wanted to do anything she could to avoid him <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;spending the rest of his life in an institution.&#8221;</span> Though well motivated this approach is not a satisfactory substitute for the analysis and reasoning that the situation requires. Ultimately, Dr Gupta was attracted to Dr Garrett&#8217;s suggestion that there could perhaps be a 6-month structured therapeutic piece of work helping the mother to understand and address her underlying vulnerabilities. Becky Scott also deferred to this suggestion. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In cross-examination Mr Perkins referred to CC as a &#8216;paedophile&#8217;. Ms Scott corrected him. CC, she said, was not a paedophile as that expression is only apt to cover those whose sole sexual interest is in children. Ms Scott considered that as CC has a sexual interest in adult women the label paedophile should not be used. The Guardian did not recognise the nicety of this distinction, nor did she accept a diluted risk to male children. The Guardian was plainly unimpressed by Ms Scott&#8217;s evidence and the approach to the case in her report. I consider that Ms Scott&#8217;s approach was lacking in forensic curiosity. I agree with Mr Perkins that it is very odd that she did not question the mother as to the symbolism and significance of CC&#8217;s name tattooed on her ring finger. Additionally, I can see no basis in evidence for such a benign interpretation of CC&#8217;s offending. I cannot see on what evidential premise Ms Scott appears to discount CC&#8217;s behaviour towards his daughter as unlikely to be grooming nor do I regard the furtive videoing of his daughter&#8217;s vagina with a pen camera to be accurately characterised as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;thrill seeking behaviour which is not indicative of a high degree of sophistication or manipulation&#8221;.</span> It struck me that Ms Scott had ultimately been unable objectively to assess the evidence in this case. Accordingly, I am unable to place any reliance on her conclusions. Moreover, I consider what I regard as a minimising of CC&#8217;s offending and consequent flawed analysis of risk will have sent confusing messages to the mother. Again, I emphasise that none of this eclipses the mother&#8217;s own responsibility, she, after all, has been able to articulate the risk CC represents, though she has been unable to disentangle herself from him emotionally.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Dr Garrett was, as Ms Kelly highlights in her closing submissions, measured in her conclusions. This was not a case in which she was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;enthusiastic&#8221;</span> about the prospects of therapy but nor did she consider it to be hopeless. As the children&#8217;s Guardian, pointed out, it would have been interesting to have Dr Garrett&#8217;s opinion on the mother&#8217;s evidence. The Guardian was able to give her evidence having seen the mother give hers. Though the Guardian has been vigilant to ensure that the mother got access to appropriate work and help during the course of these proceedings and though I have not the slightest doubt that she remained hopeful throughout that both boys would stay in or return to their mother&#8217;s care, her assessment of the mother&#8217;s evidence was clinical and clear. The mother&#8217;s evidence had led to the Guardian having <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;diminished confidence in the mother&#8217;s protective capacities&#8221;</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"/>she considered the mother&#8217;s credibility to have been fundamentally damaged to a degree that was much greater than that which was already evident. The Guardian had no confidence, at all, in the mother&#8217;s ability to work honestly and openly with the professionals. Crucially, the Guardian did not consider that therapy was likely to have any impact on the mother&#8217;s capacity to be honest with the professionals. She came to the firm conclusion that there were few, if any, positive prognostic indicators suggesting that an extensive period of counselling would be productive. Delay, by contrast, she considered would be inimical to the welfare of both boys. </p>

A has been in a temporary placement that has had to adjust to his permanent needs but was, all agree, for a considerable period not what A required. He has also been deprived of the home life that he so manifestly wanted. Though B has been stoic and phlegmatic, I have no doubt that, as the father suggested, these proceedings will have taken their toll on him. Both these boy&#8217;s interests require a conclusion to these proceedings. If I considered that delay for therapeutic work had any real prospect of being purposeful, I may well </p>

Nothing of what I have said about the mother should detract from her achievements or diminish the contribution that she can and ought to make to her children&#8217;s lives. As it transpired the mother was ultimately, when confronted with the depth of her feelings for CC, unable to prioritise her children&#8217;s needs above her own. I have no doubt that with the father&#8217;s careful scrutiny she can make her contact with them a positive and nurturing experience. </p>

Mr Perkins has addressed me, in writing, on the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/33" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 33</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref>. There is no doubt that these provisions facilitate the transfer of the tenancy of the family home, in the circumstances of this case.  At the time Ms Budden submitted her closing submissions the position in relation to the rent arrears, which were very substantial, was not known and so the father has not made an application. I anticipate an application being made promptly and I hope it will move forward by agreement. </p>
