On the same day, the court made the prohibited steps orders requested without notice to the father. The court gave brief reasons for doing so, namely that the children had lived with the mother since 2019; the mother&#8217;s evidence was that the father had been communicating with B secretly and the messages exhibited tended to suggest that the father is intending to remove B from the mother&#8217;s care and from the jurisdiction; the father&#8217;s Article 6 right to a fair hearing was addressed by the listing of an urgent hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in">Accordingly, the matter came before the court on 13 September 2023 for that urgent hearing. The father agreed to the prohibited steps orders remaining in place and the court also made a port alert order. The application referred to the children&#8217;s [non-British] passports having expired and [the father&#8217;s native country] is not a signatory to the Hague Convention. It was apparent that the father did not accept the allegations made by the mother, and so the court directed evidence and disclosure.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in">On 22 November 2023, the court determined that a fact finding hearing was necessary and proportionate and gave further directions. That was contrary to the recommendations of the child impact report dated 7 November 2023 (this being a Practice Direction 36Z case), which said this:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I do not believe a fact-finding hearing is necessary despite [the father]&#8217;s denial of the allegations made about his abusive and violent conduct within the relationship between him and [the mother].

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in">The court was critical of that recommendation at the time, which it seemed to me rode roughshod over the father&#8217;s Article 6 rights.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in">This is a case in which there are a number of allegations made by the mother, characterised as physical abuse, emotional abuse, and coercive and controlling behaviour. Although the father made allegations against the mother of abuse of him and the children, about the mother&#8217;s mental health and alcohol misuse, his position at the hearing on 22 November 2023 was for her to have care of two of the children. The court therefore determined that it was neither necessary nor proportionate to determine his allegations except for those which were the mirror image of the mother&#8217;s although, as will become clear, the fact that he made the allegations at all has been explored within the hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.49in">Somewhat exceptionally in my experience to date, a QLR had successfully been appointed. However, on the first day of the hearing, the QLR then notified the court that they had been taken ill and could not attend. Even before the decision from the President of the Family Division in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Z (Prohibition on cross examination: no QLR)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2024/22" uk:canonical="[2024] EWFC 22" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2024">[2024] EWFC 22</ref>, I had given directions for the father to file questions to be asked of the mother and her family members within the order of 22 November 2023. However, understandably, he needed time in order to put those together because he had thought until the start of the hearing that a QLR would be assisting him. With his Article 6 rights in mind, I therefore gave a ruling about the issue and the father had the rest of first day of the hearing to prepare written questions which the court could ask of the mother and her other witnesses in case the QLR did not make a recovery. As it was, the QLR did not recover by the second day of the hearing and the court proceeded without her.</p>

When parents live separately, it follows from that that the starting point is that children should remain in contact with the parent that does not administer their day to day care. That starting point is, of course, always subject to the children&#8217;s welfare. Making an order for no direct contact is a serious and draconian order. The court should not do so unless it is satisfied that it is both necessary and proportionate to do so, and that no other less radical form of order will achieve the essential end goal of being in the children&#8217;s welfare interests whilst also promoting the involvement of each parent in their lives.</p>

The father told the court that wearing the hijab was the mother&#8217;s own idea. He accepted that she did not wear it before he met her, that he liked it when the mother wore the hijab, and that he told her it looked nice. He said that the mother researched Islam and that she chose to dress conservatively. He agreed that he liked it when she did dress in that way.</p>

She told the father that she would leave with the children, at which he told her that he would kill her if she were to take the children.

The email is in evidence. The maternal grandmother told her brother about her concerns that the mother has been in a controlling and abusive relationship for five years, that she had thought that she had helped the mother to get away twice after the father threatened to beat her, but that the father had got her back. She said that the mother planned to leave the father again the next day by pretending to take the children to school but catch the train instead. </p>

The father accepted that that is what Social Services had said, but that he was not trying to be controlling. The social workers recorded that the father did not accept that there was a problem. He blamed his mother in law for getting involved, housing and the mother&#8217;s depression. The father said, when asked about that, that both parties were nervous to be talking to Children&#8217;s Services. </p>

In his oral evidence, the father confirmed that, for example, when he perceived that B&#8217;s need were not being attended to, and he referred to things being left for, say, six hours, he described that he would be upset and take those matters up with the mother.</p>

A Domestic Violence Intervention Project (&#8220;DVIP&#8221;) referral was made for the father and the mother. The mother chose not to attend, but the father agreed to do so. He was asked why he needed to attend if he did not think he was the perpetrator of domestic abuse, and he told the court that it was always good to learn more about anger management.

The mother told the court that the father would tell her when she could use the card, and that she would tell the social workers things which were not true in order to keep the peace. Similarly, Social Services recorded that the mother had good contact with the maternal grandmother, and that the children did too. It was put to her that that was inconsistent with her allegation that the father stopped the maternal grandmother from having a relationship with the children.

Although both A and B raised concerns about the father&#8217;s behaviour in the context of a Child In Need meeting on 12 November 2015, A, at least, thought that the father&#8217;s shouting had ceased since she had started the new school year. Brent Children&#8217;s Services, therefore closed the case with an action point that the father engage with the DVIP.</p>

She said in another part of her evidence that she did not know about abuse for years, but could sense that something was wrong. She said she kept trying to do what the mother wanted her to do, which was to keep things calm and not say anything. The maternal grandmother wanted the marriage to succeed because the mother wanted it to. If anything, she said, she did not interfere enough. She wanted her daughter to work things through in the way she wanted to, but her fear of the father and of the unknown seemed to drive her back again and again.</p>

She could not see a way out. She said that she took some responsibility for that, but that she was afraid. She said that she never had a moment to think about how the future might look. She was constantly under the father&#8217;s control, being monitored. He would tell her that her parents did not love her and she believed it.

It is consistent also with the evidence that the maternal grandmother, who was far from being a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;toxic grandmother,&#8221;</span> did not know what to do for the best, which comes across also in the evidence of the maternal aunt and the local authority. They were trying to act sensitively, in order to ensure that they did not lose the mother&#8217;s trust, and in consequence the opportunity to safeguard her and the children.</p>

The matters recorded by the police and Children&#8217;s Services were consistent with the other contemporaneous evidence, and recorded concerns of professionals which naturally flowed from the mother&#8217;s presentation rather than what she was actually saying to them, which was that everything was alright.</p>

It would have required an enormous amount of forward planning and meticulous execution of that plan to create the paper trail, over a period of many years, which the court has before it. It is highly improbable that the mother and her family members would have been motivated to collude to the extent alleged on the off chance that, at some distant point in the future, it may be desirable to deploy a narrative about the father in order to paint him in a bad light in order to restrict contact, even if the complexity of that pretence were likely to ever be achievable. Even if it were possible to orchestrate all of that, it is more likely in my judgment that the mother would have made the allegations immediately post separation, instead of three years later.</p>

Looking at it holistically, it reveals, in my judgment, an escalating picture of abuse and the concern about that from third parties in the period to the summer of 2017. At that point, the scrutiny of the family by Children&#8217;s Social Care, the police, the schools and the maternal family had reached its highest to date. The professionals and those who loved the mother were extremely worried about what life was like for the mother and for the children.</p>

On the evidence before the court, it is more likely than not that that concern was held by the mother because the father made her believe it. The reality was that the maternal family knew, because the maternal aunt had raised it with the maternal grandmother during the first telephone call that she had about the abuse on 2 April 2014, that the local authority may question the mother&#8217;s ability to protect the children if she kept returning to the father. However, their solution to that risk was to act protectively themselves: for example, the maternal grandmother provided a place of safety, the maternal aunt provided measured advice, and both assisted with means of removing the mother and children from the abuse. They were a support network for the mother.</p>

I am satisfied that the family moved there in the summer of 2017, and they moved suddenly, either because the father actively wanted to further isolate the mother from sources of support or because the spotlight being shone on the family was becoming too bright and he was losing control. On balance, the latter is more likely, although I do not need to resolve that issue, and it may be that a bit of both was true.</p>

He accepted that he preferred&#8230; food [from his native country], that, if he did not like the food which the mother cooked, he would ask her to make it again, and that he would insist that the children ate their food even if they did not want to. He appeared to have very exacting standards which he expected the mother to adhere to, and he appeared to be annoyed when giving his evidence about occasions on which he would &#8220;end up&#8221; making food himself, and he responded disproportionately in my judgment to finding yoghurt in the fridge which had gone beyond its expiry date. There is also consistency with what the mother told the police on 8 June 2017 in the context of allegation [1H]. That was all part of his angry and controlling behaviour, in my judgment. What the father accepts is consistent with the mother&#8217;s evidence about these matters, and I find allegations [2E and 2G] proven.</p>

In my judgment, he showed no real sympathy for C&#8217;s position when he gave his evidence.

To that extent, allegation [2A] is proven. When I ask myself why the father preferred the mother to dress in that way, on balance I accept what is alleged by the mother about the father being unhappy if she was seen by other men. The idea that the mother only <span style="font-style:italic">wanted</span> to go out of the house to collect groceries or undertake the school run seems to me to be inherently unlikely, but that the father says that she did not leave the house is consistent with her evidence that the father did not want her associating with men or being seen on the balcony. That, in my judgment, was jealous behaviour consistent with the events in December 2013 in allegation [1C], and not simply the more innocuous position for which the father contends. The incident in July 2014 when the police were called by hospital staff, because the father was out of control, provides further support. Allegation [2F] is therefore proven.</p>

No bank statements have been exhibited in support of the allegation. The father says simply that money was tight, and that he would use the mother&#8217;s bank card when his account did not have enough money in it for whatever he needed. The evidence is that he asked the maternal grandmother for &#163;20,000 at around the time of D&#8217;s birth, and that he had to spend one month in two in the UK in order to supplement the family&#8217;s income. I have inferred that he would not have done so had the family had plenty of income. I am therefore not satisfied that his control of the finances was abusive as opposed to a matter of day to day budgeting.</p>

In fact, the father accepted that he would have benefited from learning about anger management when the DVIP programme referral was made in 2015. The anger management issues are further informed by the findings I make below in relation to physical abuse. The father accepted that some of the words he used at different times in the relationship were abusive.

There was a dispute between the parties as to whether the mother had travelled to England between 2017 and 2020 more often than she accepts she did.

None of the professionals appeared to believe the mother when she withdrew her allegations, and understandably so in my judgment. The maternal grandmother says that the mother would receive a barrage of communications from the father in the immediate aftermath of an allegation having been reported, and that the mother would cave in and return to him. What the mother told the court is that the father made her think that she was to blame, that she was scared of what he would do and of losing the children, and that she could not see a way out.

His evidence has also become internally inconsistent, probably as a result of the mother amending the date of the allegation once the police disclosure was received, in that the reference to the mother being in the bathroom holding 20 tablets in her hand was in 2014, and not prior to this incident.</p>

In my judgment, it is more probable that the mother was upset because the father struck her because he did not like her talking to male doctors than his explanation she had become upset because she thought he would be upset, and that is before I factor in the maternal grandmother&#8217;s evidence that she overheard him telling the mother that she was wrong to have spoken to a man in his absence.

His anger must, in my judgment, have been at high levels given that it was common ground that a total stranger intervened to assist the mother who was crying, and in those circumstances I have inferred that the father&#8217;s demeanour must have been domineering and frightening. Although the mother did not report that the father tried to choke her, nor did she any of the rest of the incident. This was before the mother started to confide in the maternal grandmother, whose evidence in relation to these events is about what she said and heard herself. In my judgment, the mother&#8217;s evidence is to be preferred and I find this allegation [1C] proven.</p>

The father accepts that she locked herself in the bathroom. What the police observed was that the mother was terrified and too frightened to make any allegations. She told them that the father had been angry with her for the events which led to the cautions being administered in July 2011. Nothing appears to have been said at the time about the mother attempting to overdose on tablets.</p>

It is a very unusual form of threat, which bears a striking similarity to what was alleged in the period between 2017 and 2020 when the family lived in [the father&#8217;s native country] [2D].

The police recorded the mother&#8217;s reply to the father in January 2014 that she had not told the police anything, which in my judgment is consistent with him having threatened her and her being frightened of him. Such is the striking similarity of his approach in those situations that I accept also that he would deploy the same approach during the family&#8217;s time in [the father&#8217;s native country], as the mother alleges.

The acrimony which he harbours for the mother was not as evident in the mother&#8217;s evidence about him; indeed, she was willing to positively promote the relationship between the children and the father provided that their safety is secured. Because it was not a welfare hearing, the author of the report has not given evidence, but the court is often told by professional witnesses about the effects of parental conflict on children. That is, that children caught in the centre of their parents&#8217; conflict, will often feel conflicted themselves and that may manifest itself in a number of ways and perhaps not immediately. For example, a child may give mixed messages, telling one parent one thing and then the other something else. On other occasions, a child may align with one parent.</p>
