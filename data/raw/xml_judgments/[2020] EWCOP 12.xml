The order was made by the President of the Irish High Court on the application of the Health Service Executive of Ireland (&#8220;HSE&#8221;). The order authorised the transfer for treatment of SM, a 19-year-old Irish girl, to Ellern Mede Moorgate (&#8220;Ellern Mede&#8221;), a specialist hospital with a high dependency unit in the North-East of England. The consensus before the Irish Court was that SM requires a placement which can stabilise her general mental health before treating her underlying condition. </p>

Neither the question of SM&#8217;s capacity, nor the urgency of treatment, is contentious. However, Mr Setright QC, Mr Ruck Keene and Ms Katherine Barnes, who appear on behalf of the HSE, have invited me to consider and approve the legal framework, both in relation to the transfer and in the context of a proposed &#8216;detailed and structured review&#8217; by the Irish High Court.  </p>

Whilst Ireland has many centres of medical excellence, specialist units, such as the one contemplated here, and more generally concerning the treatment of serious eating disorders, are in short supply. This is one of a number of cases in which similar arrangements have been made.  </p>

SM has been assessed as lacking capacity to consent to or refuse medical treatment. The most recent evidence in this regard is set out in the affidavit of Dr John O&#8217;Mahoney, Executive Clinical Director of the HSE and a specialist psychiatrist, dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2020. Dr O&#8217;Mahoney reports that SM&#8217;s capacity is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;significantly compromised by her disordered thinking so that she is not capable of capacitously agreeing to treatment&#8221;</span>.

SM&#8217;s initial weight gain at Springfield was accompanied by a deterioration in her mental condition. SM is said to experience regular flashbacks and dissociative states.

I am told that although SM does not need to be restrained, it is necessary for several staff members to keep her in position whilst feeding. The reasons for SM&#8217;s deterioration are unclear. It seems the clinicians working with her have speculated that it may be linked to allegations she has made since arriving at Springfield concerning sexual abuse which she asserts that she suffered as a child. Dr Galavotti&#8217;s explains that, over Christmas 2019, SM told her parents that she had been the victim of sustained abuse by an adult when she was a child. Dr O&#8217;Mahoney&#8217;s affidavit also refers to SM having made allegations of a similar complexion during the period of her placement at Springfield. </p>

He also considers there would be no value to extending SM&#8217;s placement at Springfield as she is too unwell to engage with any of the therapies on offer.  </p>

For example, and in addition to SM&#8217;s sustained, repeated attempts to commit suicide, Dr O&#8217;Mahoney refers to SM having to spend extensive periods in a padded room, being unable to tolerate having even a bed (SM&#8217;s father having given evidence that SM had formed a </p>

Consequently, Dr O&#8217;Mahoney explains that he has been urgently investigating an alternative placement for SM and has found what he considers to be a suitable placement for her at Ellern Mede. In summary, this placement is considered appropriate because it offers a high dependency unit akin to psychiatric intensive care. Dr Hind Al-Khairfulla, the Medical Director at Ellern Mede, has assessed SM and agreed to accept her as of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2020. Springfield has agreed to retain care of SM until that date on the strict understanding that SM will be transferred on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2020 without delay.   </p>

SM was represented by Ms Hickey, who continued (and continues) to act as her committee on the basis that SM <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;lacks the capacity to litigate</span>&#8221;. As recorded in the transcript of that hearing, SM&#8217;s parents were fully supportive of the application, as was Ms Hickey. As for SM&#8217;s expressed views, communicated to the court on her behalf by her committee, although she had previously supported a move to Ellern Mede, at the time of the hearing her expressed preference was for an alternative placement in England known as the Schoen Clinic. This was because SM expressed that she felt that the trauma underlying her other difficulties could be effectively treated there. </p>

In so doing, he took express account of SM&#8217;s preference for the Schoen Clinic. However, he found that, unlike Ellern Mede, which was the clinical recommendation of Dr Galavotti and Dr O&#8217;Mahoney, a placement at the Schoen Clinic would not be in her best interests. In a detailed judgment Mr Justice Kelly observes: </p>

This was considered necessary so as to enable this Court to be satisfied that it could take appropriate steps to ensure implementation of the Irish Order. However, given that the current application proposes moving SM away from Springfield, it is no longer thought necessary or appropriate for them to remain as a party. In contrast, the new provider, Ellern Mede, has an obvious interest in the application and thus becomes the Respondent. As such, the Applicant applies to discharge the South West London and St George&#8217;s Health NHS Trust as a party and to join Ellern Mede as a party. I grant both applications. </p>

I do not accept that the Courts of England and Wales should automatically adopt a more cautious approach when asked to recognise and enforce an order of a nonConvention state. Each case will turn on its own facts, to which this Court must apply the provisions of the Schedule, in particular the provisions as to recognition in paragraph 19 including the grounds on which recognition may be refused. &#8230; Given the close similarities between the legal systems of England and Wales and the Republic of Ireland, however, I anticipate that the circumstances in which the Court will find cause to exercise its discretion to refuse to recognise protective measures in orders of the Irish Courts will be rare, notwithstanding the fact that Ireland (like England and Wales) has yet to ratify the Convention</span>.&#8221; </p>

These differences may extend not only to the way in which the individual is treated but also to questions of jurisprudence and capacity. Thus the fact that there are provisions within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that appear to conflict with the laws and procedures of the foreign state should not by itself lead to a refusal to recognise or enforce the foreign order. Given that Parliament has included section 63 and Schedule 3 within the MCA, clearly intending to facilitate recognition and enforcement in such circumstances, it cannot be the case that those other provisions within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that seemingly conflict with the laws and procedures of the foreign state are mandatory provisions of the laws of England and Wales so as to justify the English Court refusing to recognise the foreign order on grounds of such inconsistency. In such circumstances, it is only where the Court concludes that recognition of the foreign measure would be manifestly contrary to public policy that the discretionary ground to refuse recognition will arise. Furthermore, in conducting the public policy review, the Court must always bear in mind, in the words of Munby LJ that &#8216;the test is stringent, the bar is set high&#8217;.</span>&#8221;</p>

The very nature of what has to be established before the competent national authority - that is, a true mental disorder - calls for objective medical expertise. Further, the mental disorder must be of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement. What is more, the validity of continued confinement depends upon the persistence of such a disorder (see, mutatis mutandis, the St&#246;gm&#252;ller judgment of 10 November 1969, Series A no. 9, pp. 39-40, para. 4, and the above-mentioned De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment, p. 43, para. 82).</span>&#8221;  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.04in">Finally, counsel drew to my attention the decision of Mostyn J in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re M [2011] EWHC 3590</span>, which was also concerned with the compulsory placement of an Irish national in an English psychiatric hospital. There Mostyn J concluded that an order recognising and enforcing a foreign measure under Schedule 3 is not a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">welfare order</span>&#8221;, as defined by s.16A(4)(b) MCA. I respectfully agree, as I note did Baker J in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re PA and Others</span>. One of the consequences of this is that the rules relating to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">ineligibility</span>&#8221; in s.16A and Schedule 1A do not apply. Mr Setright properly points out that the consequence of this is that a court may find itself in the position of recognising and enforcing orders of a foreign court which have the consequence of depriving P of his or her liberty in circumstances where this would not be possible under the domestic jurisdiction, under the aegis of the MCA. This might arise, for example, where the Court of Protection is required to recognise and enforce an order where an individual is being treated or is treatable under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> (&#8220;MHA&#8221;), as defined in Schedule 1A MCA. The check on this, however, is provided, in my view, by the discretion the court has, in its review, to refuse recognition and enforcement where the order would be manifestly contrary to public policy. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.04in">Key to understanding why this regime has been effective is that it provides for continuity of personnel. Responsibility for supervising the arrangements has been assumed by the President of the Irish High Court and thus provides not merely judicial continuity, as I have stated, but consistent overview at the very highest level. Additionally, P&#8217;s committee and advocate remain a constant point of contact, not least for the family concerned. It is also apparent that the cases have been allocated regular and, to use the words selected by the Irish High Court in this case, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">intense</span>&#8221; reviews. It is impossible not to recognise strong resonances with the wardship jurisdiction for children that operated in the High Court (Family Division) in England and Wales prior to the introduction of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (&#8220;CA&#8221;). The use of wardship and the inherent jurisdiction in that period was referred to by the Law Commission as a Rolls Royce service, many of the principles of which were incorporated into the CA to afford wider access for children and families to a range of options which had hitherto been confined to cases heard in the High Court.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.04in">The HSE only contemplates placements of adults in this jurisdiction because it considers that the appropriate and necessary facilities are unavailable in Ireland. This requires the broader canvas to be considered. The individual who is being treated, it must be remembered, is not making an autonomous decision to relocate. The entire infrastructure of the adult&#8217;s family life remain in Ireland. The hearings logically are more conveniently held in a court which can be attended by parents and/or family members, in a court process which is not alien to them. A foreign jurisdiction would inevitably increase the anxiety that all lay people feel attending at any court. I am told that SM&#8217;s parents have not missed a single hearing in Ireland and have been afforded the opportunity to address the court at every stage.  </p>

A requirement to participate in an alien jurisdiction would, it is submitted, exacerbate the fear that their family member had been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">abandoned</span>&#8221; in a foreign jurisdiction. Crucially, to my mind, at every review hearing the Irish High Court considers the necessity of the adult&#8217;s ongoing placement abroad and focuses on whether the adult&#8217;s needs may have changed and potentially be met in Ireland. There is an emphasis on the adult returning home as soon as is feasible. Though I am told and accept the fact that the HSE treats the return of the adult to Ireland as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a priority</span>&#8221;, it requires to be recognised that the Irish court retains the authority to compel return where that is considered to be in the adult&#8217;s best interests.  </p>

In the course of addressing this difficult issue, counsel have provided a number of recent examples illustrating swift and effective resolution by the Irish High Court of concerns relating to placements in England and Wales. I do not propose further to burden this already extensive judgment with an analysis of those cases, though I am grateful to counsel for doing so. Schedule 3, of course, provides for recognition of protective measures and, as with a patient detained under the MHA, capacity to consent to treatment is taken into account by the treating team (even though, strictly speaking, it does not need to be).  </p>

I am bound to say I do not read her judgment as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">equating the two concepts</span>&#8221;. However, the point is made here with sufficient force by the assertion that the treating team in England and Wales would, in accordance with good practice, follow the guidance in Chapter 23. The point, it seems to me, is that this is no more or less likely to be followed merely because it is a court of England and Wales rather than a Irish court responsible for overview of the case. Indeed, returning to the point that I have probably laboured too heavily, the frequency and intensity of the reviews by the Irish High Court are most likely to protect the concepts intrinsic to the MCA, many of which were themselves gleaned from the declaratory relief procedure that operated under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court of England and Wales prior to the introduction of the MCA. </p>

However, this guidance properly only relates to restricted patients (i.e. those who are detained by way of a hospital order made by the Crown Court under s.37 MHA as an alternative to a custodial sentence, and are then subject to further restrictions imposed under s.41 MHA, the most relevant of these for present purposes being that the Secretary of State for Justice&#8217;s consent is required for the patient&#8217;s discharge).  There is nothing on the wording of s.86 MHA itself to support the limitation upon the use of s.86 in the case of those who are likely to be discharged within 6 months;    (d)<span style="font-family:Arial"/>Section 86 MHA is silent as to the identity of those entitled to make requests for transfer to the Secretary of State, such that it would be entirely possible for the HSE to make the request at the direction of the Irish High Court (or, indeed, for the request to be made directly by the Irish High Court itself).    </p>
