If, contrary to the finding of the court, Mrs L was deprived of her liberty, this was not to be imputed to the State. This was a shared arrangement set up by agreement with a caring and pro-active family and the responsibility of the State was diluted by the strong role which the family had played and continued to play.</span></p>

If he did attempt to leave, he would be persuaded to return and, if that failed, consideration would be given as to whether a Mental Health Act assessment was necessary, failing which the police would be called in as a last resort.

I agree with Mr Mullins that he is not. First, he is not under constant supervision. He is afforded appreciable privacy. Second he is free to leave. Were he to do so his carers would seek to persuade him to return but such persuasion would not cross the line into coercion. The deprivation of liberty line would only be crossed if and when the police exercised powers under the Mental Health Act. Were that to happen then a range of reviews and safeguards would become operative. But up to that point Ben is a free man. In my judgment, on the specific facts in play here, the acid test is not met. Ben is not living in a cage, gilded or otherwise. &#8230; I therefore declare that Ben is not being deprived of his liberty by virtue of the care package which I approve as being in his best interests.&#8221;</span></p>
