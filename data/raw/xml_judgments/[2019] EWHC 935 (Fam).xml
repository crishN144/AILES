	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">This case concerns RM, a vulnerable young adult man of nineteen who has profound learning disabilities, a citizen of the United States, who presently lives with his father in Texas. Sadly, RM has been the subject of acrimonious litigation between his parents throughout his childhood. Born on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 1999, he is the second of two children; his elder sister NM, was also the subject of the prolonged litigation in the County and Family Courts. In 2006, following a hearing before Her Honour Judge Mayer, a most experienced Family Court Judge, findings were made that their mother (FT), the applicant in these proceedings had been abusive to her children as a result they were removed from her care and placed in the care of their father (MM), the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent in these proceedings.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">The applicant (FT) initiated further litigation in 2011 regarding the arrangements for RM and seeking an order, under the Children Act (CA) 1989, for shared care: those proceedings concluded in 2015 when FT&#8217;s application for shared care was refused and orders were made by Her Honour Judge Mayer (dated 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2015) that RM was to continue to live with his father and FT have limited and supervised contact. In addition, an order was made pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s91(14)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> that neither parent was to make any further applications in respect of RM during his minority without prior permission from the court.  The order of 2006 was subject to an appeal by FT, but the appeal was dismissed; the order 2015 was not the subject of appeal. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">These proceedings, which commenced not long before RM&#8217;s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday, came about because RM was removed from this jurisdiction by his father on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November 2016 to live in the US. The relocation had not been sanctioned by the court and was contrary to the provisions of the order of 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2015. Prior to his removal FT had not, in fact, been taking up contact for some months because she was unwell and so it was not until the end of January 2017 that she discovered that RM was no longer attending his school in London. Police in the UK initiated a &#8220;safe and well&#8221; check by the police in Tampa, Florida, USA. No concerns were raised. RM was then moved to Texas where MM works and continues to live there with his father.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">FT now seeks the implementation of the orders of this Court made since RM&#8217;s removal from the jurisdiction including and specifically orders for RM to be returned to this jurisdiction. The 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent father (MM) has only participated sporadically in the proceedings which FT has continued to pursue, but he has said that he will not bring RM back as he believes it is in his best interests for RM to remain living in the USA. The Official Solicitor (on behalf of RM who lacks capacity) had sympathy for FT as RM&#8217;s mother and had originally supported FT, largely, it has to be said, because so little was known about RM&#8217;s care and circumstances in the USA but now considers that RM should not be brought back to England if not solely then primarily, it would seem, for the purpose of further litigation. By the time of the hearing before me the Official Solicitor (OS) had the opportunity to made enquiries in the USA and has concluded that RM is safe and adequately looked after and that is not in his best interest to be returned.  </p>

The OS accepted the court&#8217;s invitation to act as RM&#8217;s litigation friend in December 2017. At the hearing before me, the applicant (FT) was represented by solicitors and counsel, the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent (MM) represented himself and attended only part of the first day of the hearing by telephone. At one point, to the concern of the court, it became apparent that MM was participating in the hearing on the phone while driving his car and the proceedings halted until he told the court he had stopped driving. Overnight MM provided the court, with the assistance of the office of the OS, with documents from the USA in respect of RM&#8217;s care there and other issues; although some of these had been previously provided. MM did not attend the second day of the hearing. Oral representations were made by both counsel, who also provided written arguments and submissions. The court was provided with a bundle which included documentation from previous proceedings, including the previous judgments of Her Honour Judge Mayer and that of Mr Justice Mostyn. </p>

This being MM&#8217;s deemed application made by virtue of the order of Mr Justice Mostyn at the conclusion of the hearing before him on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2017. (b) that subsequent orders directing RM&#8217;s return, should be varied or discharged; (c) if not, how this court could cause RM to be returned to England and Wales; and (d) the continuation of the freezing order made by Mrs Justice Roberts on 19 December 2017.  Mr Justice Mostyn who had previously dealt with the case and had given the judgment previously referred to on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2017, listed the matter for a hearing on forum. Previously, Mrs Justice Roberts, who had case presided over the matter for over a year, had expressed her concerns about the costs of pursuing this case and observed that a time may come when the steps the court could take in this matter would be exhausted.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">The OS, as previously observed, had at first, supported the applicant&#8217;s attempts to implement the order made by Mr Justice Mostyn on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2017 for the return of RM. The OS as RM&#8217;s representative has, throughout these proceedings, made concerted efforts to ascertain RM&#8217;s location in the first instance, and thereafter obtain information about his well-being, and has, as a result, been able to provide the court with much more, albeit piecemeal, information about RM&#8217;s current living arrangements than that which was before it when the OS first became involved in December 2017. In the interim, of course, RM has reached the age of majority and the orders made in wardship no longer subsist or can be considered capable of enforcement. When Mr Justice Mostyn gave judgment in August 2017 he observed as much, but also referred to the fact that RM would still be subject to </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court as a vulnerable adult. It must be noted that at that time the judge was unaware of RM&#8217;s whereabouts or of his welfare, there only having been the relatively cursory &#8220;safe and well&#8221; check by the police in Florida; nor had His Lordship had the advantage of reading Her Honour Judge Mayer&#8217;s judgments from the protracted Family Court proceedings.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">From the time MM first engaged with these proceedings, it was clear that he had no intention of bringing RM back to the UK. This was not unreasonable, for notwithstanding the circumstances and legality of RM&#8217;s relocation to the USA in November 2016, as observed by Zimran Samuel, RM&#8217;s counsel through the OS, if RM were to be brought back here, the provision of his care and the nature of that care, even where he would live immediately on his return, is far from clear and remained an separate question for the court. It must be made plain that the court would not and could not countenance placing RM in his mother&#8217;s care, given the history of the case, as set out in Her Honour Judge Mayer&#8217;s judgments.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0in">The London Borough of Enfield, the local authority which had been involved in the previous proceedings, although no longer a party, had indicated that they would give assistance to the court in providing information as to the kind of care package that would be available to RM if he were to be returned to the UK; but the assistance the local authority could render the court would only be limited as it could not be expected, nor would it be able, to provide specific information about the appropriate care and placement for RM in the absence of a care assessment which would require assessment of RM himself. Thus, far less is known about what would happen to RM if he were forced to return to this jurisdiction than is known about his current living conditions and social work support in Texas. Moreover, there is nothing before the court to suggest that the courts in the USA would force the return of a vulnerable young man, who is a citizen of their country in these circumstances; such information as the court does have from the attorney in Texas representing MM there suggests it is unlikely. It is unsurprising that the position of the OS from the outset of this hearing was that the USA is now the more convenient forum.  </p>

It was probable that he would be on his own even if accompanied by his father to England and placed with strangers, as the local authority would have no obligation to house MM. Yet this is what his mother asks the court to do to RM. Indeed, when pressed by the court, her counsel accepted that FT would not be satisfied even if it was confirmed by care professionals in the UK that RM was well and properly looked after in the USA, and that she would continue to pursue her application in the Court of Protection. Thus, it would seem that RM, whose own representatives are satisfied that he is being properly and adequately looked after in the USA, is to be returned to the UK largely for the purposes of further litigation at the behest of his mother.  The findings of Her Honour Judge Mayer in her three judgments on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2006, 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2008 and in March 2015 that FT is obsessed by, and thrives on, court hearings is borne out by this stance, which is driven by her quixotic desire to have RM removed from MM to live with her. </p>

It was submitted by the OS on RM&#8217;s behalf that that the determination of an incapacitated adult&#8217;s habitual residence is to be assessed by reference to all the circumstances as they are at the time of assessment; that is to say when the matter is before the court. The Court was taken to the case <span style="font-style:italic">JO v GO &amp; Ors</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2013/3932" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCOP 3932" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCOP 3932</ref>.  On FT&#8217;s behalf it was argued that the case did not extend to cases brought under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court and was limited to Court of Protection (COP) cases; the propriety of this stance is somewhat undermined by FT&#8217;s application to proceed with Court of Protection Proceedings should RM be returned. As submitted by Mr Samuel, a straight reading of the words of Sir James Munby at [21] does not suggest that his decision is limited to COP cases; there is no ambiguity in his words: but even if there were ultimately it is COP proceedings that the court would be considering. The words are quoted below. </p>

Counsel are agreed in submitting, and in my judgment the submission is correct, that determination of an incapacitated adult&#8217;s habitual residence is to be assessed by reference to all the circumstances as they are at the time of assessment. In other words, the principle of perpetuatio fori has no application in this context. Accordingly, the relevant date for determining PO&#8217;s habitual residence is the date of the hearing, July 2013, and not the date when JO made her application, November 2012.&#8221; </span></p>

This court can see no reason in law to depart from this approach in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction pursuant to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref> and the principles of European Law which govern the court&#8217;s jurisdiction.   </p>

I have already noted in the course of this judgment that any further evidence which the court was able to obtain, would not satisfy the applicant as her goal is forcing the return of RM to this jurisdiction, regardless of his best interests, to pursue a case in the Court of Protection. </p>

It is suggested that FT is able to engage with the Texan proceedings to a greater extent than she will admit; I am unable to properly evaluate that submission on the evidence before me, as I did not hear evidence from FT but observe that she has been able to continue pursuing her case, with the benefit of public funding, in this jurisdiction and has shown no disinclination to stop; hence the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s91 (14)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> order made in the Family Court.
