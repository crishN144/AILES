	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">This judgment follows the substantive hearing of the applicant father&#8217;s challenge to the arbitral award made by a jointly appointed arbitrator (&#8220;the arbitrator&#8221;) on 12 August 2022 (&#8220;the award&#8221;).  The award was made pursuant to Schedule 1 (&#8220;Schedule 1&#8221;) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>&#8221;).  The challenge is on two general bases, firstly (Ground 1), that the arbitrator had no power to require the applicant to borrow monies for the purposes of making a settlement of property under paragraph 1(2)(d) of Schedule 1; and, secondly (Grounds 2 &#8211; 12), that the award more generally, was wrong and/or unfair in that it failed to take into account the applicant&#8217;s own needs and his ability to pay. Further, the applicant says that there has been such a significant change of circumstances that it would now be wrong to make the award an order of the court.  The change of circumstances comprises of a continued fall in the applicant&#8217;s net income and a significant increase in interest rates which were unforeseen at the date of the award.  Both matters are attributable to the economic events of September and October 2022.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">Essentially, the award requires the applicant, together with the respondent, to purchase a three-bedroom home for the respondent and the children during the latter&#8217;s minority with a housing fund of &#163;1,100,000 or &#163;1,130,000, depending on whether additional stamp duty land tax (&#8220;SDLT&#8221;) is payable at 3%.  This requires the applicant to enter into a joint mortgage with the respondent in the sum of c.&#163;870,500. The applicant would contribute &#163;240,000 in cash towards the deposit and the costs of purchase.  The Respondent would contribute between &#163;3,000 and &#163;20,000 to the purchase. The applicant will be solely responsible for paying the mortgage instalments.  The property would revert to the parties in proportion to their contributions upon a triggering event.  In addition, the applicant was directed to pay the children&#8217;s school fees, any service charges on the acquired property and &#163;10,000 per annum per child in general maintenance, inclusive of any sums assessed by the CMS.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">I say at the outset that the applicant&#8217;s position in the arbitration was that he would enter into a mortgage to purchase a bigger home for the respondent and the children albeit at a lower borrowing level than that determined by the arbitrator.  Given the applicant&#8217;s position it is hardly surprising that the arbitrator felt able to make the award he did.  As far as I can tell, it was never suggested to him that he, or the court, had no power to make an award requiring the applicant to borrow money for the purposes of housing the children.  There is no reference to this in the award and, I have no doubt, there would have been had the issue been raised.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">The applicant states that neither the arbitrator nor the court has power to require a parent to settle property under paragraph (2)(d) of Schedule 1 unless the relevant parent is entitled to that property either in possession or in reversion.  This means that an order cannot be made requiring a parent to borrow money by way of mortgage or otherwise in order to settle it for the benefit of the child.  The applicant also challenges the award on the basis that there has been such a significant change in the applicant&#8217;s circumstances since the arbitration hearing that it would be unfair to make the award an order of the court.  The relevant change in circumstances is the loss of investment monies in the hedge fund for which the applicant works resulting in his annual income being reduced to between &#163;65,000 and &#163;86,000 odd net.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">The respondent&#8217;s position initially, appeared to be that the court does have power to order the applicant to borrow monies for the purpose of a settlement although, for practical purposes, the order would be framed in two stages, providing the lump sum and then creating the settlement (see the draft order proposed to implement the award which it was said, was mere drafting and not a matter of substance). During the hearing Ms Singer posited that the court can order the applicant to pay a lump sum pursuant to paragraph 1(2)(c) of Schedule 1 for the purpose of providing housing, which monies would subsequently be settled and revert to the applicant upon a triggering event and this would not infringe any prohibition against settlements of property not already in the settlor&#8217;s possession in paragraph 1((2)(d) of Schedule 1 to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, at least, that was my understanding of her oral submissions.  I apologise if I misunderstood.  In any event, the net effect of the submission was that the court could order a lump sum for housing There is no statutory restriction on a lump sum payment limiting it to property in possession or reversion therefore the court could direct the applicant to borrow monies for the purpose. The further written submissions, as I understand them, state that the court can order the payment of a lump sum for the purpose of property provision and, having done so, can then direct the settlement of that sum.  This, it is submitted, is different to ordering the settlement of property.  Further, it is not necessary for the property that is to be the subject of the settlement to have been identified in advance. The applicant&#8217;s objections, it is said, are mere pedantic quibbling about the drafting of the order and the court always retains jurisdiction to give effect to its orders even if this means altering the mechanism originally envisaged or directed.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">As far as the second ground of objection is concerned, the respondent says that the arbitrator took into account potential variations in the applicant&#8217;s income and determined that he would be able to meet any shortfall in times of lower income.  This was open to him on the evidence.  As to the alleged change in circumstances, the court should reject the applicant&#8217;s evidence as to his means on the basis that he has omitted key information, fails to clarify his tax position, does not adequately address his debt position, his non-disclosure in the arbitration proceedings and his lack of full and frank disclosure of his disposition of &#8216;locked&#8217; illiquid shares and his withdrawal of equity from the home occupied by the respondent.  </span></p>

The parties initially had a relationship for 3 &#8211; 5 years leading up to 2012.  They met again in 2015 and rekindled their relationship.  Their eldest child was born on 23 June 2016 and the younger on 23 November 2018.  The parties separated in 2019. Both children are being privately educated. The respondent occupies a two-bedroom flat owned by the applicant.  It is subject to a significant mortgage.  The applicant lives in a 4-bedroom house near the respondent&#8217;s home.  This, also, is subject to a significant mortgage. The housing arrangements had been the subject of agreement, not a court order, as had the payment of school fees and child maintenance by the applicant.  The applicant works for a hedge fund while the respondent is CEO of a tennis charity; she is a former professional tennis player.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">The first set of litigation involved private law proceedings in which the respondent sought permission to relocate to Kent and consequent child arrangements orders. Following reports from a Dr A and an independent social worker, the respondent later withdrew her relocation application and, at a final hearing of the remaining child arrangements issues on 17 January 2022, HHJ Roberts made an order that the children spend equal time with each parent and made, for the family courts, swingeing costs orders against the respondent. While the s.8 proceedings were ongoing, the respondent commenced her Schedule 1 application seeking lump sums, a settlement or transfer of property and periodical payments. There is a CMS calculation in place, which the applicant challenged although it appears that his payments have been assessed at &#163;0, perhaps on the basis of shared care. </span></p>

The applicant issued his challenge to the award on 2 September 2022 and the respondent applied for an order upholding it on 15 September 2022.  Following the respondent lodging a &#8216;triage&#8217; skeleton argument, on 27 October 2022, His Honour Judge Hess granted the applicant permission to pursue his challenge.  The matter was listed for directions before me on 29 November 2022.  One of the matters before me was the applicant&#8217;s application to adduce evidence of a significant change of circumstances which rendered upholding the award wrong.  As the hearing was listed for only 1 hour, I had to reserve judgment on the issue of fresh evidence. I handed down judgment on 28 December 2022 granting permission for the fresh evidence. As has become depressingly regular in the family courts, the parties were unable to agree the terms of an order and there had to be another hearing to settle its terms.  That took place on 11 March 2023. The substantive hearing took place on 22 and 23 June 2023.  </span></p>

Further, while the court has power to order multiple lump sums, it cannot use that power in order to circumvent the prohibition on more than one settlement of property.  Ms Singer required time to consider this authority and formulate her response therefore I reserved judgment.  Her response, written together with Mr Amos, was lodged on 28 June 2023.  As I have found myself writing with increasing frequency, there has been a delay in producing this judgment due to commitments in another court and the inability in this court to provide me with judgment writing time in light of the case load and the absence of judges during August.  I apologise to the parties for the delay.</span></p>

The applicant must persuade me that it is. A decision that is &#8216;wrong&#8217; may be based on an error of law or its impact may be unfair on one or other of the parties. Although I accept, for these purposes, that the children&#8217;s welfare is a weighty factor, as Ms Singer and Mr Amos submit, that does not, it seems to me, lead to a result that the court must, or should, make orders that would leave one parent unable to meet their own needs or the needs of the children while in their care. I must, after all, take into account both parents&#8217; needs as well as their resources (Schedule 1, para 4(1)(a) &amp; (b)). Further, a significant change of circumstances following the award may render it unjust or unfair to make the arbitral award an order of the court in that it may impact on the children&#8217;s welfare by impacting disproportionately on one or other of the parents.  This is the sense in which I use the word &#8216;unfair&#8217; not in the sense that the ultimate test is fairness as between the parents.  Indeed, even in matrimonial finance cases, the welfare of minor children is the court&#8217;s first concern and that can affect the fairness of the outcome as between the adults. </span></p>

The father in that case was wealthy and could meet any sum he was ordered to provide; no borrowing of any sort was necessary.  I cannot see how that helps the respondent here.  In my judgment, an order requiring a parent to borrow money for the purposes of a settlement (or transfer) cannot be made as a settlement (or transfer) may only be ordered of property &#8220;to which either parent is entitled in possession or in reversion&#8221; (paragraph 1(4)(i)).  Making a settlement is either constituting oneself as a trustee of existing property or giving existing property to trustees to hold for particular purposes. Without specified property, there is no settlement.  What </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">Phillips v Peace </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">does hold is that a court cannot use the lump sum provisions to circumvent provisions relating to the exercise of the discretion in relation to settlements.  That is exactly what the respondent is seeking to do albeit that the provision she is seeking to circumvent is that restricting settlements to property to which the relevant parent is entitled rather than that prohibiting a second property adjustment order.</span></p>

It seems to be said that, absent an existing property, the court starts with an order for the provision of a lump sum and then orders the settlement of the property eventually purchased with that lump sum albeit that those steps are often rolled up. That cannot be right as a matter of construction. If the respondent is saying that the settlement does not arise until a particular property is acquired, as opposed to a settlement of the money for such a property, then I disagree. If the paying parent provides the recipient with a lump sum within the meaning of sub-paragraph 1(2)(c), the applicant is not required to use it for a settlement or other particular purpose but only for the benefit of the child or, if not used, retained for or by the child (see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">Phillips v Peace </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">at [27]).  If a lump sum is provided to a receiving parent who may use it </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">only</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt"> to fund the purchase of a property held under a settlement, the receiving parent would hold the money on trust for that purpose: by definition, there would be a settlement of those monies.  The order would have directed a settlement of the monies for a particular purpose not specific real property.  Indeed, that is what Baron J said in terms in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">MB v KB </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">when she said in the passage cited by the respondent, &#8220;The father, who was wealthy, was ordered to settle </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">monies</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt"> on trust to purchase a home for the child which ultimately reverted to him.&#8221; (my emphasis). </span></p>

Further, the requirement that a settlement may be made only out of property to which the relevant parent is entitled would be meaningless as a parent could always be directed to borrow money and then directed to settle such property having become entitled to it.  On a practical note, it is difficult to see how a parent who did not have the necessary funds could borrow sufficient to acquire a home for the child&#8217;s benefit without giving some sort of security to the lender over the relevant property.  In such a case the settlement could not be of the entire value of the property, only of the equity held by the relevant parent. </span></p>

If the paying parent has the means, the court simply sets the sum that is to be subject to the settlement &#8211; it is for the parent to decide how they wish to assemble the monies. They may sell a property, they may raise monies through a mortgage on an existing property, they may sell shares or other investments. Once the monies are settled, it is for the trustees to make decisions about which property will be purchased.  Indeed, it seems to me that that was Peter Jackson J&#8217;s approach in the various </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">G v A</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt"> cases. The settlement had been ordered: the difficulties arose in executing the settlement (purchasing a property) due to unmeritorious objections and unreasonable obstacles raised by the father and his nominated trustee to properties identified by the mother.  Peter Jackson J, whose understandable frustration became more and more evident as the number of applications increased, was merely enforcing the court&#8217;s direction of a settlement and/or exercising the High Court&#8217;s jurisdiction to control and direct trustees. His references to &#8220;inexhaustible pedantic ingenuity&#8221; and &#8220;excessive lack of common sense&#8221; related to the execution of the settlement not its establishment or creation.</span></p>

In that case the settlement was created in 2007 pursuant to an order of Charles J. The dispute before Cohen J was about the substitution of one trust property for another. It seems that the father in that case was also the trustee of the original home. Cohen J was doing no more than giving a trustee directions as to the execution of the trust. Trustees have a duty to exercise their powers to give effect to the trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries. Cohen J was not altering the value of the fund or directing the father to borrow monies.  He permitted the father to buy out the trust&#8217;s interest in the home and the funds generated thereby would be used to purchase a more suitable property. Nothing left or was added to the settlement. If the father wished to buy the trust property, it was a matter for him how he raised the money and, if he chose to borrow it, so be it.  The court was not compelling the trustee or the father to borrow monies. It did not need to do so as the trustee of the settlement already had the power to sell the trust property and use the funds to purchase a new property (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/47" uk:canonical="1996 c. 47" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/47/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6</ref>), the trustee just refused to exercise it. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">If the original property sold for less than &#163;1.35 million that was a loss to the trust caused by the father/trustee&#8217;s default in not maintaining the property and he had to make good the loss to the trust or settlement.  While Cohen J did not express his decision in those precise terms, it seems to me that is the effect of what he said in paragraphs [24] and [26] of his judgment.  This is usual where a trust suffers a loss as a result of a trustee&#8217;s neglect or breach of his duties. Cohen J made it clear that the costs of sale and purchase, including SDLT, had to come out of the &#163;1.35 million of the existing trust property. As to the additional &#163;50,000 ordered by Cohen J, that was clearly a permissible exercise of the power to award multiple lump sums under sub-paragraph 1(2)(c) of Schedule 1.  The money was not subject to a settlement in that it was to be used for the benefit of the children and did not revert to the father upon termination of the settlement. If &#163;25,000 was spent on works to the new property the father would or might, depending on the nature of the works, eventually, receive the benefit of that but, if the works were not carried out, the money would pass to the children per </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">Phillips v Peace</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">.</span></p>

While Hayden J stated that the court retained the jurisdiction to &#8216;vary&#8217; the housing provision [19], it seems to me that he meant only that the court retained jurisdiction to give directions to the trustees in relation to the settlement in the future, specifically in relation to the acquisition of appropriate housing. He is unlikely to have meant that the court could vary the settlement pursuant to its powers under Schedule 1 because sub-paragraph 1(4) only permits the variation of periodical payments (see also paragraphs 6, 6A and 7).  Of course, trusts may be varied by the High Court, as opposed to the Family Court, pursuant to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/6-7/53" uk:canonical="1958 (6 &amp; 7 Eliz. 2) c. 53" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Variation of Trusts Act 1958</ref> and it may be that is what he had in mind.

While this approach is different to that in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">MT v OT</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">, it is not inconsistent with it.  The costs of sale and purchase of future properties are not monies that will be returned to the paying parent at any time; in that sense, they are more akin to a lump sum than a settlement.  Whether such sums should be paid out of a settlement or by way of a lump sum is a matter of discretion for the judge who will consider the fairness of a particular order in light of the circumstances of the particular case. Hayden J plainly was of the view that the scale of the father&#8217;s wealth meant that fairness required costs to be paid by way of lump sum so the value of the child&#8217;s housing was not diminished just because needs dictated a move.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">In none of the above cases was it suggested or implied that a court can order a parent to borrow monies for the purpose of a settlement in circumstances where that parent is not already entitled to property in the required sum.  It is difficult to see how that could be fair even if the court did have such jurisdiction.  Having considered the case law cited to me, I am satisfied that the court does not have power to order a parent to borrow monies or provide property they do not have for the purposes of a settlement.  The court does not adopt a two-stage approach to a settlement by directing the provision of a lump sum for the purposes of purchasing a property which is then settled on the child, it orders the settlement of a sum of money for the purposes of acquiring a suitable property unless there is already a suitable property in the paying parent&#8217;s hands in which case it might direct a settlement of that specific property.  It would be a misuse of the court&#8217;s powers, to borrow Singer J&#8217;s phrase, for the court to utilise the power to award a lump sum to circumvent the restriction on a settlement to property to which the paying parent is already entitled.  That plainly means property to which they are entitled at the time the order is made and not to property to which they might become entitled in the future as a result of a loan agreement.  Further, it does not seem right to order a parent to borrow money when whether or not anyone will lend money is not in that parent&#8217;s control.  An unidentified mortgagee cannot, in my view, be compared to a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">Thomas </span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">resource such as an existing trust fund or generous family member.</span></p>

They do not include other outgoings such as council tax and utilities, food and clothing for the applicant and the children while in his care or any other usual expenditure.  On the basis of the sums the arbitrator attributed to meet the respondent&#8217;s needs (net income of &#163;33,000 and &#163;20,000 of child maintenance) the applicant would have further expenditure of &#163;53,000 a year taking his total expenditure to &#163;200,712 per annum.  While that significantly exceeded the anticipated net income for 2022/2023 of &#163;89,000, the arbitrator was of the view that the applicant could weather this by relying on the resources identified at paragraph 71 of the award being, I infer, a potential SDLT rebate of &#163;34,000, a further &#163;60,000 of mortgage borrowing on his own home and a &#163;60,000 loan from his brother: &#163;154,000 in total.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">In arriving at these figures, the arbitrator adopted a 2.5% mortgage interest rate when the jointly instructed mortgage broker had indicated a figure of 3% interest.  The higher figure would increase repayments by &#163;6,000 per annum. He declined to take into account an increase of &#163;13,000 per annum in mortgage payments on the Applicant&#8217;s home from July 2023 upon the expiry of the fixed term, on the basis that he did not know what the rates might be then.  The arbitrator declined to adjust the credit card repayments by an additional &#163;6,000 per annum to reflect the end of the 0% interest in October 2023, for the same reason. He also declined to include the expected increase in school fees of &#163;12,500 per annum from September 2023.  If all this increased expenditure occurred, the applicant&#8217;s outgoings would be &#163;37,500 higher at &#163;238,212 which exceeds his earning capacity of &#163;223,000.  It would exceed his 2022/2023 net income by at least &#163;123,712 (excluding the increases taking effect in or after July 2023).  Further, the applicant needs to find between &#163;11,705 and &#163;38,705 to make up the housing fund for the proposed new property for the respondent.  If the required figure is the higher one, the sums required in 2022/2023 over and above his net income exceed the additional resources identified and quantified by the arbitrator. To the extent that the applicant may have a further indirect income resource from his mother&#8217;s company, the arbitrator did not quantify the level of income and it is not possible for me to do so on a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">quasi</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt">-appeal. However, it does not seem to me, on the basis of what the arbitrator said in this respect, that it is likely to plug the gap between the applicant&#8217;s financial obligations and needs and his income/resources.</span></p>

It exceeds his income and resources, including additional borrowing, in 2022/2023.  It makes no provision for the payment of &#163;248,000 odd plus interest in existing tax liabilities, even under a repayment plan; it makes no provision for the repayment of legal fees; it makes no provision for payment of the 2022/2023 tax liabilities which the arbitrator found would be paid out of the 2023/2024 net income; it makes no provision for repayment of the additional borrowings needed in order to generate the funds required to meet the shortfall in 2022/2023. Even if one deducts the private school fees of &#163;32,000, as appears to be the position in the parties&#8217; open offers for this hearing, the arbitral award is too high in the light of the applicant&#8217;s hard liabilities.</span></p>

Mortgage rates are double or almost double the 2.5% rate taken by the arbitrator which would increase the applicant&#8217;s outgoings on mortgage instalments alone by c.&#163;52,000 a year.  The evidence shows that the hedge fund&#8217;s fortunes have continued to decline with the result that the applicant&#8217;s net income in 2022/2023 was expected to be c.&#163;64,000. The applicant&#8217;s hedge fund is not alone in this respect.  Even if the applicant received a further payment of &#163;57,817 gross in January 2023, that would still produce a net income of little more than &#163;86,000 net. While the applicant can, and will have to, find employment that will pay him more, it is not clear how feasible that is in the current economic climate or what income he is likely to achieve.  In any event, even if he reaches the earning capacity determined by the arbitrator, the award is unaffordable for him.</span></p>

The capital resources, on the findings of the arbitrator are only &#163;272,000 at the highest which includes the equity in both homes and that in the respondent&#8217;s property. I cannot properly order the applicant to make payments for which he does not have the funds or other resources. Given that the parties have spent c. four times their current joint assets on litigation and come close to rendering themselves and their children homeless, I can only urge them to be realistic and take steps to ensure that their children&#8217;s needs are met as best they may be in the current circumstances.</span></p>
