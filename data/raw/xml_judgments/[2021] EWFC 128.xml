Her application notice identified three claims: (i) compensation in relation to the sale of properties in the ownership of the children of the family; (ii) the repayment of gift monies and income distributions from the Settlement; and (iii) a more vague reference to concern that the children of the family would &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">never receive our inheritance as beneficiaries of the [RWS Settlement]</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217;. On 21 September 2021, L withdrew the application. It was unlikely to have been successful, had it been pursued, given the lateness with which the application was made (notwithstanding the orders made by His Honour Judge O&#8217;Dwyer at the FDR) and the likely costs implications of the adjournment to which such joinder would inevitably have led.</span></p>

Almost three years later, &#163;1,947,314 of the asset &#8216;pot&#8217; which would otherwise have been available for distribution between the parties following this long marriage, has gone. This is entirely due to legal fees. The Trustees&#8217; costs, not included above, are &#163;605,402 of which &#163;253,931 remains outstanding.

This was thus a long marriage. W&#8217;s Petition was lodged on 21 November 2018 and Decree Nisi was pronounced on 23 May 2019. The Decree has not yet been made absolute, but this is not of itself controversial and merely awaits the outcome of these proceedings. I have given W permission to apply for Decree Absolute (more than 12 months having elapsed), although it is agreed that no application will be made until the financial remedy order consequent upon this judgment has been sealed.</span></p>

WS (</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">PWS) </span><span style="font-size:12pt">who is H&#8217;s younger brother and one of the Trustees. My preliminary observations as to the parties as witnesses is as follows: As to W, I am afraid I was unable to accept all of her evidence as truthful or accurate. I gained the clear impression that she had limited knowledge of the family&#8217;s financial circumstances and it is this which, in part, explains her present perception that H has assets and resources that he has failed to disclose. To give but one example, W was adamant that H had received &#163;1.75m in about 2007, either from the Trust or another undisclosed source. H&#8217;s team were able swiftly to establish that this was in fact the advance of funds from the mortgage secured against the former family home. W&#8217;s emotional attachment to this property was palpable and I fear that her approach to these proceedings has been coloured by her burning desire to retain it, despite her case that it suffers from severe damp, a redundant electrical system, obsolete plumbing and a kitchen in disrepair with broken appliances. As to H, his evidence was often very vague and unsatisfactory. He struggled with recall. There were aspects of his historical financial dealings which were opaque at best and which I well understand will have made W suspicious of his disclosure. On the whole, however, I found him to be doing his best to assist the court. PWS (a solicitor) was an impressive witness, whose evidence reflected the Trustees&#8217; general approach of seeking to assist the court. He provided much (but not all) of the detail that H was unable to provide.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.1in"><span style="font-size:12pt">W is convinced that H has assets which he has failed to disclose within the proceedings. There can be no doubt that the parties enjoyed a lavish standard of living for much of their marriage. Indeed, the picture which emerges clearly from the evidence, and particularly that of PWS, is that their spending was extravagant and unwise, even in the context of their wealth. I heard evidence, for example, of H and W having spent &#163;273,898 in one New York jewellery shop in a day (August 2007) and &#163;390,000 being spent on a Bar Mitzvah. I note the value of the various jewellery and pen collections that the parties have accumulated over the years. I accept that PWS was shocked when he learned, during the proceedings, of the extent of H and W&#8217;s spending. It is agreed that from 2009, RWS and PWS effectively managed and controlled the family&#8217;s expenditure due to concerns as to H and W&#8217;s financial mismanagement. RWS set up an HSBC account, designated the Y No 2 account, of which PWS and RWS were signatories (notably not H or W). H&#8217;s income, distributions and loans (when made) were paid into the account, the day to day running of which was managed by an accountant. The mortgage, bills and insurances on the family home and school fees were settled directly from this account and two monthly payments of &#163;3,000 and &#163;2,000 were made to the joint account and to W&#8217;s account respectively. In 2012, when H&#8217;s employment with ABC came to an end, so too did the healthy distributions which he had been receiving for his work in ABCM. The parties&#8217; spending does not appear to have slowed down to reflect this change. H first asked his father for a loan (of which more later) in c. July 2014, by which stage the &#8216;severance&#8217; payment of &#163;879,215 which had been made to H in March 2013 had already been spent. On 13 October 2014, H entered into a Loan Agreement with J Ltd which recorded a loan facility of &#163;240,000, to be applied in part to redeem the sum of &#163;100,000 borrowed between 31 July and 3 October 2014, but with a rather curious &#8216;bolt on&#8217; agreement that on sale of the family home, &#163;5m of the proceeds of sale would be invested on behalf of H and held in trust. This did not in fact happen. That all of this was considered necessary by RWS (and PWS) speaks volumes.</span></p>

In 2006, RWS gifted &#163;3m to each of H and his brothers (offshore). In or about 2007, H purchased a property in Israel for $2.7m. H could not even remember whether the property was held in his name or through a company structure (D Ltd). The property was sold in 2010. It is not clear what happened to the net proceeds of sale, and this has never been fully explored. The likelihood is that the parties have simply spent the proceeds. In the same year, H purchased a property in Mexico. Again, his recollection of the detail is &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">hazy</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217;, but he believes that this too was held by D Ltd on his behalf. This property was sold in 2012 for $5.1m and some of the proceeds, $3.02m, were invested in the Washington property. Again, it is not clear what happened to the surplus, but H says that the parties &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">went through the profit&#8230; in no time</span><span style="font-size:12pt">&#8217;. Certainly, as I have already indicated, the parties did not hesitate to spend freely and excessively during the marriage. Some of the funds are likely to have been spent to fund L&#8217;s education abroad and on rental accommodation there for her and H, with journeys made by cruise ship to and from there. In 2013, &#163;350,000 was invested into a Green Card Scheme.</span></p>

She and W rely on a document said to have been provided by H to W, setting out a record of his finances should anything happen to him. The document, which appears in the bundle, includes the following &#8216;Israel flat is in a trust for the childred (sic) and therefore in there (sic) ownership. You have the right to reinvest the money into another property&#8217;. H denied that he had written the relevant parts of the document and asserted that it had been forged. He went on to accept, however, that discussions had indeed taken place with his father at the relevant time about the possibility of the Israel property being purchased on trust for the children, that a Deed to that end had been created by lawyers in Switzerland but that it not been executed in Israel because it would not have been legally recognised there. Subsequently I was provided with an unsigned and undated document entitled &#8216;A Notice about a Trust&#8217; which in fact suggested that the property was held by C I S.A. (a subsidiary of D Ltd) on trust for H. The evidence surrounding this was all very unsatisfactory.</span></p>

When she wrote to the court in the early hours of the morning on 21 September 2021 stating that she wished to withdraw her application, it was clear that she had misunderstood the position as to the court&#8217;s approach to the Israel and Mexico properties. I informed her that contrary to her understanding, I did not propose to make findings in respect of her asserted claims unless and until she was joined as a party to the proceedings and had filed pleadings. L confirmed that she still wished to withdraw and that she would take proceedings elsewhere. It is tolerably clear that if she does issue separate proceedings these will be against her father alone. Mr Thorpe and Ms Faggionato invite me to determine that any future judgment entered against H in favour of the children of the family in respect of the proceeds of sale of these properties should essentially be satisfied by both H and W in equal measure. It seems to me that can be achieved by way of an indemnity. It cannot be right that L be permitted to bring proceedings against her father alone in relation to assets which form part of a whole matrimonial &#8216;pot&#8217; and in circumstances where she has had every opportunity since December 2018. Beyond that, I do not propose to comment further in respect of L&#8217;s complaints against the Trustees or H.</span></p>

I have already referred to the fact that W&#8217;s present solicitors are the eighth firm that she has instructed during the lifetime of the proceedings. Aside W&#8217;s case that the Settlement is a nuptial settlement capable of variation, W&#8217;s case was also run on what I consider a wholly unsustainable argument that she was somehow entitled to a share of the Settlement assets, none of which are vested in H, because of H&#8217;s now historical role within the Settlement&#8217;s underlying company asset(s). On day two, (on instruction) Mr Becker made the realistic and appropriate concession that this argument could not be advanced, although it was still argued that the Settlement is a nuptial settlement.</span></p>

H and PWS were directors of both F Ltd and ABCM. None of their other siblings worked for the management company and RWS decided that H and PWS should benefit from the profits. Between 2007 and 2012, both H and PWS received income distributions from this sub-trust. During that five-year period, H received &#163;2,584,700. In addition, he also received remuneration (including, I think, commission and/or bonus) referable to his employment. For the sake of completeness, ABCM would source the investments and thereafter manage the property and the investment. This would typically consist of (i) property management (rent and service charge collection), (ii) asset management (lettings and development), (iii) strategic management (development strategy and exit strategy and &#8216;client&#8217; oversight for a fee based on rent collected, service charge and a profit share.</span></p>

Because his work for ABCM had ceased, so too did the income distributions from the sub-trust. On 15 March 2013, H resigned as a director of F Ltd. The F Ltd shares were distributed out (equally) to H and PWS (on 13 March 2013), so the sub-trust ceased to exist. On 17 March 2014, H&#8217;s shares in F Ltd were bought back by the company for approximately &#163;100,000. Later, in about 2016, RWS decided to bring ABCM back within the Trust and PWS&#8217;s shares were also bought back.</span></p>

On 14 January 2021, District Judge Duddridge determined that W should not be permitted to pursue allegations of fraud in this regard. H and W agree that the children should be repaid what is outstanding of the gift from RWS but there remains an issue as to who should be responsible for repayment. W argues that H should repay the full amount. H says that it should be met equally. Without descending into the complaint made by the children against H and/or the Trustees, it is nonetheless necessary to consider the state of W&#8217;s knowledge and the approach that she adopted in November 2017.</span></p>

His approach was that any distribution made to a particular branch of the family should be applied towards that branch&#8217;s overall indebtedness, irrespective of which family member within the branch owed the money.

Hence, a settlement made before marriage, but not in relation to or contemplation of the particular marriage, is not within the section, but it is within it, if from its recitals or substance it is apparent that it is related to a particular marriage. Similarly, in the case of a settlement made after marriage. If the marriage is recited or expressly referred to, it is patently a factor; but, if it is not recited or referred to, it may still be a factor; and, since the marriage is an existing fact which the settlor must have had in mind, the absence of recital makes little difference.&#8221;</span></p>

As Mr Richardson submits, the structure of the Settlement, in its very articulation of its beneficial class, is that of a dynastic trust. Importantly, it is focussed on the children of the settlor because they are his children, regardless of their marital status on the date on which the Settlement was created or at any future date. The beneficial class is one of bloodline, with spouses, widows and widowers as adjunct beneficiaries, dependent for their status on their continued marriage to one of the bloodline beneficiaries.

However, when dividends were historically declared this was a) at a time when the company profits permitted such dividends; and b) distributions from the Settlement were for the large part essentially ledger entries because of the outstanding loans to various beneficiaries within the individual family branches.

Superficially the question is easily framed as being whether the trust is a financial &#8216;resource&#8217; of the husband for the purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25(2)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>).

PWS explains, however, that (i) monies have been retained to be applied towards the Settlement&#8217;s IHT charges and other tax liabilities on its income receipts; and (ii) The Trustees have incurred significant legal fees to protect the interests of the beneficiaries (albeit that by my order much of this will be recovered).</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.11in"><span style="font-size:12pt">As to the position of ABCH, the latest accounts with which I have been provided are for the year ended 2019. They reveal net current assets (as opposed to fixed assets) of &#163;1,688,369. The accounts pre-date the Covid-19 pandemic. I accept PWS&#8217;s evidence that ABC does not anticipate having available resources to secure the funding of distributions out of the Settlement for at least a few years. This arises in part because of the pandemic which has adversely impacted property values and the turnover/cashflow of ABC and ABCM and also because of the loss of the D investment management fees on its liquidation. As PWS explained the group is primarily invested in retail, offices and public houses. Across the board, demand has declined and ABC&#8217;s turnover from rental income has decreased. Tenants have taken advantage of the moratorium, others have exercised break clauses and it will be a challenge to acquire new tenants, particularly with the new practice of working from home. Outgoings continue even where office and retail space is vacant. As a result, cash resources at ABC (which might otherwise have been available as dividends) have been used to support ABCM (by way of loan) and ABC may need to utilise some of its available funds to pay down some the some of its secured borrowing (although the group is not particularly debt-burdened). The Trustees&#8217; approach historically has been to preserve capital (not to sell to release funds) and to ensure the financial security of the underlying assets rather than pushing for annual income distributions when not affordable. Now would not be a good time to sell in any event. Finally, whenever dividends are declared to be paid down into the Settlement, the latter will incur a tax liability of 45%.</span></p>

PWS rejected the possibility of an outright capital appointment but had accepted (in his written evidence) that H would be treated in line with the other principal beneficiaries in terms of income distributions as and when the Settlement was able to make such distributions. He did not consider that this would be possible for a few years. Given the history of capital loans being made by the Settlement (in H&#8217;s case alone &#163;1,243,837 over 5 years), this was of particular interest. PWS confirmed that all requests for a loan from the Settlement would be considered individually and that any loan made would attract interest as before. If the borrower had demonstrable security any loan could be repaid from income distributions as has occurred in the past, but repayment would have to be made within sensible time limits. Although PWS initially stated that he could not entirely rule out the possibility of a loan, he made clear that (i) he would not support a loan to purchase property in Israel; (ii) any loan would require the unanimous decision of the Trustees; and (iii) having spoken with a fellow Trustee, the resounding answer to each of the propositions put to him was no. In any event, I accept PWS&#8217;s evidence that the need to accumulate funds will have a direct and important impact on the ability to make loans and that the Settlement is simply not in a position to do so, nor will it be for the foreseeable future.</span></p>

The intention of the settlor (whilst not binding) was always to preserve capital within the Settlement for his bloodline. I found PWS to be a clear, compelling and truthful witness. There was not one aspect of his written or oral evidence that caused me to doubt for one moment the independence and bona fides of the Trustees. I am far from satisfied that the Trustees</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">, </span><span style="font-size:12pt">having been apprised of all relevant facts, would respond positively to a request by H to make funds available to him for his needs for the foreseeable future. Indeed, given the history of the family intervening in H&#8217;s financial affairs, the fact that no outright capital distribution has ever been made save in relation to the sub-trust which had a specific purpose and was related to the historic endeavours of H and PWS and the Trustees&#8217; observance of their fiduciary duties towards all the discretionary beneficiaries, I find it far more likely that the Trustees would not do so. Nor does it appear that the Settlement has, or is likely to have within the foreseeable future, sufficient funds to make a loan to H to meet his housing need. Those are my findings.</span></p>

In that case a husband sought financial provision from a wife. She had limited assets of her own but was within the class of beneficiaries of two discretionary trusts. As Holman J said, the two trusts were the &#8216;focus or target&#8217; of his application (just as W&#8217;s have been here), and he asked Holman J to make orders against the wife, in the expectation that the trusts would provide her with the means of paying them.

But this tragic and destructive case should stand as a cautionary tale to those who would embark on expensive litigation which they can ill afford in the hope of prising money from a discretionary trust. A very careful and cool appraisal needs to be made at the very outset as to how realistic a prospect that really is.&#8221;</span></p>

The marital standard of living cannot always be replicated after divorce. The tragedy of this case is that whilst it was always likely that the parties would have to make some adjustment following separation, the scale of the inevitable adjustment they now face is directly attributable to costs. Mr Thorpe and Ms Faggionato make the compelling point that H will inevitably bear some of the brunt because of the way W, and not he, has chosen to conduct this litigation.</span></p>

Inevitably, given what is left, he no longer suggests that W&#8217;s housing need be met by a fund of c. &#163;1.75m. Whilst I recognise that these properties represent a significant departure from the family home in terms of size and location, the family home is subject to a substantial mortgage and the funds to retain it are simply not available.

A Duxbury fund of c.&#163;736,486 (rounded to &#163;736,500) would provide this but only until W&#8217;s age 70 (in ten years&#8217; time) when it would reduce by one third to &#163;40,000. A fund of c. &#163;934,000 would be required to produce an income of &#163;60,000 for life. I have found this a difficult point. On the one hand, given the length of the marriage, the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage and the likelihood that in about 4 years, H will again receive further income distributions from the Settlement of c.&#163;70,000 to &#163;80,000 per annum, it could be argued that it would not be fair that W&#8217;s income is so constrained from age 70. On the other hand, I remind myself that W&#8217;s costs have increased by c. &#163;319,000 and H&#8217;s by &#163;772,000 since H&#8217;s October 2020 offer and that W alone is responsible for the Trustees&#8217; costs. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">&#163;1,575,111 </span><span style="font-size:12pt">has effectively been wasted in costs since H made an open proposal which was well within the ambit of what the court might at that point have found fair.

Ultimately, I have concluded, in all the circumstances, that W&#8217;s income needs will be adequately met by a fund of &#163;736,486.

This is, of course, less than she is entitled to on a sharing basis (&#163;2,100,984). However, the costs orders which have already been made and which I propose to make in favour of the Trustees (&#163;484,111 in total) are such that, on an equal sharing of the net matrimonial liquid capital, W would recover only c. &#163;1,616,783. This would not meet her needs, the shortfall being c. &#163;168,717, rounded to &#163;169,000. I bear in mind, too, that some of W&#8217;s capital is in the form of jewellery and chattels which she will have to realise in order to meet future income need. It is likely that the sale of chattels will be piecemeal and the value realisable less reliable than bricks and mortar or money in the bank. I consider that W ought to have &#163;20,000 for a motor car and be able to retain some items of sentimental value (a further &#163;20,000). Applying a very broad brush, I therefore consider that W&#8217;s shortfall will be in the region of &#163;209,000.</span></p>

Although I have found that the Trustees would not advance capital to H (whether outright or by way of loan), I do find it likely that H will receive further income distributions in about four years&#8217; time as PWS speculated (on a bestcase scenario) and that these will likely be at the same approximate rate of between &#163;70,000 to &#163;80,000 npa. Whilst H will thus have to fund his income needs from capital once the Washington property is sold, this will be for a limited period, and he is unlikely to have to amortise his capital thereafter to meet his need for income. Moreover, he will retain his shareholdings and will thus be the economically stronger of the two, although I acknowledge that there is no evidence before the court as to any market for his shares at the present time. They may not be matrimonial assets susceptible to sharing, but they are resources. I have given careful thought as to whether there should be some form of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">Wells </span><span style="font-size:12pt">sharing in respect of the shareholdings but have concluded that this would not be principled. Once W&#8217;s needs are met, there are no grounds to share non-matrimonial capital. Litigants are repeatedly warned in reported cases of the need to approach litigation reasonably and realistically and to engage in meaningful negotiation.</span></p>

After the purchase of a property in Israel, he would be left with capital of &#163;892,857 (of which his car/chattels represent &#163;343,220). I am satisfied that this will meet his needs. He will also retain his shareholding which may be the source of liquid wealth in the future, and he will, on the balance of probabilities, benefit from future income distributions from the Settlement. I recognise that W&#8217;s litigation conduct has reduced H&#8217;s assets because of the fees he must now pay to his lawyers, albeit that I consider the costs of &#163;722,000 incurred over an 11- month period to be excessive. H may be left with the impression that he is effectively paying some of the Trustees&#8217; costs by the back door and/or that W has litigated with impunity. That is not my intention.
