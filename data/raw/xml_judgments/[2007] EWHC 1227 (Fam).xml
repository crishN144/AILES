On that occasion the learned District Judge dealt with an&#160;application for a&#160;variation of the wife's periodical payments made by&#160;consent in June 1988.  She also considered whether to capitalise such maintenance as she ordered.  After two days of evidence the District Judge made the following order: </span></p>

The husband was ordered to pay two-thirds of the wife's costs.  The lump sum of &#163;500,000 was in addition to a&#160;payment of &#163;50,000 which had been made on account to the wife at an&#160;earlier stage of the proceedings.  I suspect that capital went towards the arrears under paragraph (i) of the order because the District Judge considered there had been inadequate maintenance paid from the date of the wife&#8217;s application.  </span></p>

The&#160;total of &#163;512,000 was rounded down.  The wife&#8217;s counsel, Mr Sefi, suggested that this calculation was more appropriate than a&#160;strict Duxbury (albeit that, it is fair to note, his primary submission was that the wife should receive a&#160;lump sum based on the cost of the annuity).</span></p>

Equally, a&#160;judge hearing such an&#160;appeal should not admit fresh evidence unless there is a&#160;need to do so on the application of the more liberal rules for the admission of fresh evidence recognised as necessary in Family proceedings." </span></p>

I have seen a&#160;report by an&#160;expert called Dr&#160;B who reported that the wife has connective tissue diseases, including scleroderma, polyomysitis and lupus.  She also has arthritis of her hips and shoulders.  In November 2003 her right hip was replaced.  The operation was only partially successful because she suffered foot problems which affected her mobility.  In addition she had chronic back pain and muscle problems.  The lupus means that she suffers from cold hands with decreased dexterity.  Her prognosis, although, and I quote, she is expected "to have a&#160;slightly reduced life expectancy due to her connective tissue diseases&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;does not enable us to give an&#160;accurate assessment of her prognosis.  Many patients survive into their 80s&#8221;.  In reality, the wife may well require a&#160;number of years of financial help to enable her to live a&#160;comfortable lifestyle, or, at least, to enable her to carry out activities of daily living without too much stress.  Her problems are mainly of mobility but she is described as &#8220;being in very good spirit and not one to be deterred by her disability&#8221;.  Her symptoms are controlled by the use of powerful drugs.  Even so, this wife has to undergo regular visits to hospital.  </span></p>

She retired in about 2000 (when she was 62 years old) with a&#160;retirement package worth &#163;15,000.  Given her disabilities, she is to be commended for her attempts to make herself self-sufficient.  Of course, given her age at the date of divorce (about 50 years old) and her continuing duties to the children (the younger of whom was only 14 years old) she was not in a&#160;position to command a&#160;higher salary.  I doubt that she was able to make any significant savings out of her modest earnings.  At the date of separation the youngest child was still in full-time education and she went on to university.  It is conceded by the husband that the wife continued to make a&#160;contribution to the welfare of the family until the youngest child ceased full-time education, which as far as I can tell was in about 1992.

Thus only an extreme change of circumstances (such as ill health or a&#160;dramatic change in planning regulations) would justify a&#160;disposal of the site.  The husband considered that the offers fell short of providing any financial advantage, therefore there was no point in selling the site in the face of the current available net yield.  In those circumstances the husband decided to extend the leases and refurbish the buildings to a&#160;reasonable standard.  In the event of his inability to work in the future, he determined to place the property management out to professionals.  Of course, this means unlike many people, he is assured of a&#160;long-term income stream even when he is unable to undertake the active day to day management of the site.  </span></p>

This, he asserts, is relevant and important because it is part of the analysis of fairness.  He submits it is not sufficient for the District Judge to have approached this case on a&#160;&#8220;not less than&#8221; value.  The corollary must be that if the additional &#163;1.6 million gross, say &#163;1 million net of CGT, had been added to the pot the District Judge would have found the assets to be worth some &#163;5.5 million (subject to her other alleged errors), consequently her award would have been greater.  I do not accept that submission in the context of the particular facts of this case.  I do not believe that whether this husband is worth &#8220;not less than &#163;4.5 million&#8221;, as found, or is worth &#163;5.5 million or even &#163;6 million, that that, of itself, is determinative of the award.  </span></p>

In reality that meant that there was a&#160;surplus income of &#163;150,000 net per annum after his own needs were covered in full.  That crucial finding was more than sufficient to give scope to satisfy the wife's claims without there being any question of raising any&#160;realistic argument about liquidity.  If the husband did not wish to sell any of the assets, the surplus income was sufficient to cover borrowings, even on the basis of the wife's submissions that she was entitled to a&#160;lump sum in the region of &#163;1.5 million.  Accordingly there was sufficient capacity in this case.  The two valuers have seen the additional evidence and, perhaps unsurprisingly, neither has changed their stance.

In my judgment this approach to s 25(2)(c) accords with the language of the statute and the underlying purpose of s 31.

It is therefore logical that a payee is not precluded from deriving benefit from an&#160;increase in the payor's fortunes even if this results in the payee enjoying a&#160;higher standard of living than he or she did during the marriage."</span></p>

Mr&#160;Sefi seeks to avoid the problem by the cost of purchasing an&#160;annuity, but I do not accept this part of his submission.  The &#8220;industry standard&#8221;, as Miss&#160;Eaton has described the Duxbury calculation, produces (subject to the exclusion of the pension error) the same figure as the Duckworth tables.  I intend to adopt Duxbury as the starting point in this case using it as a&#160;tool to assist with really the fair outcome.  It is not the entire answer, given this lady's age, unless the multiplicand is sufficiently high.  It is, however, a&#160;check against such order as I consider is appropriate.  </span></p>

Subsection (a): the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources of these parties.  The husband's assets are not less than &#163;4.5 million in accordance with the District Judge's findings.  His income, to my mind more important, is a long term &#163;200,000 net spendable per annum.  The wife's total capital is about &#163;488,000 and her income, as already said, is about &#163;3,600 net from her pension and &#163;3,000 net from her disability allowance.  </span></p>

I have no doubt that this husband has sufficient to cover all of his needs in the long and short term.  The wife has a&#160;proper home.  I have seen photographs of the property within which it is built and it is sufficient for her needs.  However she also needs sufficient capital to enable her to live the rest of her life without having to worry about finances.  At her age she should not feel that she is confined to a&#160;budget without there being some margin for error.  Twenty-four years of marriage give her that entitlement.  </span></p>

Of course I take into account fully the fact that a&#160;great deal of his wealth had been accumulated since these parties have separated.  That is a&#160;factor which I bear in the forefront of my mind when considering the fair outcome of this case.  Whilst I have obviously outlined the wife's continuing making a&#160;contribution to the welfare of the family, I have no doubt that through his financial acumen the husband has also made a&#160;continuing contribution to the welfare of his children.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ContinCol" style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.8in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">After this lengthy judgment, therefore, I come to my conclusions.  I consider that the district judge was plainly wrong when she assessed this wife's variation claims at a&#160;level of &#163;40,000 per annum and capitalised it at &#163;500,000.  I consider that the figure was plainly too low in the context of this case, the wife's needs as &#8220;generously interpreted&#8221;.  I take into account her right to have an&#160; element of compensation.  I do not consider it is right to seek to separate those two factors in delineating my figure.  I consider that the right lump sum for the termination of her periodical payments is a&#160;total of &#163;725,000.  On a&#160;Duxbury type of formulation this would provide the wife with somewhat less than &#163;60,000 per annum net, in addition to which she will have &#163;6,600, being her attendance allowance and net pension.  She will then have a&#160;total net spendable income in the region of &#163;65,000, if she decides to spend all her income in that way.  However, if she uses her funds more wisely it would enable her to have sufficient additional capital to deal with unforeseen circumstances (even giving allowance for the small amount of her own capital that I have already outlined).  This will enable her to deal with the additional expenditure which often comes with age and increasing ill health.  The House of Lords made it clear that there is no reason why one party to the marriage should die with no savings.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ContinCol" style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.8in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I consider this to be fair in the outcome of this case.  This wife is entitled to spend her latter years without undue concern so far as finances are concerned.  She will have an&#160;income of about &#163;60,000 under a&#160;Duxbury type of calculation together with her own income and this represents about 30 per cent of the husband's net spendable income.  It is in line with what was originally agreed and is a&#160;fair division, given his additional work since 1985 and the wife's needs and rights to compensation.  In fact, the Duxbury figure for &#163;60,000 is &#163;734,000 but I have rounded it down because I consider that is fair.  That is the figure that this husband will pay to capitalise her claims.  </span></p>
