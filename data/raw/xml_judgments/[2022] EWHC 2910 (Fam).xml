Esmarelda's Father is JJ, the Second Respondent (the Father). He opposed the making of an order setting out his opposition in a statement to the Court. He was given the opportunity and the means to join this hearing by link but availed himself of neither.

Both of Esmarelda's birth parents, (and Esmarelda), are Country F nationals; they married on 11 October 2003, separated in January 2008, and were divorced on 27 May 2008. Esmarelda's contact with her father, following her parents&#8217; separation when she was 4, was, according to the Mother, minimal and sporadic. The Father&#8217;s evidence is that it was more than that and included time spent with his family &#8211; with whom he said she was fully integrated. His evidence is that, of course, he did not see her daily but that there was what he called <span style="font-style:italic">a strong and established relationship between father and daughter.</span></p>

That fact adds an additional layer of complexity to a case which, as the Guardian, the applicant and the Mother acknowledge, is already not straightforward. That this is so has been reflected in the excellent skeleton argument prepared on behalf of the applicant and the mother by Ms Segal. Esmarelda's nationality meant that an issue which fell to be considered is whether there is a requirement to notify the Country F Consulate or, in the event that there is a discretion, whether I should exercise that discretion against notification. </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;since certain designated articles of the Vienna Convention have specifically been given by statue the force of law in the United Kingdom, the remaining articles of the Vienna Convention do not have the force of law in the United Kingdom and remain (as one sometimes finds) Convention articles which are not actually part of United Kingdom law. So, the word &#8220;duty&#8221; in article 37 has to be seen in that light. I have not heard any argument on this, still less argument from both sides. It does seem to me however, at least provisionally, that the court is not obliged in private law proceedings to notify the national consular offices of a child who is a foreign national (although in the circumstances of the particular issues raised in the particular proceedings, it may be desirable or even perhaps necessary to do so). It is a matter of discretion. The majority of private law proceedings involving a child of foreign nationality where a Children&#8217;s Guardian is in place would not require notification of consular authorities, as this would generally be disproportionate and cause unnecessary work and clutter all round: for example, a difficulty inter-family contact or residence dispute over a child who happened to be of foreign nationality, where there happened to be a children&#8217;s guardian appointed. In cases like that, foreign consular staff would have no interest or role. Here however the nationality issue means that it is appropriate for the Indian consular authorities to have been notified of the fact of the proceedings, which indeed they have now been, albeit with very little time to respond&#8217;.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the circumstances which Mrs Justice Lieven came to consider the question of notification there were two reasons why notification might be appropriate. The first of which was to try to trace the Father of the child concerned. The situation here might have been similar had Esmarelda's Father not been contactable and had it been necessary as had seemed might be so (when appointing a guardian for her) in the earlier part of this year to seek assistance in establishing his whereabouts and a line of communication with him. It is however quite different since communication has been established with Esmarelda's father and he has engaged with this application &#8211; and set out his opposition.    The second reason for notification in the case before Lieven J (which I remind myself was in the context of an adoption of a relinquished baby arising from public law care proceedings) was to invite any view on placement and whether proceedings should be transferred to the relevant country (Romania). Whilst those are not circumstances which arise here I hold in my mind the observations made by Lieven J that <span style="font-style:italic">It must be remembered that AK is a Romanian citizen and is not a British citizen. Although there is no duty under the Vienna Convention to notify, for the reasons set out above, that does not mean that the Court can simply ignore the fact that it would be making an order about a foreign national without the relevant authorities of that state being informed. As Baker J made clear in&#160;</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re JL</span><span style="font-style:italic">&#160;there remains a discretion to notify where the Vienna Convention does not require it.</span></p>

In effect, here the citizen of one country is going through a process by which he will become a citizen of another country, in circumstances where he is too young to express a view, and the first country is not being informed. However, I accept that this is an unusual case. AK is unable to express any view on the situation. For the reasons I have set out above, I consider it to be both in his best interests and those of the Mother, that the Romanian authorities are not notified because of the risk to the Mother, the lack of benefit to AK from doing so and the inevitable and possibly prolonged delay. For those reasons, I will exercise my discretion not to notify the Romanian consular authorities.</span></p>

Against that background Ms Segal&#8217;s submission that the appointment of a children&#8217;s guardian in proceedings concerning a foreign national subject child does not automatically trigger the operation of article 37(b) and that it follows that in the circumstances of this case, and these proceedings, there is no duty to notify the Country F Consulate. I accept the submission made. Mr Niven-Phillips on behalf of the Guardian and Esmarelda made no separate submission on this point (though neither did he offer any contrary submission to that of Ms Segal).

Quite the reverse.

The fact that he has not elected to participate in person or to make use of the facility offered to join the hearing remotely does not alter any of that. I have held in my mind throughout this hearing the way in which he has in the statement he prepared expressed his opposition.  I heard, therefore, oral evidence from the Applicant, the Mother, the social worker who prepared the Annex A report and from the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  Whilst it is unnecessary to set out here the detail of all I have heard and read I have read carefully and had regard to all of that which has been placed before me. </p>

He gave his evidence with Esmarelda sitting only metres away from him in the well of the court and there was a near tangible connection between them. It was as illuminating to see Esmarelda watching him as he gave his evidence as it was to see him looking over at her as he spoke.  In particular, I was convinced that he was not a man who would do other than support Esmarelda in whatever continuing relationship she would wish as an adult to have with her father. It was notable to me that the applicant when asked about the expert evidence that an order in this jurisdiction would be as it has been put &#8216;doubtful&#8217; to have any effect in Country F, was not troubled by that. It was, he told me, about recognition legally of their lives &#8211; and continuing lives into Esmarelda's adulthood &#8211; here in this country. </p>

By way of practical example, suppose that the child and his adoptive parents return to the country of which he and his natural parents are/were nationals in order to explore his cultural roots; would the adoption order be recognised there and if not, what consequences could flow? This is not to say that an adoption order could not be made if it were to be demonstrated that it would not be recognised in a country which may be of importance for the child in future but it would be a factor that would need to be weighed in the balance, along with all the others, in deciding what order is going to be most conducive to the child's welfare throughout his life&#8217;.</span></p>

The evidence before me is that Esmarelda is intending to retain her Country F citizenship when she applies for British citizenship in the future.&#160;&#160;The expert evidence I have is that the acquisition of British citizenship will neither extinguish nor jeopardise her Country F citizenship.</p>

They have a close and loving attachment. It is he who has shared the parental role with the mother, living together as a family since 2016. &#8216;De facto&#8217; family ties have existed between the mother and applicant for many years, and between him and Esmarelda for many years. It is a settled family unit. The adoption will consolidate and formalise those ties.&#160;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Esmarelda has indicated a strong wish to be adopted. I must have regard to those wishes and feelings. Even in the unusual circumstances of this case I do not approach it on the basis that Esmarelda's views have decisive weight, but they have a weight that comes close to it. When Esmarelda says to this Court <span style="font-style:italic">the only thing that matters to me here is the legal binding document of proof that I have a whole family</span> and that <span style="font-style:italic">Adoption would mean that I feel like a complete part of the family </span>that echoes a depth of feeling expressed consistently throughout. I accept also it comes with an understanding of the immediate and long-term implications of an adoption order which the fact that Esmarelda is an adult carries with it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is of course when I consider the effect on Esmarelda throughout her life, particular significance to the life-long impact upon her relationship with her birth father and with her paternal half siblings.  There is also however the life-long impact which there will be, for her of becoming legally, as well as in the other respects of which the applicant spoke to me from the witness box, the applicant&#8217;s daughter.  When the applicant spoke of his pride of Esmarelda embarking into adulthood, he was clearly speaking of the person he regards, in his heart, as his adult daughter. I agree that she should be his adult daughter legally also. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before making an adoption order, I am required to consider whether there should be arrangements for allowing any person contact with the child; and for that purpose the court must consider any existing or proposed arrangements and obtain any views of the parties to the proceedings (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/46/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 46(6)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>). That is a mandatory requirement which must be explicitly considered by the court (See King LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re L</span> &#167;62). I explicitly consider it here. It should, as good practice, be dealt with as a specific issue, either in the judgment or in a recital to the order. In this unusual case, Esmarelda is already 18. Should she wish to pursue contact with her father as an adult she is able to do so. I do not regard it as necessary for compliance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/46/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 46(6)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> for that to appear on the face of any order but for the avoidance of doubt I have taken account of it here. </p>
