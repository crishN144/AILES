I am grateful to counsel, Ms Mehvish Chaudhry (instructed by Hanne and Co who have produced a commendable paperless trial bundle) for the applicant father, to Ms Claire Renton (via the direct access scheme), and to the respondent mother, for their concise written and oral submissions and for agreeing that the only oral evidence that I was required to hear to determine this matter was that of the High Court Team Cafcass officer, Ms T Jolly and the consultant forensic psychiatrist: Dr T L McClintock. I have conducted this hearing entirely by &#8220;Microsoft Teams&#8221;, organised by the RCJ staff, seamlessly.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Fifteen weeks ago, on Tuesday 28 July 2020 (after a week of a school term that ends in September), after spending the previous night at his father&#8217;s home (and 9 days and nights in early July), R was collected by his mother from school. According to her (through counsel) she told R, while they were leaving school that she had booked flights to England to depart later that day and that he &#8216;&#8230;punched the air with joy&#8230;&#8217; but that she gave him a choice and would not have removed him from the country if he had said &#8220;No&#8221;. Her plan was permanently to relocate to England and live with her husband (AD) who she married on 6 April 2018 and who lives in the England and with whom she had been conducting a long-distance relationship since 2016. Through her counsel, Ms Renton, she has confirmed to me that when she boarded the (one-way ticketed) flight to England on 28 July 2020, with R, she did not know about the 1980 Hague Convention. That is a tremendous shame for her, the father and most importantly for R. On 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2020 the mother sent the father the following message: </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;R and I have come to England. Monday was really distressing for R and when he came back on Tuesday, he said L hit him again on the head so he ran upstairs and hid in M&#8217;s bathroom where no one really goes. You can call him anytime, either by FaceTime on Rs&#8217; iPad or on my phone but for now I am keeping him out of harms way. He is fine, very happy to reunite with his family and is enjoying being with them&#8221;.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Up until then, the father had no idea that his son had been unilaterally and wrongfully removed from Australia. It must have come as a complete shock to him and R&#8217;s elder brothers (from the father&#8217;s previous relationship: L (23), M (18) and N (17)) the rest of R&#8217;s paternal family and his close friends. On the mother&#8217;s account of course, R only knew on the day that he was relocating to England, she says he knew it was imminent from 21 July when she applied for Covid-19 travel exemption clearance to leave and told him she had applied. But for reasons that I shall set out below, I find the former part of my previous sentence highly unlikely. Even if the mother was telling the truth on that (and I am supported in this view by Ms Jolly) such a sudden dislocation and relocation of a child&#8217;s life cannot have been good for him emotionally.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">At the beginning of the English Michaelmas school term, the mother placed R in a local school and did not mention the father to the head teacher. The mother has been represented by very experienced counsel since the first <span style="font-style:italic">inter partes</span> hearing in this matter on 4 September 2020, who no doubt has assisted her client on the &#8216;steep learning curve&#8217; that respondents to Hague Convention applications often face. This was after the father had signed his request for the child&#8217;s return on 3 August 2020 via the Australian and UK Central Authorities, obtained  Legal Aid on 19 August 2020 and sought the usual Tipstaff and other orders to start these proceedings on  4 August 2020, within a month of removal.

The fact that I am writing this judgment after hearing oral evidence and submissions and reading the bundle (which together with the other documents amounts to about 500 pages) amply illustrates that the mother has defended this application to the hilt. How much of this judgment is relevant at the &#8216;full welfare&#8217; stage is a matter for the court that is dealing with R&#8217;s interim and long-term welfare decisions.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I caution myself to make no moral condemnation of the mother&#8217;s actions, the simple task for me today is to decide, on a summary basis, whether the mother has satisfied me that she has raised a defence under the 1980 Hague Convention and if so, whether I should exercise my discretion not to return R forthwith to Australia. It is rightly conceded by Ms Renton that Article 3 (habitual residence and the exercise of rights of custody at the material time) have been made out by the applicant father. She raises two defences, namely that the child objects to returning to Australia and <span style="font-style:italic">that &#8220;&#8230;the impact on the mother&#8217;s parenting capacity is so severe that the child is at grave risk of severe psychological harm&#8221;</span> (from para.24 of her skeleton argument) and that the situation would become intolerable for R.

I believe your matter in Sydney if its running will probably take another two years noting you have already applied for an urgency at the beginning and it was denied. Your matter is currently waiting the allocation of a judge and has been waiting since last year once a judge is appointed we will then be directed to obtain an expert report which could take 6 to 8 months or more because many experts have a back log and are difficult to get into. If Boland is used her wait list is enormous, so after that we would then be allocated a hearing. The Court may give you a slight preference for urgency at that stage as often they will for relocation but you have to wait to get to that point. It would be far better for you to remain in England and have your matter determined. </p>

The essence of its conclusion, as set out below, is that the wording of Article 13(b) itself restricts its scope. I would add that, sometimes, as in the <span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Good Practice</span>, at [25], it is suggested that this Article, as an exception to the obligation to order a child's return, is to be "applied restrictively". Sometimes, as in <span style="font-style:italic">In re E</span>, it is suggested that the Article is "of restricted application". These are nuanced not substantive differences because the underlying principle is the same, namely the Article has a high threshold for its application and, as a result, the scope for its application is limited.  </p>

It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be "real". It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as "grave". Although "grave" characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two. Thus a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as "grave" while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm. </p>

Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress. It is part of growing up. But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself. Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent. Mr Turner accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: e g, where a mother's subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child." </p>

As has often been pointed out, this is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person, institution or other body who has requested her return, although of course it may be so if that person has the right so to demand. More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home. Mr Turner accepts that if the risk is serious enough to fall within article 13(b) the court is not only concerned with the child's immediate future, because the need for effective protection may persist." </p>

No doubt a court will look very critically at an assertion of intense anxieties not based upon objective risk; and will, among other things, ask itself whether they can be dispelled. But in <span style="font-style:italic">In re E</span> it was this court's clear view that such anxieties could in principle found the defence. Thus, at para 34, it recorded, with approval, a concession by Mr Turner QC, who was counsel for the father in that case, that, if there was a grave risk that the child would be placed in an intolerable situation, "the source of it is irrelevant: eg, where a mother's subjective perception of events lead to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child".

No attempt was made to persuade the Court of Appeal that reference to "preferences" was inappropriate in this context and, in the Supreme Court, Lord Wilson referred to the phraseology without apparent disapproval (see &#167;8 and &#167;17). I do not see it as a gloss on the Convention or as a term of art but rather as one way of summarising that, for reasons which will differ from case to case, the child's views fall short of an objection.  </p>

In many cases the abducting parent returns with the child and retains the child until the court has made a decision as to the child's future. The problem arises when the mother decides not to return with the child. It would be artificial to dissociate the country from the carer in the latter case and to refuse to listen to the child on so technical a ground. I disagree with the contrary interpretation given by Johnson J in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">B v K (Child Abduction)</span> [1993] Fam Law 17. Such an approach would be incompatible with the recognition by the Contracting States signing the Convention that there are cases where the welfare of the child requires the court to listen to him. It would also fail to take into account article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989. From the child's point of view the place and the person in those circumstances become the same&#8230;.I am satisfied that the wording of article 13 does not inhibit a court from considering the objections of a child to returning to a parent."  </p>

Yet until the case reached this House, no defence based on the child's objections was raised. This is not surprising. A was only four and a half when these proceedings were begun. At that age few courts would accept that he has "attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views". But he is now more than eight years old and he was more than seven and a half when these proceedings were heard by the trial judge. As any parent who has ever asked a child what he wants for tea knows, there is a large difference between taking account of a child's views and doing what he wants. Especially in Hague Convention cases, the relevance of the child's views to the issues in the case may be limited. But there is now a growing understanding of the importance of listening to the children involved in children's cases. It is the child, more than anyone else, who will have to live with what the court decides. Those who do listen to children understand that they often have a point of view which is quite distinct from that of the person looking after them. They are quite capable of being moral actors in their own right. Just as the adults may have to do what the court decides whether they like it or not, so may the child. But that is no more a reason for failing to hear what the child has to say than it is for refusing to hear the parents' views. </p>

He was very clear that 1 in 4 people suffer from anxiety from time-to-time and that we must not confuse anxiety with depression. He said that the mother had dealt well with a period of depression in the past and repeats what she said in his report, namely that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;In my opinion she is suffering from an acute stress reaction because of her situation and although to A, her symptoms have an overwhelming quality, in psychiatric terms her condition is at the less severe end of the spectrum&#8221;</span>.

His medical notes have been disclosed and there is nothing to support the case that he was suffering &#8220;severe symptoms of anxiety for years that were intolerable to him&#8221;. There is mention of neck movements and a pain and tick but nothing more and no expert evidence from Dr McClintock of an equivalent has (rightly) been sort. Indeed, the child&#8217;s presentation to the Cafcass officer was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230;friendly, polite [and] bright&#8221; </span>and there is no evidence from his Australian or English schools that support the picture that the mother paints in her written evidence of an anxious boy.  </p>

On interview with Ms Jolly (which lasted 90 minutes) R stated: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;My dad is being sort of bullying, and one of my brothers is bullying me in Australia and I want to stay here and they&#8217;re forcing me to come back. I want to stay here because I like it here&#8230;.

I have lots of fun here.&#8221; </span>And bearing in mind the dicta of Black LJ (as was) I am compelled to say that this child is objecting to returning to Australia; it is questionable as to whether R is actually objecting to return to the country of his habitual residence but rather to the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;particular circumstances in that country&#8217; </span>but the two have conflated in his mind as I said I accept the gateway has been crossed.</p>

Ms Jolly, who is very experienced, gave evidence before me yesterday. She was quite clear in her written and oral evidence that this little boy is in an invidious position. He has known for some time that his mother has wanted to relocate to England. He has known about the Court relocation application and on the mother&#8217;s case (as confirmed by Ms Renton) knew about the Travel Restriction exemption request on 21 July 2020.  </p>

This document is dated as long ago as 27 May 2020 - 2 months before the removal of R to England. The mother has produced a final shipment advice stating that the shipping crate left from Liverpool on 23 August 2020 but I fail to see how this latter document detracts from the former, which obviously shows that the mother planned to leave with R as long ago as May 2020.  </p>

I have to answer that it was likely. I also find that, as R told Ms Jolly, he knew at least a day and half before arriving in England that he was leaving Australia (and by that I take it before boarding the aeroplane) and this means that the night before he left (when he was at his father&#8217;s home on 27 July 2020), he kept it secret from him and his brothers.

Even though he states or even feels that he was given the determinative choice over the move: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;my mother said we can go to England if you want&#8230;&#8221;</span> such is his devotion to his mother and she knows it, as any parent would, he was being beguiled into agreeing to the move and still is. By the time of the Cafcass interview, this boy who had had extensive contact with his father up until the day of departure, could not bear to see his face on the mobile phone for contact, came into the interview citing the word &#8220;aggressive&#8221; and then not knowing what it meant, and stating to Ms Jolly &#8220;&#8230;he does not know if he loves him&#8230;&#8221;.Other signs of recruitment to the mother&#8217;s cause and believing her narrative are the way that he spoke rapidly, which caused Ms Jolly to ask him to pause: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;R would do so only momentarily before continuing his account.&#8221; </span> His complete lack of balance and nuance in his description of his parents in his supporting of his mother&#8217;s position, his lack of recognition and minimisation of Australia:<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;There are many beaches and lots of deadly animals &#8216;&#8230;and other stuff I can&#8217;t really remember because I have been here for 2 months&#8230;and its really hot there&#8217;.&#8221;</span> This is why in her written conclusion Ms Jolly says as follows:</p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.04in">The extent of which R&#8217;s expressed views and wishes can said to be his own is difficult to distinguish. This is a young child who is aware of a longstanding wish by his mother to relocate to this country with him. There is much at stake here and I am sure R believes he carries some responsibility for helping to ensure he and his mother remain here. It can be difficult to express a view other than the person in whose care a child is in every day, and for them to give a more balanced perspective of life in the country they have left behind. R informing me that he was given a choice, is in my casework experience not uncommon for children seeking to deter any criticism of wrongdoing from their parent. There is an indicator of parental influence, even unintentional, by R overhearing adult discussions about his father lying at court. R presented as a child keen to relay his narrative which in many instances also accords to the information A has provided for these proceedings&#8221;.  </p>

We were waiting for that a long time perhaps two months&#8230;&#8221; means that he feels that he has responsibility in the decision, to leave Australia. Obviously, Ms Jolly&#8217;s involvement has been nowhere near the in-depth assessment of Dr Boland in Australia and upon reading para 154 of the latter&#8217;s report from 2015, Ms Jolly stated that she did not get a fully accurate picture of R&#8217;s relationships and that she found his unwillingness to accept anything positive about his life and relationships in Australia: troubling. &#8220;R is extremely aware of his mother&#8217;s wishes&#8221;, she agreed that he is in what is often called the bubble of respite right now and said that his anger towards his father stems from a coping mechanism which recognises that he would be alleviated from the dispute between his parents if only his father would agree to the move. R was keen to relay a negative narrative of his father and to &#8216;get things out&#8217; and remember everything &#8216;&#8230;don&#8217;t forget&#8230;&#8217; was how Ms Jolly characterised his interview with her. He had an awareness of how important the interview was, and she said that it was possible his responses were rehearsed. Part of R&#8217;s complaint is that his father does not give him enough attention when he is with him and he is left to his own devices and forced to play video games. To my mind, I find that if this is true, this shows a desire for more time with his father rather than far less, which is what is happening now.  </p>

I find that the boy who spoke to Cafcass in such trenchant terms may not have known about the exact flight he was leaving on until 27 July 2020 but certainly knew of his mother&#8217;s unilateral plans to relocate from Australia well in advance of the trip and was actively recruited to the cause.  </p>

The courts there are seised with the case. The mother should not profit from her wrongful actions unless there is a constellation of factors militating towards the child benefitting from staying here. There is no such constellation here. The Australian proceedings are far advanced, a psychologist, Dr Boland has already met R in 2015 and there is talk of her being reinstructed in the relocation application (by the mother&#8217;s own lawyers). The parties have Australian solicitors (the mother has none here) and can hit the ground running with applications for urgent hearings and expedition. Added to this is the simple fact that it will be nigh on impossible for a court to make any indepth assessment until such time that R and the parents are living in the same country.    </p>

R has &#8220;&#8230;a level of cognitive, emotional and social maturity commensurate with his age and stage of development&#8221; (Ms Jolly). At the mere age of 8 years old I must not place him in the centre of this debate, he has had to carry enough responsibility on his young shoulders already. I also ask myself whether, at this age he actually understands what long-term relocation means for him, his Australian family and &#8216;best mates&#8221;.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.13in;margin-right:0.04in">R has attended School in Australia since kindergarten and is currently in Year 2. He was removed without saying goodbye to anyone least of all his school, which was simply terminated. The English school have noted &#8216;a discrepancy between R&#8217;s abilities and what is expected academically for a child of his age&#8217;. I find this unsurprising in view of what he has been through recently.  July was the beginning of the third academic term in Australia and this woeful situation must be corrected as soon as possible. It is in R&#8217;s academic best interests to return to his old school, learn what he has missed and for <span style="font-style:italic">the status quo ante</span> to be in place.  </p>

I gather he is very worried about recent developments and what R was saying to him the night before he left Australia.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I have looked at the undertakings that the father has offered in comparison to the mother&#8217;s request and in the knowledge that the mother has lived and supported herself in Australia (and for periods without her own mother or sister) for almost two decades. She has &#163;11,000, is able bodied and her son is not a babe in arms. In Dr McClintock&#8217;s words: &#8220;She needs to help herself&#8221; to medication if she needs it, as many people have to do from time to time when faced with anxiety. What the father is offering provides for more than adequate arrangements upon return. I am not interfering with the existing order of 2016 of Judge Dunkley, I have no jurisdiction or inclination to do so and I am not asking the father to undertake not to have any contact (&#8216;save as agreed&#8217;) with R after arrival until a court hearing. Perversely, the mother is open to unsupervised staying holiday contact taking place in Australia between R and his father and brothers (as is R) but if I order her to return now with R she does not agree to any direct contact until there has been a court hearing. I find this approach truculent and not focussed on the child. Also, the very fact that she agrees to holiday contact of course torpedoes any alleged concerns that she has about the father&#8217;s care of R in any event.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">What this position does show is that the mother wants still to dictate the contact that the father can have with R with no logical explanation. Her actions in unilaterally removing R and recruiting him to not tell his father and brothers  (and school mates) that he is about to leave them permanently, and create an environment where R is angry at his father for having the temerity to want him back and refuses even to allow him to see him again via FaceTime contract (by titling the phone to the ceiling), fills one with dread that the mother&#8217;s actions might be symptoms of a deeper wish to eradicate the father and his sons&#8217; society from  R&#8217;s life.  </p>
