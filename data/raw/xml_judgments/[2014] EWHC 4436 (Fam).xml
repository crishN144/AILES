During the course of this hearing, I have heard much of that foster placement and, in particular, SS's relationship with her foster carer.  Secure Accommodation is a very limited resource.  It is sparsely scattered across the country and there are very few units designated solely for welfare purposes: Most establishments cater for young offenders as well. I have been told the integration of these two groups, though it may be counter intuitive to the lawyer, can sometimes lead to the development of mutually positive relationships.  This is merely anecdotal and I will say no more about it, I am simply not in a position to judge. </span></p>

The first is her social worker, a Mr. Omoriyekewmen, and the second her foster carer.  Hundreds of miles away from both of them, in this secure unit, she has been able to see her social worker only once, and unable to see her foster carer at all.  I find it, I am bound to say, profoundly troubling that children who are accommodated in secure units for their protection, frequently find themselves so far away from those who care for them.  In the context of a criminal offender, great care would be taken to keep prisoners, particularly vulnerable youngsters, near their families wherever possible, recognising the importance of the support.  This sad consequence, though, arises from the fact that there are very few units actually available.</span></p>

It is for this reason that the process is tightly regulated by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> in the way I have set out, but also in the Children (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 1991 and the Children (Secure Accommodation No.2) Regulations 1991. The use of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref> will very rarely be appropriate and it must always remain a measure of last resort.  By this I mean not merely that the conventional options for a child in care must have been exhausted but so too must the &#8216;unconventional&#8217;, i.e. the creative alternative packages of support that resourceful social workers can devise when given time, space and, of course, finances to do so. Nor should the fact that a particular type of placement may not have worked well for the child in the past mean that it should not be tried again.  Locking a child up (I make no apology for the bluntness of the language, for that is how these young people see it and, ultimately, that is what is involved) is corrosive of a young persons spirit.  It sends a subliminal and unintended message that the child has done wrong which all too often will compound his problems rather than form part of a solution.</span></p>

At very short notice, the deputy principal was able to make herself available.  She told me that, for young women in the situation of SS, such units could only really try and achieve one objective and that was to keep the young people concerned safe in a time of crisis "only long enough to find them somewhere more suitable".

I am, however, entirely satisfied that she is likely to abscond in the future, if not in secure accommodation, in the sense that there is a real possibility of her absconding.  I am absolutely sure that she is at risk of significant emotional and/or physical harm were she to do so.  Whilst in the unit, she was submitted to a "screening psychological test", as it has been referred to; it indicates that she needs a nurturing environment which is predictable, in which boundaries and rules are consistently and fairly applied and where her engagement with boundaries is positively reinforced.</span></p>

She had told the doctor that she is reluctant to address this or think about it at this time.  She may choose, and if she does, should be offered the opportunity to gain access to some further assessment and, potentially, further intervention.

But it has taken nearly five weeks for her merely to be assessed, let alone to identify and put in place the kind of therapeutic support which it is generally believed she needs. With, to my mind, refreshing candour, the social worker acknowledged that, at the conclusion of three months, which is the maximum period for which an order can be made without review of the court, he was likely to apply for a further order so that the therapeutic work could continue.  It may be a mere typographical error, but, in the paperwork, a period of six months for the secure accommodation is referred to.  Whilst he stuck to his primary proposal, I felt that he moved further from it as his evidence progressed and as he reflected, both on the reality of the regime and the impact which it was having on SS.  It is plain that SS has, whilst, initially, making a brave fist of the programme, come to feel its privations to be corrosive to her general sense of wellbeing, or, as she puts it, it makes her feel as if she is "dying within".</span></p>

She believed that a setting which reinforced a therapeutic programme 24 hours a day, seven days a week was likely to be more effective.

But the State can only provide such facilities as it can and not only are none now available but I have heard of no prospect of them becoming available in anything like SS's own timescales.
