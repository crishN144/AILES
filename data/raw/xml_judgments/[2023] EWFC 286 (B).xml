	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">I am concerned with the father&#8217;s application for permission to appeal a private law order made by District Judge Webb on 26 September 2023 following a two-day hearing. The order provided for the children, A (aged 4) and F (aged two), to live with the mother and for her to be given permission to relocate with them to Germany. For convenience, I shall refer to the parties as the father and the mother. The father was represented by Ms Cooper and the mother by Mr Shama. Both have provided written submissions for the purpose of this application for which I am grateful.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">The father is British and the mother German. The mother moved to Wales in December 2018 prior to A&#8217;s birth. Both children were born in Wales and lived in England. By agreement they spent extended time in Germany with their mother and extended family. The children are bilingual. A started school in Y in September 2023 and prior to this attended pre-school. F was to commence the same pre-school in January 2024. There appears to be no dispute that whilst the mother has not applied for settled status, such would be likely to be granted.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">In February 2023 the father issued an urgent application to prevent the mother from removing the children from the jurisdiction. This was granted and the children lived primarily with the father spending time with the mother at weekends. The mother then issued an application to relocate with the children to Germany. At one point she claimed they were habitually resident in Germany but quickly withdrew this before making the application heard by the judge. The mother was always clear that she would relocate even if the children were not able to go with her.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">An appeal does not operate as a stay of any order or decision of the lower court unless the appeal court orders otherwise. In deciding whether or not to grant a stay the essential question is whether there is a risk of injustice to one or other of both parties if the court grants or refuses a stay (<span style="font-style:italic">Hammond Suddard v Agrichem International Holdings Limited </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2001/2065" uk:canonical="[2001] EWCA Civ 2065" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] EWCA Civ 2065</ref>). The court must therefore carry out a balancing exercise. There is further assistance as to the relevant principles which were distilled in <span style="font-style:italic">Wenden Engineering Services C Ltd v Lee Shing UEY Construction Co Ltd </span>HCCT 90/1999 in which it was stated:</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:-0.01in">&#8216;From these authorities I derive the following five principles &#8230; First, the court must take into account all the circumstances of the case. Second a stay is the exception rather than the general rule. Third, the party seeking a stay should provide cogent evidence that the appeal will be stifled or rendered nugatory unless a stay is granted. Fourth, in exercising its discretion the court applies what is in effect the balance of harm test in which the likely prejudice to the successful party must be considered. Fifth, the court should take into account the prospects of the appeal succeeding. Only where strong grounds of appeal or a strong likelihood of success is shown should a stay be considered.<span style="font-style:italic">&#8217;</span></p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">In considering the application, I have taken into account all the circumstances of the case. A stay is an exception rather than the norm. Rather than provide evidence that the appeal would be rendered nugatory, the father has taken the law into his own hands and retained the children&#8217;s passports. If the appeal is successful, then this would disrupt the mother&#8217;s ability to relocate. When considering the balance of harm test, the parties agreed the move would take place during the October half term (paragraph 8 of the order). It appears the father accepted that any delay with the move would be harmful particularly from an educational point of view for the children and for this reason it was agreed half term was preferable rather than the move taking place at say Christmas. It cannot be in the interests of A for there to be any further delay from an education point of view if she is to move to Germany. F is also to start nursery in January. Finally, for reasons to which I will return I am not persuaded the appeal has strong grounds. Whilst a temporary stay was granted by HHJ Willsteed on 25 October 2023, it would be open to me to refuse the application at this stage. However, in order to be completely fair to the father, I have continued the stay for 7 days should he seek an oral hearing.</p>

The judge set out the events leading to the father&#8217;s application which was motivated by what he thought was the mother&#8217;s intention to relocate to America. The judge went on to state that even if he did not refer to every piece of evidence, he had weighed it into his evaluation. He gave himself a <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas </span>direction although, rightly, did not consider such to be strictly necessary. He set out the parties&#8217; positions namely for the children to remain in England with the father (with the mother returning to Germany) or the children relocating with the mother. In light of some of the submissions made by the father, it is important to note that the judge was only faced with two options.</p>

The mother was noted to have provided clear details of where the children would live in Germany. The father&#8217;s position was noted to be more complicated. A reference was made to &#8216;rather shadowy figures&#8217; in respect of the father&#8217;s family. The step-father was noted to have an alcohol problem (this was not challenged). The judge was also concerned about the father potentially living in the main house and the children in the annex. The father&#8217;s plan to move to either a purchased or rented home was undefined and this certainly appeared to be the case in terms of timescales. On the basis of the evidence before him, the judge considered the mother to be better placed to meet the children&#8217;s physical needs.</p>

It was not the move itself that would cause harm but the loss of the presence. The judge was confident that the relationship with the left behind parent would remain strong albeit it would be different. The judge considered the mother&#8217;s lack of relationship with her father which the father asserted evidenced risk. He did not accept this was the case. The judge noted the mother was not going to stay in England regardless of the decision in respect of her application. Both parents would be devastated unless the outcome of the application went in their favour. However, as the mother had been the primary carer for the majority of the children&#8217;s lives on balance she would be more adversely affected. Only in the short-term would it adversely impact upon their ability to care. In the longer term both would adjust but again on balance the judge considered the mother would be more affected in respect of her parenting ability.</p>

I have found the support network for Ms T in Germany and the stability of her accommodation means she is in a position to provide a safe environment surrounded by family to deal with this period of trauma.

If it is said to be an error of the law, I am not persuaded that can be right. In my view the judge carefully considered the report and the oral evidence of the officer as well as that of the parties. It is apparent that the officer was asked at length about the focus of her recommendation being on the change of circumstances. The judge was aware of the importance of the officer&#8217;s evidence. However, he was entitled to depart from it so long as he gave clear reasons for doing so. It is apparent he did not consider the officer&#8217;s recommendation undertook a side-by-side analysis that holistically considered the parties&#8217; proposals. In the judge&#8217;s view the decision of the officer focused on change and her recommendation could not be justified.</p>

Accordingly, there was no evidence for the judge to form such a view when the father had met their needs since February. The father says there was no explanation as to how this differed given that the children would be moving to Germany. It is submitted that the judge placed too much weight on &#8216;shadowy figures&#8217; in the paternal grandmother&#8217;s home and there was no explanation as to how this impacted on the father&#8217;s ability to meet the needs of the children.</p>

However, despite no questions being asked about the father&#8217;s mental health, the judge within his own assessment considered the father&#8217;s health to be vulnerable which was considered equivalent to the mother&#8217;s vulnerability to influence from people she met online. The judge is said to have failed to make an assessment of the mother&#8217;s application for the summary return of the children to Germany which was a factor considered by the officer. The risk of the mother being able to meet the children&#8217;s emotional needs was therefore flawed. The judge is also said to have attached weight to the mother&#8217;s support network which in reality was not in place.</p>

Whilst there was reference to moving to another property it was not clear why this had not happened already. The judge was said to have questioned this. He also had concerns about the step-father&#8217;s use of alcohol (which was not challenged by the father) and grandfather whose physical condition might impact the children. These were said not to have been considered by the officer. The father&#8217;s proposals were said to have lacked practicality. The suggestion at trial that the father would move closer to the school was not sharply defined. It was therefore according to the father open to the judge to prefer the mother&#8217;s evidence in respect of meeting the children&#8217;s physical needs.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.01in">As for the children&#8217;s emotional needs, the mother asserts the judge noted that each proposal would see the loss of a primary caregiver. He noted that prior to February the mother had been the primary caregiver although noted the father&#8217;s increased role. It was therefore more finely balanced and more so than recognised by the officer. The judge went on to consider both parent&#8217;s ability to care for the children and noted the risky element of the mother when she had considered moving to America. The judge also noted the concerns in respect of the father and his mental health although the letter from his GP was considered to be evidentially useless. It was not a live issue, but a potential vulnerability related to the mother&#8217;s behaviour in respect of relocating to America which was addressed and ruled out as being a safeguarding concern. She had simply &#8216;flirted&#8217; with the idea but it was no more than that. The mother asserts that her application under the Hague Convention was considered and noted to be inappropriate but was not found to be evidence of any hostile intentions towards the father. The father&#8217;s concerns of her being estranged from the paternal side of her family were said by the mother not to have been explored in evidence. The mother says there were no concerns about her not adhering to a court order. The treating of their respective vulnerabilities is said therefore to have been entirely within the judge&#8217;s discretion. However, the judge is said to have gone further by considering the mother&#8217;s support network which was well evidenced. This was contrary to the father&#8217;s support network which was lacking in detail. This was important when he planned on returning to work.</p>

The issue in respect of the mother moving to America was fully considered as was the father&#8217;s previous mental health difficulties (which the father accepted) meant the judge had concerns about both parents.

Such an assertion is not supported by the judgment in which the judge considered the impact on parents. The judge started by considering the impact on the mother if the children remained in England and could not form the view that she would stay and in any event it was not for the court to determine where she should live. The impact on the mother would therefore be significant as she had been the primary carer for the majority of their lives she would be devastated by a refusal and accordingly, the impact was likely to be greater than on the father. However, allowing the children to move would have a profound effect on the father. The judge then reminded himself that when considering this part of the checklist he had to consider it in the context of the parents&#8217; ability to care for the children. In the short term this would impact upon both parents but in the longer term the mother was more likely to be adversely affected. On balance the judge concluded this aspect of the checklist fell in favour of the mother and gave appropriate reasons for reaching that conclusion.</p>
