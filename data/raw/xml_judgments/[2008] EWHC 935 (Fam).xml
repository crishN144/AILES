The trial bundles were far more extensive than required.  I have been referred to only a very small number of the documents.  I have also had comprehensive written and oral submissions.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The main factual issue between the parties is the value of the restaurant business owned by the parties and operated by the Husband.  The very substantial difference between the experts derives partly from factual issues, which have an effect on the maintainable earnings for which they each contend, and partly from a significant difference between them as to the appropriate multiple (6 against 9).  When reviewing this aspect of the case, I will have to make such findings as I consider necessary for the purposes of my decision.  However, throughout the hearing I have been concerned at the forensic approach adopted by the parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The experts agree that the exercise they are engaged in is an art and not a science.  As Lord Nicholls said in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller v Miller; McFarlane v McFarlane</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 AC 618" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 AC 618</ref> [26]: &#8220;valuations are often a matter of opinion on which experts differ.  A thorough investigation into these differences can be extremely expensive and of doubtful utility&#8221;.  I understand, of course, that the application of the sharing principle can be said to raise powerful forces in support of detailed accounting.  Why, a party might ask, should my &#8220;share&#8221; be fixed by reference other than to the real values of the assets?  However, this is to misinterpret the exercise in which the court is engaged.  The court is engaged in a broad analysis in the application of its jurisdiction under the Matrimonial Causes Act, not a detailed accounting exercise.  As Lord Nicholls said, detailed accounting is expensive, often of doubtful utility and, certainly in respect of business valuations, will often result in divergent opinions each of which may be based on sound reasoning.  The purpose of valuations, when required, is to assist the court in testing the fairness of the proposed outcome.  It is not to ensure mathematical/accounting accuracy, which is invariably no more than a chimera.  Further, to seek to construct the whole edifice of an award on a business valuation which is no more than a broad, or even very broad, guide is to risk creating an edifice which is unsound and hence likely to be unfair.  In my experience, valuations of shares in private companies are among the most fragile valuations which can be obtained.</p>

By her Open Proposals dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2007 and at the hearing the Wife has sought 50% of the parties&#8217; net assets with child maintenance of &#163;12,000 per year for each child plus the payment of school fees.  Mr Bishop&#8217;s final Schedule values the total wealth at approximately &#163;7.6 million of which the business valuation accounts for approximately &#163;5.3 million.  Mr Bishop, therefore, submits that the Wife should receive &#163;3.8 million.  To achieve this, the Wife would have to receive all the liquid wealth and the Husband would have to borrow approximately &#163;1.6 million through the business.  This is on top of existing borrowings of &#163;1.8 million.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Husband&#8217;s final position has moved from that set out in his Open Proposals dated 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2007.  In those proposals he sought a school fees&#8217; fund of &#163;350,000 and the sale of the former matrimonial home.  It was proposed that the Wife should receive, on a clean break, what was then calculated as being 42% of the remaining wealth, namely approximately &#163;1.7 million of &#163;4 million.  Mr Johnstone&#8217;s final Schedule values the wealth at a total of &#163;4.2 million.  The Husband still seeks the creation of a school fees&#8217; fund but at the reduced level of &#163;260,000.  He also still seeks the sale of the former matrimonial home with the Wife, effectively, receiving all the net proceeds of sale.  In his final submissions, Mr Johnstone submits that the Wife should receive approximately &#163;1.3 million net (after deducting legal costs which Mr Johnstone submits should not be deducted for reasons I will deal with later in this judgment).  It is acknowledged that this is insufficient for a clean break which, it is submitted, would require the Wife to receive an additional &#163;300,000.  It is submitted that this would give the Wife an unfair proportion of the wealth.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having read the papers and each party&#8217;s written arguments, at the outset of the hearing I had formed the provisional view that each party had adopted what I regarded as the most extreme possible position.  Each party clearly faced substantial hurdles in seeking to achieve their respective positions.  It was, of course, only a provisional view, but I was surprised that the parties appeared to consider that the bracket of reasonable orders extended as far in either direction as contended for by them.  I also did not consider that this was a helpful approach for them to have adopted.  To adopt such extreme positions does not assist the court or, in my view, the parties in seeking to achieve a result which is fair both in outcome and in the manner in which it is achieved.  </p>

The marriage broke down finally in 2005 with the Wife filing a new Petition on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2005.  The effective duration of the marriage is, therefore, 15 years.  The Husband left the former matrimonial home in August 2006.</p>

The bank loan is repayable over 10 years with interest being paid at 2% above base rate (currently approximately &#163;285,000 per year).  The capital due has been reduced to &#163;1.8 million.  The loan notes are repayable over 2 years at approximately &#163;175,000 per year and the amount due has reduced to &#163;93,000.</p>

The turnover for the calendar year 1988 was &#163;1.5 million.  For the calendar year 2006 it was &#163;3 million.  The RPI figure for December 1988 was 110.3 and for December 2006 was 202.7.  The 1988 real equivalent would therefore be &#163;2.75 million as against the actual turnover of &#163;3 million, not a very substantial real increase.</p>

In the light of this evidence, it seemed plain to me that the current value of the business reflects the Husband&#8217;s work in it for the past 33 years and, as a result, it would be artificial to seek to define the business as solely matrimonial property.  This contention is based on the fact that until May 2006 the Husband was only a licensee and therefore had no asset with any significant realisable value.  I will return to this point later in this judgment.

I do not propose to deal with all the, frankly legion, disputed factual issues raised during the proceedings.  I will only deal with my conclusions on disputed issues when relevant to my decision.  At times during the evidence it seemed as though the parties could agree about nothing.  I gained the clear impression that both felt constrained to set their respective evidential cases at the highest or lowest possible level.  I have already referred to the distance between the outcomes sought by the parties and this distance was reflected also in their evidence.   I have no doubt that both the Wife and the Husband engaged in extravagant assertions in order better to support their cases.  They also both failed to be sufficiently careful in the written evidence given by them or on their behalf.  The difficulty for a tribunal following such a conclusion, and the consequent loss of confidence in the evidence being given, is how to identify where truth ends and, being generous, hyperbole begins.  If, I have, as a result failed properly to identify this line, in my view the parties have only themselves to blame.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One issue canvassed in the evidence was the extent to which the Husband had deliberately chosen not to seek to increase turnover.  There was said to be little incentive for him doing so as, approximately, 28% of any increase in gross turnover would have to be paid to  the owners.  The Wife contends that the Husband deliberately chose not to develop the restaurant business to its fullest extent because this would largely benefit the owners and give them an incentive to stay and demand more on a sale.  She gave evidence about meetings the parties had had with the Manager in which she says they discussed being able to increase the turnover by as much as 50%.  Although the potential for growth can be an important part of the valuation exercise, ultimately, the experts in this case do not seem to have placed any significant reliance on this factor in arriving at their opinions as to the value of the business.  However, having heard the evidence of both parties on this issue, whilst I can well understand that the structure of the licence fee might have acted as a disincentive, I do not accept that the Husband has deliberately chosen not to maximise the income of the restaurant nor that he has any specific opportunity to enhance the turnover by, for example, increasing the seating.</p>

This has been replaced with &#163;270,000 rent, up to &#163;100,000 rates and approximately &#163;285,000 debt repayments (only the interest of which is tax deductible), a simple difference of approximately &#163;200,000.

The main differences between these two figures are (i) a difference of &#163;50,000 in respect of rates (Mr Epstein takes rent and rates at &#163;370,000 and Mr Nedas &#163;50,000 less); (ii) a difference of &#163;80,000 included by Mr Nedas in respect of benefits allegedly obtained by the family from the business, by way of &#8220;food and lifestyle&#8221; benefits and &#8220;cash and expense&#8221; benefits ; and (iii) a difference of &#163;93,000 added by Mr Nedas to reflect assumed additional profits for the year 2007.  Mr Nedas had originally undertaken a different analysis in respect of future turnover increases but this was not pursued.  In any event, I would have had great difficulty in placing any weight on an average increase in turnover taken from other businesses when the actual increases varied from -24% to + 24%.</p>

In my view, this issue epitomises the danger of treating the valuations in this case as though they provide precise figures.  In March 2007, the local council increased the rates to &#163;100,000 from the previous level of &#163;50,000.  The Husband has joined an appeal by a number of local businesses as a result of being approached by a firm who provide free assistance in appeals.  Payment of their fees is by results.  The appeal process has not yet been concluded and I have no evidence on which I could decide whether the appeal is or is not likely to be successful.  This uncertainty was recognised by Mr Nedas in his oral evidence, when he said that the position would be covered as the sale would probably be negotiated so that the price actually paid would in part be deferred and would be dependant on the outcome of the appeal.  This is all very well but, based on their written valuations, Mr Nedas&#8217; valuation would be &#163;450,000 too high if the appeal fails and, if it succeeds entirely, Mr Epstein&#8217;s value would be &#163;300,000 too low.</p>

He usually got at least two lots of cash in brown envelopes, once a month, of between &#163;1,000 and &#163;1,500, one from Mr F who supplied fruit and vegetables and often came to the house, and the other from the suppliers of meat/fish who did not come to the house.  This went on until he left although by the time of the break up of the marriage H was secretive albeit I saw a lot of cash in his wallet and he used to keep wads of cash in the safe.  Also over the years H has been wont to sell privately champagne, wine and other spirits to customers which he charged the restaurant.  These benefits did not just include food and drink but extensive laundry, dry cleaning and all kitchen implements and equipment in both our homes in London and France.  The cash also was exchanged at local bureau de change for Euro and previously French francs to fund his house in France, paying for over the years substantial new slate roofing (6 bedroom manor house and 3 large attached barns), new central heating and bathroom, windows and doors, gardener and housekeeper, gardening machinery and our supplies whilst we were in France &#8230; We entertained lavishly, sometimes having 20-40 people for the weekend with endless supplies of food and wine.

He questions how a business, which is already achieving very high gross margins, could also be overstating its purchase costs by &#163;80,000 per year.  He also disputes the extent to which a purchaser would be prepared to pay any additional sum in respect of profits which cannot be shown to exist and could not be evidenced.  Mr Nedas appeared rather dismissive of this last point although he did acknowledge that the price paid would probably consist of a base price and an earn out based on a warranted profit figure.  He also made it clear that the accounts would only form a platform for the negotiations, as necessary corrections would be made or revealed during the due diligence exercise.  This again demonstrates the difference between a valuation exercise and an actual sale.  Further, I have considerable difficulty in accepting that a purchaser would pay &#163;720,000 for hidden profits which are based on the owner having allegedly obtained undeclared benefits from the business.</p>

On the other hand, I consider that the Husband has underestimated the benefits received and I do not accept that he has been meeting the family&#8217;s cash expenses solely in the manner claimed by him.  I will deal with the effect of my conclusions on my assessment of the value of the business later in this judgment.</p>

I bear in mind the multiple paid by the Husband in 2006 and the content of the Taylors&#8217; reports.  However, the former was a different type of transaction, as identified by Mr Nedas, and the latter have been largely superseded by the evidence I have heard.  I place greater weight on the average multiples given in Mr White&#8217;s letter with a discount of one-third.  I was not convinced by Mr Nedas&#8217; evidence that a prospective purchaser would not adopt the one third discount referred by Mr White.  A multiple at this level reflects the lower multiples achieved as set out in the table in that letter, most (if not all) of which were not single site restaurants.

Both experts focussed heavily on the fact that it is a business which has been trading in the same format since 1972 and has, therefore, stood the test of time.  This was regarded by them both as being a critical factor influencing its current value.  Whilst, the Husband might have had only a six month licence to sell prior to May 2006 and hence an asset of little realisable value, it would in my view be wholly unrealistic to treat the current value as having been created only in or since 2006.  As I have said, the current value reflects 33 years of endeavour.  I do not consider it appropriate, or indeed possible, to seek to divide this current value into marital and non-marital property.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is trite to say that the pivotal factor in every case is to ensure that the award is fair.  Once the relevant building blocks have been assembled into a provisional structure, it is in my view essential to undertake a global assessment of the fairness of the proposed award.  In the present case, this global assessment immediately leads me to the conclusion that the award proposed by the Wife is not fair for a number of reasons.   It would give the Wife more than all of the available capital and would not, therefore, effect a fair balance in the division of the wealth (principally for the reasons identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Wells v Wells</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 2 FLR 97" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 2 FLR 97</ref>).  Nor would it be fair to require the Husband to sell his business when it has been the focus of his working life since 1974 and when he intends to continue working in it for many years into the future (at least 5/6 years full-time).  It would also result in the selection by me of an arbitrary date which might not be the right time at which to seek to realise the value in the business.  Nor does it properly reflect the fact that the current value in the business is due to the work undertaken by the Husband in it since 1974 &#8211; in other words, if the wealth exceeded needs, I would consider that this case was one in which a departure from mathematical equality was justified.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Such a global assessment also leads me to the conclusion that the award proposed by the Husband would not be fair.  It would not on any view be sufficient to enable the Wife to meet her needs (even if her long term income needs were taken at, say, &#163;50,000, this would require a Duxbury fund of just over &#163;1 million and her housing need is well in excess of &#163;700,000) and it would also not provide her with a fair share of the capital on the basis of a clean break.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I make plain that, in my judgment, this is not a clean break case.  There are insufficient available resources for such a result to be fair.  The extreme positions adopted by the parties, as referred to earlier in this judgment, has been the product of their respective attempts to seek to achieve what I consider to be an unrealistic outcome. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Charman v Charman (No 4)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 1246" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 1246</ref> made clear that the sharing principle applies to all the parties&#8217; property.  This principle is easier in its application when the court is dealing with a clean break.  When there is both a capital award and a continuing order for periodical payments, the assessment of the fairness of the capital award becomes more complex.  It may, or may not, be the extent of the capital received by one spouse depending, for example, on whether the court later exercises it power to award further capital under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> or whether the order for periodical payments ends as a result of the recipient&#8217;s remarriage.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The award I propose to make is as follows.  The available resources of &#163;2 million (being the net amount after payment of the liabilities as referred to in this judgment and taking the assets at their net values) will be divided as to &#163;1.45 million to the Wife and just under &#163;600,000 to the Husband.  I consider it reasonable for the Wife to continue to live in the house in Battersea but with a mortgage in the region of &#163;150,000.  The Husband will be able to purchase accommodation at a cost to him of &#163;850/&#163;900,000 (i.e. with a mortgage in the region of &#163;300,000) either for himself or as a contribution to shared accommodation with Mrs A.  The Wife will also have transferred to her the Canada Life pension, giving her total pension funds of approximately &#163;90,000.  The Wife will, therefore, have total capital assets of just over &#163;1.5 million and the Husband will have just over &#163;3.2 million.  The crude percentages are approximately 32%/68%; the Wife will, however, have 67% of the non-business wealth.  I consider that this is a fair division of the capital on the basis that the Wife continues to receive periodical payments.  It also meets the parties&#8217; respective housing needs.  The Wife will transfer her shares in Y Ltd to the Husband.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to income, I consider that the Wife should receive periodical payments for herself at &#163;60,000 per year, on the basis that the Husband pays &#163;20,000 per year for the children.  This total, of &#163;80,000, is slightly below her budget which also contained no allowance for a mortgage.   In my view it is sufficient to meet her needs and it reflects a fair share of the income available from the business.  The Husband will have to pay the school fees (of between &#163;45,000 and &#163;60,000 per year, once the children leave prep school) and will also have to pay for a mortgage slightly higher than the Wife&#8217;s.  Taking his net income at &#163;250,000 and deducting school fees of, say, &#163;50,000, and maintenance for the children and the Wife totalling &#163;80,000, the Husband will have a net income of &#163;120,000.  This reflects the fact that he is working to generate the income and the fact that he may well have a higher mortgage.</p>
