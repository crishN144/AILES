He accused the social workers of having misled the court.  The DVD included clips of people who were bound and gagged, one of whom had a gun against his head.  He showed some recent photographs of T and some of T&#8217;s social care records.  There was an ultimatum to the local authority to reverse their plan for adoption or he said he would, &#8220;Go public&#8221;.</span></p>

He says he is well informed.  He says the DVD has now had over 350 views.  It has been tweeted to Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and UKIP politicians, and also the CPS, the Ministry of Justice, Sky News, BBC News, ITV News, etc.  He refers to the fact that his trial will be in open court and says the truth about the lies and the misleading of the court will come out.

Mr.&#160;H made some points to me himself.  He told me he had put his neck on the line in taking the actions that he had.  He says he regrets making the comment in court on the last occasion but he does not regret anything he did to expose Suffolk County Council.  He said it is not an attack on Mr.&#160;Jacobs but an attack on Suffolk County Council.  I&#160;certainly gained the impression from what he said that, although he was apologising to me for what he said to Mr.&#160;Jacobs in court, he was indicating that he intended to carry on his campaign.  It certainly appeared that he intended to break this injunction further in the future.  I&#160;will not, of course, be sentencing him for that.  I have found all the breaches proved to the criminal standard.  I make it clear, however, that I will sentence Mr H only for what has happened in the past.</span></p>

He said Mr H was deeply upset by the position he was in but it was not to minimise the seriousness of the situation in respect of the breaches.  He accepted that what he had done was in breach of the order.  He indicated to me that Mr.&#160;H&#8217;s case was that, when he said, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">I am coming for T</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8221;, he meant it not as a threat to remove T from care but rather that he intended to make all legal efforts to have him back in his care, and to continue to challenge the situation. </span></p>

He was not seeking to launch a personal attack.  He did not make any reference to T&#8217;s name or date of birth, and it merely stemmed from his efforts to challenge what he saw was an injustice and a need to respond.  Mr H was unhappy with the injunction, but he was unrepresented so he was not in a position to challenge the injunction that was made.  Mr Nicklin reminded me that there were also criminal proceedings and there should not be double jeopardy.  </span></p>

I have now to sentence you for the breaches that you admit and which I&#160;take the view are very serious.  I&#160;have considered carefully the authorities that have been put before me by your counsel and in particular the dicta in the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Hale v Tanner</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> and in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">A v A</span><span style="font-size:14pt">.  I&#160;accept that imprisonment is not an automatic consequence of the breach of an order and there is no principle that it should be imposed on the first occasion, but equally I&#160;am dealing with you for not only your disobedience to the order but also to ensure that court orders are complied with.  These are very serious breaches.  They have had a serious effect on members of Suffolk County Council who are professional people who are doing their job and are entitled not to be abused or threatened by you.  </span></p>

These are serious breaches and undoubtedly the most serious of them was the threat to Mr.&#160;Jacobs in court which I&#160;take the view was a very serious matter indeed.  I&#160;consider that the contempts are so serious that a fine cannot be justified.  I&#160;also take the view that a suspended sentence of committal cannot be justified either.  I&#160;am therefore going to deal with the matter today and pass a sentence of imprisonment.  This will be the shortest which in my opinion matches the seriousness of your contempt whilst taking into account the mitigating factors raised by your counsel before me.  </span></p>

So that means you will serve in total a sentence of three months in prison.  You will serve only one half of that sentence in custody.  You are at any stage entitled to apply to me to purge your contempt but this will involve you making, in my view, a complete about face in relation to what has occurred to date and an acceptance that in future you will abide by this order completely.  I will consider any application by you to purge your contempt at the time you make it.  </span></p>
