The net result of that was that she was arrested and brought before this court today.

She stated: 'I am not giving them to you.  I do not have any of them'.  I asked her: 'Where is X?'  She replied: 'I will not tell you.  I don't trust police.'

It is right that it does not give the same sort of detail that is in the statement of PC Griffiths.

She went on say that she did not have a valid passport for X.</span></heading>

Her evidence was to the effect that she did not know where X was as she had not seen him since he first went missing some three weeks ago.  He has not contacted her.  She has not contacted the Local Authority because she has a bad relationship with them.  She has not contacted the police.  She has not attempted to find X or to contact X because she does not know where to start, and therefore she is not in breach of paragraph 3 of the order of Holman J.</span></p>

I am satisfied to the criminal standard of proof that she does have knowledge of the whereabouts of X and that she has information that she has not given to this court which might reasonably assist in locating X.  I consider that, if what she said to me was true, she would be at her wits' end.  Her 13 year old son has gone missing in a dangerous capital city.  Yet she has taken no steps whatsoever to find him.  She has taken no steps to contact the authorities.  She said at one point: "I am not out there looking for him as I don't have a clue where he is".  I reject that evidence completely.  I am satisfied to the criminal standard of proof that she has attempted to avoid service of these orders, and that she has done so because she does not wish to co-operate and to assist in the finding of.  She later said in her evidence that she denies telling the police that she would not tell them where he was because she did not trust them.  She told me that she did not shout.  She said that at no point did she shout at the police.  She told me that she behaved thoroughly responsibly at all times.  I simply do not believe that evidence.  I do not believe it to the criminal standard of proof.  If she had come along and said to me that yes, she had been abusive because she did not like being disturbed by the police at 10.30pm, I might have believed her.  I do not accept what she says to me.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Her daughter gave evidence.  I have no reason to doubt her 30 year old daughter's evidence.  Her daughter said that her mother had told her that the police kept coming to her address.  This mother knew very well that the police were trying to find her, and she deliberately kept out of their way.  The reason that she did so was because she has information about X's whereabouts.  I consider it to be, frankly, absurd for her to suggest that this 13 year old boy has gone missing for three weeks and has not, at any stage, attempted to contact her or given her any information.  It is equally absurd to suggest that she has not attempted to contact him or find out any information as to where he might be.  It may be significant that when he was arrested he was near V, which is not very far from where the mother lives.  It suggests that he has come into London where he has not been, I am told, for some two years.  I consider it inconceivable that he would not contact his mother.  I consider it inconceivable that his mother does not know where he is.  I therefore find to the criminal standard of proof that the contempt of paragraph 3(a) and (b) is proved.</span></p>
