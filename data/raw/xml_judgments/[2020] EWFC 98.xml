It may be the case that this reliance on cash was a continuation from the necessity to resort to cash for any private wealth acquisition during the period before 1991 and the relatively recent emergence of private banking, which it was suggested only became the norm after the 1990s. H gave evidence that only companies were commonly using bank accounts from 1990 or 1991 onwards and that at least until the fall of the Soviet Union the only bank accounts which individuals were able to hold were with a state bank and could only be used to pay for utilities and other bills.  </p>

H&#8217;s mother says &#8220;we founded AT Company with five other families each founder invested about $1.5m making the total of about $10m, I provided the entire sum for this investment.  I made this investment on the basis of our usual agreement with H&#8221;.  H says that W chooses the date of 2002 as the commencement of their cohabitation in a naked attempt to boost the size of the marital acquest.  I have dealt with this issue, which is not as clear cut as either party would have me believe. </p>

This was a business operating in H&#8217;s special field of expertise and in which his mother knew nothing.  It was founded at the time when H was on his account a wealthy man and in no need of money from his mother to invest. </p>

According to GS this was the offer made by H.  He said that he was worth about $40m at the time, which he says was the highest net worth he ever achieved, whilst GS put his worth at $50-$55m.  She said that H offered $10m and after some thought she decided to accept it. </p>

When Mr Scott QC asked GS what would have happened if H had dropped dead before payment, she after thought simply said &#8220;well, it didn&#8217;t happen&#8221;.  She said that she had complete confidence that H was a man of his word and that she was bound to receive payment.  She went on to explain that the absence of a written agreement was the result of the fact that it was a peaceful settlement. GS struck me as a thoughtful, intelligent and well-organised lady and I found these answers unconvincing and at odds with, for example, the receipts and the Trust Agreement which she says that she and H entered into. </p>

She doubts very much that he had that sum of money available at that time to give away and she says it is inconsistent with a letter which H read to her in 2002 in which she says GS said that she wanted to make no financial claims whatsoever against H.  GS and H deny that there was any such letter and I consider that this is an example of W gilding the lily.  I cannot see why GS should have written such a letter.  Although she has had a successful career in banking, she was in 2005 very much a middle manager with a student child who needed support.  If she is right, as I am willing to accept, that she had played a significant part in assisting H in creating wealth, it would be surprising if she was willing to give up her claims so easily.   </p>

The first in time to be established was IS Company, with accounts in both Switzerland and Cyprus and registered in the BVI.  L Ltd and K Company were established in the Marshall Islands.  These were the companies whose purpose and activities H&#8217;s mother had difficulties in explaining.  There have been no documents at all produced in respect of any of these companies and so it is impossible for me to know what they hold other than the properties mentioned in this judgment.  In particular, I have no idea of any of their cash balances, although there is evidence that at least in 2017 there were substantial funds in or available to K Company&#8217;s account (see later).  I have been told that IS Company, the third company was liquidated but again there are no documents. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Radmacher v Granatino clearly sets out the court&#8217;s approach to nuptial agreements.  It is important to point out that there is a distinction to be drawn between a contract entered into in anticipation of divorce and one predicated on the continuation of the marriage.  This falls into the latter category. </p>

It is necessary to have black and white rules of this kind if agreements are otherwise to be binding. There is no need for them, however, in the current state of the law. The safeguards in the consultation document are likely to be highly relevant, but we consider that the Court of Appeal was correct in principle to ask whether there was any material lack of disclosure, information or advice. Sound legal advice is obviously desirable, for this will ensure that a party understands the implications of the agreement, and full disclosure of any assets owned by the other party may be necessary to ensure this. But if it is clear that a party is fully aware of the implications of an antenuptial agreement and indifferent to detailed particulars of the other party's assets, there is no need to accord the agreement reduced weight because he or she is unaware of those particulars. What is important is that each party should have all the information that is material to his or her decision, and that each party should intend that the agreement should govern the financial consequences of the marriage coming to an end. </span></p>

Such a conclusion would fit in with when the documents were submitted to Companies House.  It also fits in with the family emails at around this time.  I am not impressed also with the fact that the company&#8217;s registered name was given as being an address which did not become its registered address until 12 October 2018, months after documents prepared by the family had given that as the company&#8217;s address.

H&#8217;s story is that because of Mr IM&#8217;s identity it was agreed between him and W that they would pose as the prospective purchasers as they would be able to get a better price than Mr IM.  This was not a great hardship to H and W as they had time to kill in Miami and had in any event an inchoate plan that at some stage they might take up US residence so that O might complete his education in America.  They were therefore interested in looking at the Miami property market.   </p>

I do not intend to disapprove any of the cases in what I have called the first category, but I agree with the observation of Lord Steyn in McCann's case (at 812) that clarity would be greatly enhanced if the courts said simply that although the proceedings were civil, the nature of the particular issue involved made it appropriate to apply the criminal standard. </span></p>

Lord Nicholls was not laying down any rule of law. There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely. If, for example, it is clear that a child was assaulted by one or other of two people, it would make no sense to start one's reasoning by saying that assaulting children is a serious matter and therefore neither of them is likely to have done so. The fact is that one of them did and the question for the tribunal is simply whether it is more probable that one rather than the other was the perpetrator.&#8221; </span></p>

It is frequently very difficult to tell whether a witness is telling the truth or not; and where there is a conflict of evidence such as there was in the present case, reference to the objective facts and documents, references to the witness' motives and to the overall probabilities can be of very great assistance to a Judge in ascertaining the truth.&#8221; </span></p>

It is therefore extremely difficult to draw any firm conclusions about H (or on his case the family&#8217;s) percentage ownership. H places this at 16.5% and W asserts it to be at least 50%.

H accepts that, for a time in 2018, 50% was owned by his offshore company SOM Ltd but he again asserts that this was as bare nominee on the basis of private agreements and that it does not reflect his true beneficial ownership at any time during the company&#8217;s history.  </p>

Her schedule of costs puts the financial remedy total at &#163;1.67m.  Bearing in mind that this case has overrun by some 3 days, the figure is only likely to be revised upwards.  If interest charged by the litigation lenders is added the total comes to some &#163;2.25m.  Additionally, she has incurred &#163;204k by way of costs in children proceedings with another &#163;90k by way of interest and fees.  Thus, her total expenditure on costs is between &#163;2.5-2.6m inclusive of interest.  This is a very large sum in the context of this case and is to be compared with &#163;305k paid by H, &#163;105k paid by AS and approximately &#163;200k paid by GS.  Amalgamating their costs to a total of &#163;610k and excluding interest costs and children&#8217;s costs, W&#8217;s costs of the financial proceedings are still some 2.5 times that which has been spent by H, AS and GS.   </p>

This is supported by W&#8217;s claimed budget. </p>

I am sure that he was wealthy in 2005 and that since then he has suffered reverses as well as spells of success.  The bulk of the increase will be down to what he already owned in 2005 and will be a development or growth of pre-accrued assets.  I have not been told directly of any completely new business activity as opposed to the expansion of pre-existing business, but the references to CE LLC and to investment in start-up companies give good grounds for believing that there has been such activity. </p>

I am confident that he will have larger resources in Ukraine where he spends most of his time and his business interests are based, albeit that it is probable that some of his wealth is illiquid in the sense of invested in business enterprises.  I am sure that he will have created wealth in the period 2005-2018 to at least the same extent as he did prior to 2005. $40 million, H&#8217;s estimate of his wealth in 2005, is the equivalent to &#163;30 million.   </p>

My award for a clean break is &#163;8 million, which is inclusive of the property assets held in W&#8217;s name and which were given to her during the marriage. This represents a sharing award above W&#8217;s needs, and it will permit her to fund any further litigation in Ukraine without having to have recourse to the needs-based award.  I shall hear counsel as to what properties shall be used to meet that award. </p>
