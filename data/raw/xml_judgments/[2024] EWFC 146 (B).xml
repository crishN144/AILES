It is unlikely that the bruise would be caused by the arm being caught between the mattress and the wall unless there was some forceful impact in addition to this. Bruising would not be expected to be caused by pulling the arm out unless there was forceful grabbing of the arm, more than might be expected to free an arm, or if there was a forceful impact against something while the arm was being pulled out. I think that while this is a possible cause it is less likely.</span></p>

Linear bruises are seen more often in inflicted injuries, however from the diagram I have seen, it is possible this could be from an accidental impact of some description during active play. Mother&#8217;s description of H&#8217;s arm being caught under the mattress and needing to be pulled out could also have caused this bruise if the wrist impacted against a firm edge while being pulled out.

I understand that L was 6 at the time. It is not clear to me whether the position of the children in bed was always what was shown in the photograph, ie. H next to the wall and the other children on the outer part of the bed relative to him, in which case it would be difficult to understand why L might need to kneel on H to get a drink. However, if they were in the position where H was between L and his drink, then I would not expect a young child kneeling on H to cause the bruising either to the groin or to the scrotum. I think this is an unlikely cause for the bruising.</span></p>

L and S are reported to have been 6 and 4 respectively at the time of the injuries. A kick to the scrotum from one of the children could lead to bruising but I would not then expect it to cause bruising in the groin area. In my opinion, this would require more than one impact, would have been painful and that H would have woken up and been distressed. There is recall that S had a disturbed night with coughing and the children were generally unsettled until about midnight but no description of any distress from H until the following morning. Therefore while it is possible that the bruising was from repeated impacts from one or both of the other children in the night, I cannot exclude the possibility that this was inflicted in some other way at another time.</span></p>

Bruising in children could be extremely variable. The bruising to the arm (Injury 1) would require either a forceful impact, impact against an edge or a forceful grab. It would not be caused by merely releasing a trapped arm out from beside the bed unless force was used. A forceful gripping/grab and swing of the arm in line with the mother&#8217;s explanation of catching H before he fell into the coffee table could be an appropriate explanation. In relation to the wrist (Injury 2) she stated that she could not say either way if it was more likely to be accidental or non-accidental, and whilst it was a linear bruise, children can impact things when falling. There were no additional features with the thigh bruising (injury 6) such as petechiae and she was happy that this was more likely to be accidental.</span></p>

She confirmed that S, aged 4, kicking out at H in the night could easily cause the bruising which had occurred &#8211; it was a viable explanation. If not that, then it was a forceful impact with an object. H would have woken and been distressed. The thigh bruises (injury 6) were likely to be accidental in nature, since H was an active mobile child.</span></p>

Her upset at being accused of deliberately hurting H was clear. She explained that she was not the type of person to concentrate on details and timelines, weekends blended together. She had not given much thought to the cause of the injuries until the matter became more involved as she had thought they were not significant. H was not showing distress and apart from the upset when extracted from the bed and when she had grabbed his arm, she had seen no undue distress. He was a lively and active [age]-year-old, as challenging as any other toddler. He was always climbing and running, clumsy and getting scrapes and bruises. She was pressed hard on whether she had been frustrated and lashed out in frustration and she denied this. She gave clear explanations and examples for how she coped with a clingy and anxious [age]-year-old child&#8217;s tantrums and her evidence at no time seemed to be contrived or anything other than honest. Indeed I considered her to be a truthful witness and whilst perhaps an inexperienced new mother, she clearly evidenced age-appropriate coping mechanisms and skills for managing H&#8217;s behaviour and showed no frustration with the forensic and detailed line of questioning. She was polite and respectful throughout even when accused of deliberately hurting H.</span></p>

She indicated that she may not have heard one brief cry out but thought she would have woken for a longer period of crying. In the morning L woke them, telling them that H was stuck and crying. She did not hear him crying. She did not fully see the intervenor release H as she was standing behind. She had not mentioned grabbing H&#8217;s arm to stop him falling until the police interview as she had just thought it was a normal weekend and she was not thinking clearly about it at the time and so much had happened after. She had taken photos to send to the father as she could not get hold of him. It is clear from the text messages that photos are often exchanged between them and they have an excellent working relationship. She had not noticed the bruising underneath as she had simply not looked, the shredded nappy was clean. She had just seen the bruising as one and H was not showing any distress.</span></p>

He was obviously loyal to the mother but also clear that if he had any concerns, he would have acted upon them. He had never seen her hit or kick out at H nor had she made jokey comments about harming him. Again his live evidence reflected his written statement and I will address it only briefly. He had no concerns that mother had injured H deliberately and considered her to be an excellent mother. He was not concerned that mother had not been worried about the bruising as H was fine, his demeanour was the same as usual. They had not colluded. He himself had not looked at or seen H unclothed save for a bath time with bubbles and chaos and when the mother showed him, they each looked after their own children in the main.</span></p>

He clearly has a goods relationship with the mother and as a result of these proceedings he has been able to see the Intervenor&#8217;s behaviour frequently too. It remains a supportive blended family unit, indeed originally, he would stay over night at the mother&#8217;s property to facilitate further contact until some life changes for himself.  He has no doubts as to the mother&#8217;s ability to parent H and no cause for concern. He has seen mother frustrated by H but she has dealt with it reasonably and not shouted at him. He too has seen and dealt with H&#8217;s tantrums, H can have tantrums on and off all day.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in;text-indent:0.2in"><span style="font-family:Arial">In determining the issues at this fact finding hearing I apply the following principles. First, the burden of proof lies with the local authority. It is the local authority that brings these proceedings and identifies the findings they invite the court to make. Therefore, the burden of proving the allegations rests with the local authority.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in;text-indent:0.2in"><span style="font-family:Arial">Secondly, the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities (Re B [2008] UKHL 35). If the local authority proves on the balance of probabilities that J has sustained non-accidental injuries inflicted by one of his parents, this court will treat that fact as established and all future decisions concerning his future will be based on that finding. Equally, if the local authority fails to prove that J was injured by one of his parents, the court will disregard the allegation completely. As Lord Hoffmann observed in Re B:</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-family:Arial">"If a legal rule requires the facts to be proved (a 'fact in issue') a judge must decide whether or not it happened.

As Munby LJ, as he then was, observed in Re A (A Child) (Fact-finding hearing: Speculation) [2011] EWCA Civ 12: "It is an elementary proposition that findings of fact must be based on evidence, including inferences that can properly be drawn from the evidence and not on suspicion or speculation."</span></p>

Whilst appropriate attention must be paid to the opinion of medical experts, those opinions need to be considered in the context of all the other evidence. The roles of the court and the expert are distinct. It is the court that is in the position to weigh up expert evidence against the other evidence (see A County Council &amp; K, D, &amp;L [2005] EWHC 144 (Fam); [2005] 1 FLR 851 per Charles J). Thus, there may be cases, if the medical opinion evidence is that there is nothing diagnostic of non-accidental injury, where a judge, having considered all the evidence, reaches the conclusion that is at variance from that reached by the medical experts.</span></p>

The court must be careful to ensure that each expert keeps within the bounds of their own expertise and defers, where appropriate, to the expertise of others (see observations of King J in Re S [2009] EWHC 2115bFam).</span></p>

The court must be careful to bear in mind that a witness may lie for many reasons, such as shame, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear and distress, and the fact that a witness has lied about some matters does not mean that he or she has lied about everything (see R v Lucas [1981] QB 720).</span></p>

In order to make a finding that a particular person was the perpetrator of non-accidental injury the court must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities. It is always desirable, where possible, for the perpetrator of non-accidental injury to be identified both in the public interest and in the interest of the child, although where it is impossible for a judge to find on the balance of probabilities, for example that Parent A rather than Parent B caused the injury, then neither can be excluded from the pool and the judge should not strain to do so (see Re D (Children) [2009] 2 FLR 668, Re SB (Children) [2010] 1 FLR 1161).&#8221;</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-family:Arial">&#8220;To these matters, I would only add that in cases where repeated accounts are given of events surrounding injury and death, the court must think carefully about the significance or otherwise of any reported discrepancies. They may arise for a number of reasons. One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability. Another is that they are lies told for other reasons. Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others. As memory fades, a desire to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural &#8211; a process that might inelegantly be described as "story-creep" may occur without any necessary inference of bad faith&#8221;.</span></p>

In coming to a conclusion each person should be considered individually by reference to all of the evidence. Glosses such as 'straining' to identify a perpetrator should be avoided.

There are many reasons for this which do not denote guilt, for example, fear, shame, loyalty, panic and distress. An innocent person may lie to bolster their case. A lie should never be considered as direct proof of guilt. In criminal proceedings, to be capable of amounting to corroboration a lie must be deliberate, relate to a material issue and be motivated by a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. The same principle applies here. This point was emphasized again in Re A, B and C (Children) [2021] EWCA Civ 451.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in;text-indent:0.2in"><span style="font-family:Arial">Failure to protect comes in innumerable guises. It often relates to a mother who has covered up for a partner who has physically or sexually abused her child or, one who has failed to get medical help for her child in order to protect a partner, sometimes with tragic results. It is also a finding made in cases where continuing to live with a person (often in a toxic atmosphere, frequently marked with domestic violence) is having a serious and obvious deleterious effect on the children in the household. The harm, emotional rather than physical, can be equally significant and damaging to a child.</span></p>

A finding of failing to protect can lead a Court to conclude that the children's best interests will not be served by remaining with, or returning to, the care of that parent, even though that parent may have been wholly exonerated from having caused any physical injuries.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.27in"><span style="font-family:Arial">Any Court conducting a Finding of Fact Hearing should be alert to the danger of such a serious finding becoming 'a bolt on' to the central issue of perpetration or of falling into the trap of assuming too easily that, if a person was living in the same household as the perpetrator, such a finding is almost inevitable. As Aikens LJ observed in Re J, "nearly all parents will be imperfect in some way or another". Many households operate under considerable stress and men go to prison for serious crimes, including crimes of violence, and are allowed to return home by their longsuffering partners upon their release. That does not mean that for that reason alone, that parent has failed to protect her children in allowing her errant partner home, unless, by reason of one of the facts connected with his offending, or some other relevant behaviour on his part, those children are put at risk of suffering significant harm. This professional and realistic approach allowed the Court to focus on what was, in reality, the only live issue, namely; was GL's history of violence sufficient to lead to a finding of failure to protect upon the mother's part?&#8221; Similar points were made in G-L-T (Children) [2019] EWCA Civ 717.</span></p>

That did not happen here &#8211; the mother was open with the father and nursery and did not seek to hide any injuries.

To cause the bruise there would also have needed to be a forceful grab or gripping of the arm or contact with a hard surface. Mother&#8217;s evidence was that she had not removed the arm herself, but that it was done by the intervenor and she did not fully see what he did as she was behind him. From the intervenor&#8217;s evidence it was clear was that he was very concerned at the position in which he found H in the bed, trapped, on the edge of tears and in pain and he freed him as soon as possible. He was unable to remember how he had achieved this and had mentioned &#8220;hindsight&#8221; when asked if he had been cautious not to rip H out and answered (approximately) that &#8220;I would like to think I was cautious but he was trapped&#8221; and added that they didn&#8217;t know how long he had been trapped. I interpret this as it being possible therefore that he was rougher than he recalled or would have usually been in view of the circumstances. If additional force was used than this would concur with Dr Cleghorn&#8217;s potential explanation of a forceful grab or grip when extracting him being a feasible explanation for the arm bruises.</span></p>
