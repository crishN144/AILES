The decision was made after a three day hearing in February 2024.  At the date of the judgment S was 9.5 years old.

The F applied for a CAO in December 2015. There has been litigation concerning S ever since, so for the large majority of his life. In May 2016 it was ordered that S live with the M but spend time with the F. In January 2017 the F applied again for S to live with him. This was concluded with an order that S continue to live with the M but spend alternate weekends with the F.</p>

The mother was not excluding the father from important decisions in relation to [S&#8217;s] education and health. The mother was not wrongly refusing to mediate.

This was inter alia on the basis that the M had prevented all contact since February 2020. There had been a period between 2018 and early 2020 when S had been having contact with the F, Dr K and her daughter, and this contact appeared to have gone relatively smoothly and the evidence suggests that S had enjoyed it.  The background to the cessation of contact was that on 29 January 2020 M told the school that S had alleged physical abuse by the F. There was a safeguarding referral and the Local Authority (&#8220;LA&#8221;) advised the M to suspend contact. Shortly thereafter the LA informed the M that there was no reason why contact should not resume subject to S&#8217;s wishes and feelings. However, contact did not resume. </p>

She raised concerns about &#8220;parental alienation&#8221; largely by the M but also some negative behaviour by the F. The Judge refers at paragraph 14-17 (J14-J17) to this report in some detail. Ms W recommended a psychological assessment of the family and that a Guardian be appointed. The Judge noted that in that report Ms W refers to the fact that a change of residence without work to support him would be &#8220;incredibly harmful&#8221; and &#8220;frightening&#8221; to S. </p>

Dr Arora considered that both parents had minimal insight into the concerns that had been identified. There was no ability between them to work collaboratively with each other because their interpersonal difficulties remained unresolved and that no steps had been taken, despite recommendations being made as far back as 2017, to address those concerns. It was also evident that both parents have a high degree of impression management. It was observed that they seek to be accepted to be doing the right thing.</span></p>

That was also observed by Ms Fitzsimmons and Ms W. Dr Arora concluded in her clinical view a change of carer would not be in [S&#8217;s] best interest, not would it be proportionate or necessary. She considered such a change in the absence of a robust specialist support would cause [S] emotional trauma. In an addendum report, dated 3rd February 2023, Dr Arora clarified that is therapeutic support or intervention was not followed through it would mean that the situation was unlikely to improve and therefore [S] would be unlikely to benefit from a relationship with his father. Dr Arora clarified there would be no alternative that could be recommended.&#8221;</span></p>

This report is central to much of Mr Sampson&#8217;s criticism of the Judgment and I make extensive reference to it below. Her recommendation was that a change of residence &#8220;should happen as soon as possible&#8221; and there should be a break of any contact between S and his mother for 3-4 months, see paragraphs 48-49 of her report. Her report is a fairly lengthy one which sets out the pros and cons of different options, with full reasoning. I intend no disservice to that report by not quoting it further here. It is clear from the report as a whole and the section headed &#8220;[the M]&#8221; in particular, that Ms W took the view the M was effectively incapable of promoting contact, was engaging in false compliance and was negative and unhelpful in supporting contact between S and his father (see para 36). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The judgment is 155 paragraphs long and has an additional 11 paragraphs after &#8220;clarification&#8221; requests by the parties. Self-evidently the judgment must be considered as a whole and I will only set out a summary and extracts. This is important because in my view Mr Sampson makes many criticisms of the judgment which do not stand up to scrutiny if it is read fairly and as a whole. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This was principally a finding of fact hearing. The Judge&#8217;s welfare decisions (particularly in relation to the transfer of residence application) necessarily followed his findings. Mr Sampson made some submissions about the nature of the hearing not being clear. But this was a case where the Judge considered the evidence, came to conclusions on the &#8220;facts&#8221; (in truth many of the findings were judgements of the parties rather than in any true sense facts), and then made decisions about S&#8217;s best interests going forward. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view there are some key points which emerge from the judgment. Firstly, the Judge did not consider that the F had moved on very much from his presentation before DJ Dodds, see J58, J59 and J151. He continued to have a lack of insight into DJ Dodds&#8217; findings, J67. In the section dealing with the F&#8217;s evidence the Judge said:</p>

In my opinion it pervades his actions and response to any event. The first thought he has is to blame the mother, regardless of whether there is justification in that. The father stated that mother needed psychiatric assessment to the school. At times those actions in response would have caused anxiety and stress, quite likely transmitted to [S].&#8221;</span></p>

The primary function of a first instance judge is to find facts and identify the crucial legal points and to advance reasons for deciding them in a particular way. He should give his reasons in sufficient detail to show the parties and, if need be, the Court of Appeal the principles on which he has acted and the reasons that have led him to his decision. They need not be elaborate. There is no duty on a judge, in giving his reasons, to deal with every argument presented by counsel in support of his case. His function is to reach conclusions and give reasons to support his view, not to spell out every matter as if summing up to a jury. Nor need he deal at any length with matters that are not disputed. It is sufficient if what he says shows the basis on which he has acted. These are not controversial observations: see Customs and Excise Commissioners v A [2022] EWCA Civ 1039 [2003] Fam 55 ; Bekoe v Broomes [2005] UKPC 39 ; Argos Ltd v Office of Fair Trading [2006] EWCA Civ 1318; [2006] UKCLR 1135 ."</span></p>

The findings cannot stand, not because they are necessarily wrong, but because of the way the judge arrived at her conclusion. As in Re O, there are three overlapping problems with the judgment. First, the reasoning is, in a number of respects, insufficient and flawed. Secondly, in reaching her ultimate conclusion, the judge failed to take into account some material factors. Thirdly, she looked at the evidence in compartments and did not have regard to each piece of evidence in the context of the totality of the evidence before making her findings.</span></p>

An appellate court must not interfere with findings of fact by trial judges, including the evaluation of those facts and to inferences to be drawn from them, unless compelled to do so. An appeal court is bound, unless there is compelling reason to the contrary, to assume that the trial judge has taken the whole of the evidence into his consideration. The mere fact that a judge does not mention a specific piece of evidence does not mean that he overlooked it. This approach is followed by this Court hearing family appeals just as it is in other appeals in civil cases. Those passages from Fage and Volpi have been cited and applied in this Court hearing appeals in family proceedings on many occasions, most recently in Re T (Fact-Finding: Second Appeal) [2023] EWCA Civ 475 when allowing a second appeal after the first appellate judge had failed to follow that approach when setting aside findings made by the trial judge.&#8221;</span></p>

In conducting that review, an appellate court will have clearly in mind the advantages that the judge has over any subsequent court - see Lord Wilson in In re B at para 41 and the earlier decision of the House of Lords in Piglowska v Piglowski [1999] UKHL 27; [1999] 1 WLR 1360. 50. In In re B Lord Neuberger, at para 93, essayed a further dissection of the process of deciding whether a judge&#8217;s decision was wrong. He cautiously prefaced his suggested breakdown of the possible states of mind of an appellate judge with the observation that there was danger in over-analysis. With hindsight, that was a prophetic observation, as this court held in the subsequent case of R (R) v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police [2018] UKSC 47; [2018] 1 WLR 4079.

The passage risks adding an unnecessary layer of complication.

The question is rather concerned with the adequacy of the judge&#8217;s process of reasoning in reaching his conclusion. This appeal asks the question whether the judge did go through the rigorous process described at para 47 above or whether he proceeded too directly from his finding that the threshold criteria were met to the conclusion that it followed that a care order ought to be made. If, on appeal, it is found that a judge has unduly telescoped the process, and has not made the side-by-side analysis of the pros and cons of each alternative to a care order, then the likely conclusion is that his decision is, for that reason, flawed and ought to be set aside.&#8221;</span></p>

The task facing a judge is not to pass an examination, or to prepare a detailed legal or factual analysis of all the evidence and submissions he has heard. Essentially, the judicial task is twofold: to enable the parties to understand why they have won or lost; and provide sufficient detail and analysis to enable to decide whether or not the judgment is sustainable. The judge need not slavishly restate either the facts, the arguments or the law. To adopt the striking metaphor of Mostyn J in SP v EB and KP [2014] EWHC 3964 (Fam), [2016] 1 FLR 229, para 29, there is no need for the judge to &#8220;incant mechanically&#8221; passages from the authorities, the evidence or the submissions, as if he were &#8220;a pilot going through the pre-flight checklist&#8221;.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view &#8220;parental alienation&#8221; is not a helpful categorisation. There may be multiple reasons why a child is suspicious of, or hostile to, one parent. There is a spectrum between a child&#8217;s wholly justified concerns and the parent who deliberately seeks to turn a child against the other parent out of hostility, which is not objectively justified, to that other parent.  One parent may play a role in the child&#8217;s view of the other parent, indeed if the child lives with one parent that is highly likely to be the case. There may be some objective reason for the lived with parent&#8217;s view, as was the case here in the light of DJ Dodds&#8217; judgment. That the child picks up and responds to the lived with parent&#8217;s views, worries, suspicions and concerns, is very likely. There will then be a spectrum of both the lived with parent&#8217;s worries and the degree to which the child reflects them or magnifies them. Some parents may be very good at hiding those worries, some much less so. But to be labelling this &#8220;parental alienation&#8221; seems to me to be unhelpful. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A child may become worried and perhaps scared of an absent parent for all sorts of reasons. That fear may not be objectively justified, but being scared of something or someone is often not an objectively justified response, whether by an adult or a child. The lack of objective justification for one&#8217;s fears makes them no less real.  There appears to be in the case something of an assumption by the F and the Guardian that if the child is scared of the F that must be because he has been &#8220;alienated&#8221; and that his fear is somehow illegitimate and can be largely ignored, with the justification of creating a relationship with his father.  In my view this is both illogical and does not follow the basic human psychology. S&#8217;s fear of his father may be wholly real and impactful upon him, even if it has no rational basis. Given that the Court has a statutory duty to pursue the child&#8217;s welfare, forcing him to live with a parent he is afraid of, whether objectively justified or not, is something that would need considerable justification. </p>

In formulating this opinion I take into account that there are some children who manage a change of residence well and there are some who do not. It is not possible to predict the future but in my opinion [S] will undoubtedly struggle initially however there have been glimmers of hope in [S&#8217;s] response to his paternal family members which show that when [S] is away from scrutiny and parental influence, he is able to settle and even be positive within these relationships.</span></p>

This subsequently led to the GP making a referral to Children&#8217;s Services. I reflect on Dr Arora&#8217;s report where she states &#8220;[S&#8217;s] score on the anxiety scale is mildly elevated. This suggests that he is likely to have psychological vulnerabilities associated with anxiety. Thus, he may benefit from a clinical intervention to address anxiety related concerns.&#8221; Dr Arora goes on to state felt that [S&#8217;s] anxiety was likely to be a result of the lifetime parental conflict he has experienced. I was deeply troubled to read the school log dated the 19/10/23 where [the M] reportedly stated that [S] is scared in respect of contact, however that he has to go because she doesn&#8217;t want him to be removed from her care, having to move school and stop going to basketball due to living with his father so is doing &#8216;what she is told&#8217;. [The M] has previously told me that she has told [S] that he has to go. In my experience of discussing contact with [the M] she presents as anxious and unsupportive, so this combined with a narrative that he &#8216;has to&#8217; go to contact, in my opinion does not give [S] the emotional permission or reassurance that she believes this is what is best for him and that the relationship with his father is important. Dr Arora highlighted that when she met [S] and [the M], she observed him to look at [the M] for reassurance, so in my view [S] would have needed both verbal and nonverbal reassurance from [the M], which do not think she has been able to give.&#8221;</span></p>

This was par excellence a judgement for him having heard the oral evidence. Fundamentally the F and the Guardian disagree, but that is not a matter for an appeal court.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.17in;margin-right:0.59in">He placed very considerable weight on the impact on S from being moved, including on his schooling, his friendships and his relationships, and on the risk of self-harm and behavioural problems see J140-J143. Again this is a matter of weight for the Judge. Mr Sampson has tried to elevate some of the dicta in the cases on parental alienation to somehow being binding propositions of law. That cannot be right for the reasons given by the President of the Family Division in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re C</span>, the court needs to focus on the particular behaviour of the parents and the particular impact on the child. There may be cases where a &#8220;robust&#8221; intervention has a good prospect of restoring relationships and the harm to the child can be seen to be &#8220;short-term&#8221;. There may be other cases where such an intervention is not proportionate, given the harm involved. Where on that spectrum or balance a case lies depends on the individual facts, and subject to the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Volpi</span> test of it being one that no reasonable judge could have reached, is for the trial judge. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.17in;margin-right:0.59in">He considered the benefits to S of rebuilding the relationship with his father, but in my view entirely rightly said there was no guarantee of success, see J145. He was plainly worried about the lack of confidence in the strategy, see J147-J150. I asked in the hearing whether there was any peer reviewed research as to whether the kind of intervention proposed here was likely to be successful. I note that neither I nor the Judge were pointed to any such research. The weight that the Judge attached to the risk of the proposed move of residence being unsuccessful in terms of restoring the relationship, but causing S very considerable and unquantifiable harm, was again a matter for the Judge. It is worth noting at this point that Dr Arora was sufficiently concerned about S and potential for self-harm, that she said in oral evidence if residence was transferred he would have to be supervised at all times. This is merely a small indication of the level of risk that the Judge was being asked to take. </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I have to express a degree of scepticism. I appreciate that the guardian and others have formed a view that the father has moved on since District Judge Dodds&#8217; findings. My own assessment is that it is not particularly far forward. The father has not made contact with [S&#8217;s] school, as reported by the guardian and when he did it resulted in a negative commentary towards the mother. There has been repeated applications, demonstrating a fixed approach in achieving an outcome the father has sought since the beginning. I do temper that with the evidence that was given before me, which seems to demonstrate some further movement forward.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ground Two focuses on the welfare analysis. The Judge took into account all the material evidence, weighed it up and reached a rational conclusion open to him. This Ground is in my view simply a challenge to the weight the Judge gave to different factors. Subject to rationality, weight is a matter for the Judge. The Judge gave more weight to the harm to S of removing him from his mother than to the potential benefits of the move in terms of restoring a relationship with the F. It might be said that the Judge gave more weight to short-term harm than possible medium and long-term benefit, but that was a matter for him.  The F strongly disagrees with that balance, but there is nothing &#8220;wrong&#8221; or irrational about it. </p>

This was a highly material consideration for the Judge, given that it formed an important part of the history and DJ Dodds had set out clear views on the parties. The Judge was entitled not just to take it into account, but also to assess how far he felt that the F had changed since he gave evidence in 2018. The Judge&#8217;s assessment was self-evidently open to him, given that he heard the oral evidence. Again the Judge disagreed with the Guardian, but that was a matter for him. His reasons are again perfectly clear. </p>
