In relation to children, it was perhaps most eloquently and most memorably expressed as &#8220;there can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children&#8221; (Nelson Mandela, 8 May 1995).   </p>

The local authority, Lancashire County Council, has made two applications with respect to G.  On 28 August 2020 the local authority applied for an order under the inherent jurisdiction authorising the deprivation of G&#8217;s liberty.  On 7 October 2020, the local authority applied for a secure accommodation order pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

As of this morning, no such placement is available for G anywhere in the United Kingdom.  In the alternative, the local authority seek to place G in a regulated non-secure placement under the auspices of an order authorising the deprivation of her liberty.  Once again, as of this morning, no such placement is available for G anywhere in the United Kingdom. As I have stated, there is no CAMHS psychiatric bed available for her and, in any event, the court has been this morning provided with a report from G&#8217;s treating clinicians confirming that G does not meet the criteria for continued detention under the mental health legislation.  </p>

By reason of the fact that this placement was only identified very shortly before this hearing, the precise reasons for this are unclear, as is the manner that the placement will seek to apply the regulatory framework applicable to secure accommodation orders, as the authorities make clear it must, should the court authorise the deprivation of G&#8217;s liberty.  Within this context, the local authority finds itself compelled to advance this placement as being the only option available to safeguard G&#8217;s welfare.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian is unable to give her support to G being placed in this placement under the auspices of an order depriving G of her liberty, albeit that she recognises that this is, in reality, the only option currently available for G. </p>

Upon discharge, G was placed in a residential placement.  In this placement she was violent and aggressive to staff members and caused damage to property.  As at 17 August 2020 G had written nine letters stating she wanted to kill herself.   The Mental Health Team attended the placement and tried to assess G but she would not engage.  The assessment of the Mental Health Team was that G did not meet the criteria for a Tier Four bed and considered that the last two admissions had not been productive for G. On 17 August 2020, after the Mental Health Team had left, G assaulted staff, damaged property and ran from the placement threatening to kill herself.  </p>

In the evening on 25 August 2020 G tied a long sock around her neck which, again, had to be cut from her neck. G stated she would run away from the home in order to kill herself.  As I have noted, on 28 August 2020 the local authority applied for an order under the inherent jurisdiction authorising the deprivation of G&#8217;s liberty and authorisation for the deprivation of G&#8217;s liberty was granted by HHJ Bancroft on 28 August 2020. </p>

In that placement G continued to display high risk behaviours in the form of self-harm including self-strangulation, cutting and swallowing objects.

The matter came before Her Honour Judge Bancroft on 8 October 2020. As of 8 October 2020, the local authority had been unable to identify a secure placement.  In the circumstances, the court granted a further deprivation of liberty order until 5 November 2020, for G&#8217;s then placement, Y. The local authority confirmed that the placement at Y was intended to be an interim placement until a suitable longer-term placement is identified.  At the time of the hearing on 8 October 2020, G remained in police custody and Y had agreed to the placement of G to return to placement upon her release from police custody whilst a search for a longer-term placement continued. </p>

G has continued to display extreme behaviours whilst on the ward and has spent some time in exclusion. G began to ligature in exclusion and not attempt to self-rescue.

G has also set fire to her room on the ward.

Within an inpatient setting she has assaulted staff, targeted vulnerable patients, damaged the ward environment, graffitied racist and homophobic language onto her walls.

As part of this process change it was jointly agreed that it was not felt necessary that the SCH&#8217;s were named moving forward.

This may well make things easier for SWCU.  The same cannot be said for the vulnerable children that local authorities, and in some cases the court, are charged with protecting.  In particular, it not clear how SWCU&#8217;s stated aim, as articulated in Ms Gunniss&#8217; letter, to &#8220;streamline the process of finding the most suitable placement matching the individual needs of each young person needing secure care&#8221; and to enable &#8220;informed decisions about the most appropriate placement for them&#8221; is facilitated by not providing the names and locations of the secure units in question to the local authorities that, as Ms Gunniss is at such pains to point out, have responsibility for identifying the appropriate placement for an individual child. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">During the course of submissions I raised with counsel whether the foregoing observation by Baker LJ in Re B (Secure Accommodation) might prevent the court in this case from exercising the inherent jurisdiction in circumstances where all parties are agreed that the criteria for a secure accommodation order are made out (albeit the Children&#8217;s Guardian considers that such an outcome would not be optimum having regard to G&#8217;s welfare needs).  On further reflection, I am satisfied it does not because, in fact, not all of the criteria required for making a secure accommodation order are made out in this case.  Re B makes clear that one of the pre-conditions to the making of a secure accommodation is that the placement proposed is &#8220;secure accommodation&#8221; as defined in Re B (namely, it is designed for or having as its primary purpose the restriction of liberty). In this case such a placement is not available and I am satisfied that the inherent jurisdiction therefore remains available to the court because all of the criteria under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.25</ref> are not met, and indeed cannot be met.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is plain that, despite the issue being highlighted in multiple court decisions since 2017, and by the Children&#8217;s Commissioner, the shortage of clinical provision for placement of children and adolescents requiring assessment and treatment for mental health issues within a restrictive clinical environment, the shortage of secure placements and the shortage of regulated placements remains.  In this context, children like G with highly complex needs and behaviour continue to fall through the gaps that exist between secure accommodation, regulated accommodation and detention under the mental health legislation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Besides the obvious prejudice to the welfare of highly vulnerable children that this situation creates, leaving society&#8217;s most vulnerable children without the help they need to address their complex emotional and mental health issues, the situation also has a highly corrosive on the decision making process of local authorities and courts that is designed to assure the welfare of those children.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In particular, the shortage of appropriate resources increases the risk that the decisions regarding the welfare of children will be driven primarily by expediency,  with the welfare principle relegated to a poor second place.  Within the context of secure accommodation, the local authority and the court must each consider whether the proposed placement would safeguard and promote the child's welfare (see Re B (Secure Accommodation Order) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2019/2025" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCA Civ 2025" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCA Civ 2025</ref>).  When considering whether to grant an order authorising the deprivation of a child&#8217;s liberty the court must treat the child&#8217;s best interests as its paramount consideration.  Where a local authority or a court is placed in a position of having to approve a placement because it is the only option available it is obvious that these cardinal principles will be at risk of being undermined.  Yet this is the situation that local authorities and courts are forced to grapple with everyday up and down the country by the continuing shortage of appropriate resources and as highlighted repeatedly in the authorities that I have referred to above and more widely by the Children&#8217;s Commissioner for England.   </p>

Whilst basing the court&#8217;s decision as to best interests on this narrow consideration in circumstances where the placement identified is otherwise sub-optimal in terms of G&#8217;s wider welfare risks reducing the application of the best interests test to an almost transactional exercise, it cannot be in G&#8217;s best interests to be discharged into the community where she will, I am satisfied on the evidence before the court, be at a very high risk of fatal self-harm.   </p>

In particular, I bear in mind that whilst, for reasons that are plainly justified, the Children&#8217;s Guardian cannot support the course of action proposed by the local authority, the Children&#8217;s Guardian also, through Mr Jones, realistically recognises the reality of the situation.  Namely, there is nowhere else for G to go upon her discharge from the adult mental health ward and it is not in her best interests to be discharged into the community with the concomitant high risk of harm and death. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I have also borne carefully in mind that, as matters stand at the hearing today, the placement identified by the local authority has stated an intention not to seek registration and that, accordingly, this is not a case in which the President&#8217;s guidance Practice Guidance: Placements in unregistered children&#8217;s homes in England or unregistered care home services in Wales can readily be complied with.  It is clear from the terms of the guidance that that guidance does not exclude the possibility of it being in a child&#8217;s best interests to be deprived of their liberty in an unregulated placement. However, in this case the fact that the placement was identified only just prior to this hearing and the fact that court has already been notified that the placement in question does not intend to seek registration must mean that the court can only authorise the placement for the shortest possible time before undertaking a review.  That review will be undertaken having directed the local authority to file and serve a statement setting out (a) the reasons for the placement deciding not to seek registration, (b) the steps it being taken by the local authority to ensure that the premises and support being provided are safe and suitable for the child accommodated and (c) the steps the local authority is taking to assure itself that the premises, those working at the premises and the care being given are safe and suitable for the accommodated child.  I also bear in mind that the local authority intend over this weekend to put in place twenty four hour support from COVE in respect of G&#8217;s mental health. </p>

Within this context, I am left asking myself whether, where there is only one, sub-optimal option open to the court apart from allowing G back into the community where she may well end her own life, the court is really exercising its welfare jurisdiction if it chooses that one option, or if it is simply being forced by mere circumstance to make an order irrespective of welfare considerations. At best, the decision can be based on only the narrowest of such considerations, namely the bare need to prevent G from harming herself.  Within this context, I echo the words of the former President in Re X (A Child)(No.3) as I am left acutely conscious of my powerlessness, of my inability to do more for G. </p>
