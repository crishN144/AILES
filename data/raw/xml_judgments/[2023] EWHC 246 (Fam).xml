His case is that Mother either wrongfully removed - in the sense that her actions were premeditated and involved her obtaining his consent to a holiday which was a pretence for a removal  - the children to England; or wrongfully retained the children  here, the Father having consented  to a holiday between 4-20 March 2022. </p>

So it is that if it is determined to be a wrongful retention, the Father says that the children were wrongfully retained as of 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2022 on which date the Mother issued applications in this jurisdiction for Child arrangements orders; prohibited steps orders and specific issue orders.  Her applications came before the Family court in Medway on 21 March 2022. Those proceedings have been stayed.&#160;The Mother, who was represented by her present solicitors but with different counsel, asserted in the application placed before the District Judge at Medway that whilst the Father is habitually resident in Texas she and the Children were habitually resident here. That was not so and should not have been said to be so.</p>

Mother also concedes that the children have been wrongfully retained by her in this jurisdiction.

At the first hearing before Holman J a report was directed to be prepared by CAFCASS High Court Team together with a psychological report upon Mother, and a report from an expert in Texan law. Both parties were given permission to file evidence in support of their respective cases. Consequent upon that direction there are very lengthy statements of evidence from the parties and it is perhaps no surprise that by the time of the PTR before Moor J on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October this hearing was structured such that oral evidence would be given by the professional witnesses only.&#160;</p>

It is accordingly incumbent upon me to consider participation directions so as to enable her to participate in the hearing. Arrangements had been made for the Mother to sit screened from sight of the Father (the special measure requested on her behalf). Before the hearing started discussions between the Mother and her counsel resulted in a position whereby the Mother sat behind her counsel at the far end of the court from the Father but nevertheless without a curtain or screen. This being a departure from what had been sought I raised the issue with Ms Papazian who was explicit that this was now the Mother&#8217;s preference but that the Mother&#8217;s legal team would keep the matter under review and ask for a different arrangement if needed.  So far as I was able to tell during the hearing, from observing the Mother engaging with her solicitor, seeing her listening to the evidence, writing notes to her counsel and giving instructions, it was unnecessary for me to interfere with the approach taken about her participation.</p>

The application was made very late &#8211; so late in fact that had the evidential timetable been observed evidence would already have been part way through. The letter had been obtained by the Mother herself and not on the advice or on the instigation of her counsel or solicitor. Ms Ramsahoye unsurprisingly objected to its admission into evidence making the strong point that it should not have been obtained in circumstances where there was already properly directed part 25 compliant evidence in relation to Mothers mental health and that as recently as the PTR no mention of, still less application for it had been made. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">The immediate background to this litigation appears above. The wider background need be set out in outline only. The parties who are both British nationals met in about 2005 or 2006 through their mutual involvement in a new Christian church . They married whilst on holiday in Sweden on 28th March 2008. The children of the family were both born in England.  In 2014 the parties  moved to Texas.   The specific reason for the move is a matter of dispute between the parties  but not one which it is necessary for me to consider far less to determine at this summary return hearing, given the parties&#8217; position on Habitual Residence,  but there is something approaching common ground that the move was for work reasons for the Father (though both parties worked once in Texas) and for what the Father says were better family prospects.</p>

As a consequence of this, the Father issued divorce proceedings in Texas. There were discussions between the parties, and they agreed that the Father would stop the divorce proceedings on the basis that they would try counselling and mediation.  Those proceeding remain, as I am told at this hearing, live in Texas in the light of the developments in the parties' lives and the obvious failure of counselling and mediation as a route through their difficulties.</p>

Those suicidal or self-harming behaviours appear to have been within the context of being unhappy at living in America and wishing to return to England. She has at various times been medicated and I have been told at this hearing was referred for CBT following the second suicide attempt.  There is evidence including that within her medical records on the basis of which the jointly instructed expert in these proceedings offered a tentative diagnosis of personality disorder. He has, in the lifetime of these proceedings become rather firmer in that view.</p>

Thus, at para 34, it recorded, with approval, a concession by Mr Turner QC, who was counsel for the Father in that case, that, if there was a grave risk that the child would be placed in an intolerable situation, &#8220;the source of it is irrelevant: eg, where a Mother's subjective perception of events lead to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child&#8221;. Furthermore, when, at para 49, the court turned its attention to the facts of that case, it said that it found <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">&#8220;no reason to doubt that the risk to the Mother's mental health, whether it be the result of objective reality or of the Mother's subjective perception of reality, or a combination of the two, is very real</span>&#8221;.</p>

It is not my intention to set out all of that which I have heard and read.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">Mr Vaught, is a Board-Certified Family Law expert practising from a specialist Family law firm in Texas.  Although selected for his expertise in the area by Mother&#8217;s legal team and agreed by Father&#8217;s, he may with the benefit of hindsight have not had the breadth of experience of advising in Hague cases as had been anticipated. He had provided answers in three tranches to questions raised of him. those answers appear in documents dated June 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>  and October 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>.  My impression from listening to his evidence is that his focus on the questions asked &#8211; and perhaps more focussed questions- developed over the course of his instruction. In submissions Ms Ramsahoye  suggested that Mr Vaught had led himself into error by turning his mind to the domestic law of Texas rather than looking at the construction of article 3 in Hague terms. Mr Vaught did not address the question of &#8216;home state jurisdiction&#8217; although he may have been unaware from his instructions that Mother had conceded a wrongful retention from the home state and that the children remain habitually resident in the state of Texas.&#160; </p>

It is regrettable that his wide experience of Family Law in the courts of Texas had not included international (with the exception of some arising from the proximity of the Mexican border) or Hague cases at all. Regrettable also that whilst he had experience of perhaps 8 -10 relocation cases those had been all either within the state of Texas or interstate.  Thanks to Ms Papazian&#8217;s dogged persistence in exploring with him the Mother&#8217;s article 20 case I was able ultimately to understand what it was he said about it, though I did not ultimately accept all of that which he expressed orally on the point. </p>

She had not, within the report filed, advised specifically on whether the children had objections and if so what they were to a return to the State of Texas. In her oral evidence she told me that she had been preparing reports for some years now pursuant to similarly couched directions but that it was her habit to regard the question of a child&#8217;s objection as a matter for the court notwithstanding and so she did not ever refer to it directly. There was, as Ms Julian put it <span style="font-style:italic">nothing negative about Texas </span>said by either of them to her.

He told Ms Julian that his Mother &#160;<span style="font-style:italic">hates liars and Emily can be a bit of a liar as she&#8217;s autistic&#8230; and Emily was beginning to get afraid of mum because of the shouting.&#8221;</span></p>

I did not have evidence which suggest that this is deliberate still less by coaching but they were plainly aware that they were being asked their views for a purpose and plainly aware of what their Mother would want to happen. Ms Papazian also made the strong point to Ms Julian in cross examination that there is no indication from the way in which the children speak of their Father that they have been as it were &#8216;turned against him&#8217;. She is right about that they speak with love and fondness of him and say in terms they miss him. Adam made reference to England being his real home and of familiar sights. That cannot be his own experience and perception since for most of his life he has lived in America.  What he said to Ms Julian was consistent with understanding the trip as a holiday <span style="font-style:italic">Emily and I just thought we were staying for a week or two. Mum didn&#8217;t want us knowing. </span> There is no suggestion that the children were aware that the family dog would be travelling to join them although plans for that must self-evidently have been made in advance by the Mother.</p>

Those were recordings made covertly by the Father of the Mother behaving appallingly towards Emily in the presence of both children and on occasion of the Father recording himself having what I would characterise as self-serving conversations with the children about their Mother.  In the body of her report Ms Julian had described the recordings as <span style="font-style:italic">difficult to hear </span>by which she explained from the witness box she meant hard to listen to. They were, she told me very concerning. I agree and share her concern. They are concerning first for the clear demonstration of what the children were experiencing from their Mother (as no doubt the Father intended in seeking leave to adduce them) and for the fact that the Father stood by covertly recording and evidence gathering rather than taking steps to protect the children from it (the significance of which appears to have escaped him when seeking leave to adduce them). The Mother and the Father in their arguments before me have sought to say that the recordings are evidence of poor and non-child focussed behaviour by the other. In a sense they are both right.   It so happens that the recordings are produced to me within the context of a return application. Had they been produced in the context of a private law dispute between these parents the evidence they give me of the parenting decisions made by<span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"> each</span> parent would have led me to refer the matter to the relevant social services. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">Dr Farhy is a consultant psychologist. Both his written and his oral evidence brought into sharp focus the issue of the defence raised by the Mother under Article 13 (b) harm and intolerability. There is no suggestion in this case that the intolerability is by reason of any direct effect on either of the children. It relates solely to the question of the effect on the Mother because of her mental health and the knock-on effect on the children. As emerges from the consideration of relevant and applicable legal principles earlier that is sufficient and has been accepted as so in principle by counsel before me &#8211; the debate is not about the principle but as to the fact specific situation here.  It is the Mother&#8217;s case that she is and has always been their primary carer. I do not see in the evidence that the Father in so many words concedes that but what is notable in the way that the arguments have been advanced before me is that no one has advanced a case that were it intolerable for the Mother to return to Texas with the children should I  direct a summary return, then they should go with their Father and live with him pending resolution of their longer term living arrangements. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">There is of course a live issue between the parents as to whether, as the Mother alleges, the Father has been domestically abusive and coercively controlling of the Mother. If it is necessary for that to be the subject of a fact finding hearing so as to make decisions for the children it will be for  a court determining the facts which I am not. Of relevance for me at this hearing however is Dr Farhy&#8217;s expressed view of the Mother that <span style="font-style:italic">The vulnerabilities are there but it is unclear whether these are impacted by the behaviours on his part that she described or whether these do not occur and her distress and malfunction is wholly or mainly self-induced</span>. I understand that to mean that within the context of this summary return application, the Mother&#8217;s psychological profile is one which falls to be considered regardless of any disputed facts. In his oral evidence Dr Fahy when being asked about the adequacy or otherwise of the protective measures expanded on this saying that because of the Mother&#8217;s mental health difficulties it might be that however adequate the protections might be from an objective perspective there may be no meaningful effect for the Mother because of her own subjective view and fear. <span style="font-style:italic">It may be </span>he said to me<span style="font-style:italic"> that the stressors are not unusual but she perceives them as so. She is</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">someone who does not just see in black and white but its black or brilliant white so if something isn&#8217;t brilliant white but something less than that then its black. So it is because of who she is and not what the stressors are that there&#8217;s the chance that she will react badly on return. So even where there is a proposed measure that is objectively sound the Mother&#8217;s subjective response is important and the impact on her mental health. Sometimes the demands are impossible to meet &#8230; the experience is genuine but cannot be assuaged by any attempt of the other party and so that makes it impossible to meet it. </span> What he had described as the chance of her reacting badly was not something he was able to quantify but his evidence was that it was real and heightened by her mental health profile.</p>

There are a number of aspects which make me suspect that it was so. Prominently amongst them are the arrangements to transport the family dog; the sale before leaving on holiday of the Mother&#8217;s car; the near immediate application to the Medway family court and the attempt to mislead the District Judge at that court as to the habitual residence situation &#8211; which can only have been on instructions since the Mother was represented and clear assertion made on the application. On a narrow balance however and reminding myself that suspicion must be kept in its proper place, I have stepped away from determining that this was wrongful removal.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">Ms Papzian raises as a defence that were I to direct a summary return to Texas there would there be no jurisdiction by which she could make an application for permission to relocate with the children to England. That aspect of her defence was heralded before Holman J and led to his directions for the instruction of the agreed expert Mr Vaught.  Whilst Mr Vaught&#8217;s written evidence came in a way that involved answering supplemental and addendum questions so as to clarify opinion already given, the end point of that process in his 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2022 response  in answer to the question <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;what application does a parent need to make to secure an Order allowing them permission to permanently relocate outside of the United States with their children?&#8217; </span>was as follows : </p>

The submission takes strength from the fact that in the next passage of his response, Mr Vaught goes on to detail the factors statutory and otherwise which would be taken into account in determining whether the application to relocate should be granted or refused. Those factors have a ring of familiarity to those bringing or considering like applications in this jurisdiction. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">Ms Papazian cross examined Mr Vaught as to whether given the Mother&#8217;s acceptance of a wrongful retention, and for that matter the Father&#8217;s assertion that the reality is a wrongful removal, a past abduction would have an adverse effect on the likely outcome of her application to relocate. He said he thought it probably would. It was not clear on what he based that view.  Ms Papazian developed her submissions orally on the basis of this answer to submit that I should regard the prospect of the Mother being able to succeed on a relocation application as being so damaged by there having been an abduction that I should treat the avenue as in effect not open to her. That was a bold submission. Bold and unattractive. The logical end point of it, as I debated with Ms Papzian, is that a court may be faced with an abducting parent who says in effect on the article 20 point <span style="font-style:italic"> I have by my own bad behaviour in abducting the child damaged my prospects of being permitted to remove him by the lawful course so I should be allowed to have the benefit of being able to say that course is not open to me. </span>  I should not have been attracted to a submission which has its roots in that logic, but in the circumstances of this case I prefer and accept in any event the submission of Ms Ramsahoye that such evidence as there is before me is that there is a relocation jurisdiction available and the Mother has not made out her Article 20 defence. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">The  Mother defends the proceedings on the basis also that the children and each of them object  to a return within the meaning of Article 13 (2). To succeed on this defence the Mother must satisfy the court that the children object to returning to Texas; and&#160;that Emily and Adam have reached an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of their views.&#160; I have considered already in detail the evidence from Ms Julian as to the children&#8217;s articulated views. I accept her own assessment that they are mature children whose views it is appropriate for me to take into account. Both counsel have approached the case on the basis that the children should be treated as a sibling group of two and that it was not appropriate to advance any argument which suggested differing outcomes for them. I agree that they are right to do so. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">Whilst  Ms Julian&#8217;s approach to the direction to report on what if any objection the children had to a return  is a slightly curious approach to take in one sense, it so happens that in this case that, even where she has not commented on it, I can be quite clear that there was not within the views reported by Ms Julian  anything in the character of an  objection expressed by the children or either of them to a return to Texas. The closest in words was the reported overheard occasion on which Adam said he would <span style="font-style:italic">punch in the face</span> someone who said he was to return to Texas. Whilst Ms Papazian submits rhetorically what could that be but an objection, it is striking to me that it is without context or detail and also does not fit with that which comes out of the interview of Cafcass with him.  It is true also that there were raised by them societal issues which might not be ordinarily found at the forefront of the mind of children of 9 and 11 &#8211; the reversing of <span style="font-style:italic">Roe v Wade</span> in the case of Adam and the lack of firearms control in the case of Emily . I had wondered about the extent to which those issues were indicative of the influence of their Mother on the views they expressed. The picture was mixed in that Adam said in terms that what he knew about diminution of the rights of women in relation to abortion came from his Mother, whereas gun control is an issue of direct experience for children in American classrooms as they experience safety drills.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">I am quite satisfied on the evidence that defence which the Mother raises under 13 b that the children or either of them have an objection to returning is not one which she has established before me. Ms Papazian submits that there is taken in totality  a sense in which that which is gleaned from the children is to be taken as each of them is in fact objecting to a return because she says their views and  their own lived experiences of their Mother&#8217;s mental health issues in the past and their experiences of what is reported by them as her calmer presentation here is inextricably linked with the question of an objection and that they should be taken as having an objection to going back to the situation which would obtain in Texas. I do not accept that submission. Despite Counsel&#8217;s valiant efforts on this point I am not persuaded that there is objection or close to it. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">I have of course at this hearing been thinking about whether that which is reported by the children amounts to an objection within the meaning of Article 13(2) and not about what they say tells me of the experience they have had of living in the care of their parents and their longer-term welfare. I have confined myself to deciding whether there should be a return directed in a summary way and not strayed into other longer-term issues.  I observe however that some of what the children say is troubling and that even a cursory consideration of their wishes and feelings is sufficient to conclude that each would want to live without being shouted at and belittled and/or to be protected from that experience. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in"> As with other aspects of the applicable case law, there is no dispute as between counsel about the fact that where the facts of the case warrant it, the intolerability may flow from the effect on the returning parents&#8217; availability &#8211; including in the emotional and psychological sense &#8211; to the child. It is here the potential for mental collapse of the Mother which would lead to the intolerable situation for Emily and Adam. I have a real sense of unease within this, a summary jurisdiction at the prospect of an intolerability which stems entirely from the as yet unknown prospects of the effect on the parent who has retained the children. I bear in mind that many in her position faced with having to return would suffer, and be expected to suffer, a degree of stress and distress at being sent back. Not least because it is a situation brought upon themselves. Furthermore in this summary jurisdiction it should not be thought that simply by claiming that however adequate the protective measures in place the anxiety of the returning parent and the effect on their mental health is such that their ability to care for the child is at risk. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">In this case however and on the specific facts of this case I am driven to the conclusion that that is so. Ms Papazian is right that it is not in this case all unknown and speculative. There is a well-documented  history of serious mental health deficits in the Mother. Whilst Ms Ramsahoye makes the succinct and well-pitched submission that there have not been recent crises, there is however within that  well-documented history, evidence that previous crises were within the context of and associated with a strong wish to be (or not to be) in a particular country. There is no suggestion that the suicide attempts were trivial or did not require psychiatric inpatient treatment. There is no suggestion that the need to be available to care for her children was sufficient to prevent the Mother making those attempts.  The evidence that I have from the jointly instructed expert in relation to the Mother, her mental health and the likely impact of stressors as they are experienced by her on her functioning- and thus her functioning as their parent - is troubling.  He did not accept that there would be an immediate collapse in her mental health on return but he did accept that there would be a deterioration which whilst he would not quantify numerically was one which would affect her in a way that would not attach to her unaffected peers. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">The addendum report on the evidence from the covert recordings produced by the Father gives an additional insight into one of the ways in which deficits in the Mother&#8217;s parenting   of her children may manifest itself in response to her experiencing what she perceived as stress.  It is ultimately the consequences for her ability to parent the children with which I am concerned in evaluating the risk. In totality the evidence on this aspect and in the particular factual circumstances of this case is such that I am persuaded that the Mother has established the Defence under this head that a return would be intolerable for these children . In those circumstances  and I  exercise my discretion not to order their return. Whilst I agree with much of that which Ms Ramsahoye submits as to the excessive demands as to protective measures, the evidence of Dr Farhy as to protective measures which I accept means that it is unnecessary for me to consider the detail of Ms Papazian&#8217;s schedule of deficiencies and the extent to which they are objectively speaking reasonable or excessive</p>
