	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application by Essex County Council for a reporting restriction order in a matter which has been the subject of much reporting and comment in the media both in this country and around the world. Too much of that reporting has been inaccurate &#8211; though that, as I shall explain, is not entirely the fault of the media &#8211; and some of it has been tendentious, to use no stronger word. It is accordingly both necessary and desirable that I set out the background before turning to address the one application that is currently before me.</p>

Much of this has been strident and some of it has been inaccurate. The initial coverage on 1 and 2 December 2013 appeared under such headlines as &#8216;Operate on this mother so that we can take her baby&#8217;, &#8216;Woman&#8217;s baby taken from womb by social services&#8217; and &#8216;Social workers took baby into care after forcing her mother to have a Caesarean&#8217;. In fact, as we now know, the application to the Court of Protection was made by the relevant NHS Trust, not the local authority. In relation to all this there is interesting comment by various legal commentators on the blogosphere, including suggestions that some of the orders made might be vulnerable to legal challenge. Since these matters may yet require judicial determination I say nothing more.</p>

I forbear from extensive citation, merely repeating at this point, so as to emphasise, three key principles (<span style="font-style:italic">Re J</span>, paras 37-39). First, that &#8220;It is not the role of the judge to seek to exercise any kind of editorial control over the manner in which the media reports information which it is entitled to publish&#8221;. Second, that &#8220;Comment and criticism may be ill-informed and based, it may be, on misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the facts [but the] fear of such criticism, however justified that fear may be, and however unjustified the criticism, is &#8230; not of itself a justification for prior restraint by injunction of the kind being sought here, even if the criticism is expressed in vigorous, trenchant or outspoken terms &#8230; or even in language which is crude, insulting and vulgar&#8221;. Third, that &#8220;It is no part of the function of the court exercising the jurisdiction I am being asked to apply to prevent the dissemination of material because it is defamatory &#8230; If what is published is defamatory, the remedy is an action for defamation, not an application in the Family Division for an injunction.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;&#8230; the representative of Associated Newspapers has made clear to me &#8230; that Associated Newspapers have no intention of publicising the present whereabouts of the child, the people who are caring for the child or the identity of the child. That confirms my preliminary view that I have not been able to identify any public interest (as opposed to matters which might be of interest to the public) in identifying those matters. The reasons for that are that this child at present, pursuant to the relevant orders, is placed with a view to adoption. Stability of that placement if at the end of the day the child is adopted is of significant if not crucial importance for the short, medium and long term life of the child. Prospective adopters are going through an emotional experience and one where they are bonding to a child. If that is disrupted because of publicity with the result that the child is moved, that is likely, in my view, to cause short, medium and long term damage to the child. I have not been able, as I said during the hearing, to identify any argument which would indicate that the matters that are of significant public interest relating to the decision-making processes of both the Family Court and the Court of Protection in this matter, would be advanced one iota by identifying the present carers of the child, or the child. I therefore propose to grant an injunction as sought relating to the identification of the child or the persons caring for the child and the publication of any pictures of the child and/or those persons.&#8221;</p>

On the other hand, as Charles J pointed out, neither the compelling public interest in knowing about the case nor the mother&#8217;s compelling claim to be allowed to tell her story, would be advanced one iota by identifying P or her carers. I repeat what I said last week (<span style="font-style:italic">Re P </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/4037" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 4037 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 4037 (Fam)</ref>, para 3):</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That was as far as Charles J was prepared to go. He was not prepared to grant any injunction restraining identification of either the mother or P&#8217;s father. I agree entirely with that approach. There are, as I have already acknowledged, the most obvious and compelling reasons why, in this case, there should be no stifling of the widest possible public discussion of what has happened nor any stifling of the mother if she wishes to speak out. Moreover, as I said last week (<span style="font-style:italic">Re P </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/4037" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 4037 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 4037 (Fam)</ref>, para 5):</p>

Accordingly, &#8230; there are &#8230; very compelling arguments that the mother should not merely be enabled to tell her story to the world at large (if that is what she wants), but moreover that she should be enabled to do so by reference to her name (by which I mean her maiden name rather than her married surname), as, indeed, if this is what she wants, allowing her photograph to be published.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was for these reasons that I made the order set out below. It is largely self-explanatory but two matters require explanation. The proviso at the end of paragraph 13 is designed to make explicitly clear that the injunction restraining identification of P does <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>prevent the mother identifying herself, as indeed she has already done, by her first and maiden names. The wording at the end of paragraph 16 gives effect to the agreement I referred to in paragraph 28 above. The point raised by Associated Newspapers was that there was no justification for a reporting restriction order to remain in place if P was returned to her mother&#8217;s care. I agree.</p>

This case must surely stand as final, stark and irrefutable demonstration of the pressing need for radical changes in the way in which both the family courts and the Court of Protection approach what for shorthand I will refer to as transparency. We simply cannot go on as hitherto. Many more judgments must be published. And, as this case so very clearly demonstrates, that applies not merely to the judgments of |High Court Judges; it applies also to the judgments of Circuit Judges.</p>

In the circumstances it may be useful for me to set out for the attention of a wider audience a most helpful note which was sent to my office on 12 December 2013 by Mike Dodd, legal editor of the Press Association. Having said that he was unable to attend the hearing the following day, and explained that he is the individual with responsibility for oversight of the Press Association&#8217;s Injunctions Alerts Service, Mr Dodd continued:</p>
