	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This is an application by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets (the Council) for a final injunction preventing the Respondents from disseminating information about prospective adopters, and to prevent the First and Second Respondents (the Mother and the Father) from approaching those adopters. I heard the application in the urgent applications list on Friday, and made the injunction sought, but given the pressures of the list I reserved my reasons which I set out here. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The background to the application is the proposed adoption of X, a 3 year old girl. There is a very long and complex procedural history regarding X, and her halfsiblings, which I do not need to set out in detail.  X was born in 2016 and was shortly thereafter made subject to an interim care order, her older half-siblings had also been subject to care orders. X was placed with proposed adopters in early 2017 and has been living with them since. The parents (the First and Second Respondents) both strongly opposed the care orders and the proposed adoption. There were protracted proceedings and, following receipt of a pre-action protocol letter, the Council formally withdrew the decision to &#8220;place&#8221; the child with the prospective adopters (within the meaning of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>). Between October 2017 and late 2019 X was therefore living with the proposed adopters as foster parents. A fresh decision to &#8220;place&#8221; the child for adoption with the proposed adopters was made in late 2019.  </p>

In those circumstances, on 17 May 2017 HHJ Atkinson, who had formerly had conduct of the care and placement proceedings and was, by then, considering the first adoption order application in respect of the child, made an order prohibiting the Respondents from publishing information which would identify the children, including X and their carers, and their addresses.  </p>

Ms Oroge was away from her desk and Ms Roberts contacted Ms Oroge&#8217;s paralegal in her absence requesting the bundle. The paralegal sent the adoption bundle which contained a copy of the Rule 14.11 report containing the adopters&#8217; confidential information. Ms Oroge was not aware that the adoption bundle had been sent. The adoption report was confidential pursuant to FPR14.11(6) </p>

The proposed adopters took a precautionary decision to move out of their home address while the matter was investigated. A safety planning meeting was arranged for 12th October 2017. </p>

[Mother] listed the website where the carers details can be found, mentioning that an &#8220;injunction&#8221; will probably be taken out on them soon due to them often visiting neighbouring areas of Basildon including &#8220;spiritual church&#8221;.

The Council did make an error in sending the bundle and the confidential report to the First Respondent&#8217;s solicitors, but the greatest error was those solicitors passing it on to the First Respondent. In any event, it is ultimately irrelevant how the material got into the hands of the Respondents, the important point is to prevent any actions being taken upon it.  </p>

It therefore appears to me to be plain that there is no requirement for any particular formality, e.g. the application being in writing or being made separately before the application for the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">However, further than that, I do not accept that the orders made by myself on 11 March and Moor J on 13 March were invalid. The question of whether the failure to follow some procedural or regulatory step before an order or public law decision is made renders that order or decision invalid, is a complicated one. The argument was only raised in this case in Ms Obi-Ezekpazu&#8217;s Position Statement received on the morning of the hearing. She had not argued before Moor J on 13 March that he had no power to grant the order sought because no application had been made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.100(3)</ref>. In those circumstances the issues about the validity of those earlier orders was not fully argued out before me. Given the complexity of the case law and the fact that the issue is ultimately unnecessary for me to decide, I think it is best if I do not seek to determine that issue in this judgment. I do note however, that given that there are no procedural requirements under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.100(3)</ref>, there is a strong argument that it was implicit within the two earlier orders made that leave was being granted by both myself and Moor J, albeit that was not recorded in the orders themselves.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I turn then to the issue of whether on the facts the making of the order is justified. Ms Obi-Ezekpazu and the Second Respondent argued that the order is draconian and unjustified. It is argued that it puts the First Respondent at risk of committal for breach and as such is an order which unjustifiably interferes in their rights.  Ms ObiEzekpazu argues that the First Respondent has not breached the earlier order and there is no basis for thinking that she would disseminate the information. The First Respondent has said that she has deleted all the information, save for a photo of X, and that together with an undertaking to not publish should be sufficient.  </p>

The order merely prevents the First and Second Respondent from disseminating information which they should not have been given in the first place, and from approaching or seeking any contact with X or the proposed adopters. These are actions that the Respondents should not be undertaking in any event, and which they say they do not intend to do. I therefore cannot see why the order should be termed draconian or interferes with their rights. There is no risk of increased penalisation, because if there was a breach of the order and that was also covered by the 2017 order, then plainly it would be considered by any future court as one matter.  </p>

The two are in my view completely interlinked. Any action in respect of the proposed adopters may well have a significant impact on X because she is living with them. Importantly this is not a case where the risk is purely theoretical. The Respondents have already been convicted of harassing HHJ Atkinson. Further, as Ms Williams sets out, there is a history of the Respondents posting material on the internet about the children.  Although the Second Respondent was adamant before me that he and the First Respondent have no desire to go back to prison and that he feels aggrieved because the conviction is held against them, the fact is that they have been prepared to break the law in the past. I also take into account what the First Respondent is reported to have said to the contact workers, and the apparent history, as recorded by Ms Williams, of the Respondents publishing information about the children. In these circumstances there has to be a real risk that they will seek to identify the proposed adopters and where they live. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I accept that there is some overlap between the order I am asked to make and the order HHJ Atkinson made in May 2017. However, the overlap is not complete and the proposed order serves an important purpose. Firstly, the 2017 orders only cover &#8220;publication&#8221; and not wider &#8220;dissemination&#8221; of information. The difference may be important given the Respondents history of placing material on the internet and social media. Secondly, the proposed order specifically prevents the Respondents from approaching the proposed adopters or taking any steps to locate them. This is important in the context of the protection of X and the proposed adopters.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Secondly, the making of the order does not imply that I consider it likely that the Respondents will breach it: the imposition of an injunction is designed to prevent, or address, a risk that might arise were an injunction not made. The test is whether, having regard to the gravity of the harm feared, and having regard to its likelihood, the balance of harm and the interests of the child falls in favour of granting the injunction, whilst also having regard to the prejudice caused to the respondents of the imposition of the injunction, that test is met. No prejudice arises to the parents in the context of the decision Mostyn J is to make as a consequence of that determination. </p>
