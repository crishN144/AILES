From their relationship they have one child, a daughter, who was born in June 1996.  Sadly, the relationship between the parents broke down and they separated in 2001.  The daughter then lived primarily with her mother, but had regular contact with her father, including staying contact and trips abroad with him.  As I understand it, neither parent formed significant new relationships and neither has any other children.  </span></p>

During September 2011, the mother telephoned the father&#8217;s mother and told her that the daughter would not be having any further contact with the father or indeed any other members of the paternal family.  That must, of course, have caused the utmost anxiety and despair upon the part of the father.  </span></p>

That, in itself, is a necessarily arbitrary statutory cut off point.  The contact in the present case had ended when the child was just fifteen.  The inter-solicitor correspondence had begun in December 2011 when the child was still some six months before the age of sixteen.  It is, in my view, somewhat exaggerated to characterise the making even of an initial application as to contact in relation to a child then aged about fifteen and a half as either &#8220;a form of harassment&#8221; or as &#8220;an abuse of the court process&#8221;.  </span></p>

As appears to be the practice, appropriately there had been no preparation by that stage of detailed statements by either parent and each simply submitted a short, relatively objective, narrative statements of the history.  As I understand it, a CAFCASS officer met the child in the building and had some discussion with her.  As a result, it was reported to both parents and the district judge that the child was firmly expressing an unwillingness, at that stage, to see her father and in particular that she did not wish to do so in the period leading up to her GCSE examinations.  In a part of the hearing which has since been transcribed the district judge was later to say:</span></p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8220;&#8230;the CAFCASS officer has told us that, for whatever reason, [the child] feels that her father can be controlling.  It all amounts to pressure.  &#8230;in relation to the issue of contact, [the child] has made her views quite well known, that she wishes to think about whether she wishes to contact her father after her GCSEs.  In relation to indirect contact, [the father&#8217;s counsel] asked the CAFCASS officer about whether it was appropriate for the father to write to her and [the officer] said &#8216;Yes&#8217;, and obviously I would ask that that be done after she completes her GCSEs and if she wants to reply then she can do so.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">So it was that, without resistance by or on behalf of the father who, as I understand it, fully - even if sadly - accepted what was reported by the CAFCASS officer, the district judge ordered that there be no order on the father&#8217;s application as to contact.  </span></p>

The solicitor said: &#8220;I know it is unusual&#8221;, but then pointed to the correspondence in which she had, it is fair to say, made plain from the outset that there would be an application for costs.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">After hearing further submissions on behalf of each parent, the district judge ordered the father to pay the mother&#8217;s costs, which were summarily assessed in the amount of the schedule, namely &#163;2,468.  I mention at once that neither at the hearing before the district judge nor at this hearing has there been any issue as to the reasonableness of the costs claimed as to quantum.  But the father strongly challenged and, by his proposed appeal, continues to seek to challenge, the proposition that he should have been ordered to pay any of the mother&#8217;s costs at all.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">As is of course very well known, the Family Procedure Rules 2010 disapply that part of the Civil Procedure Rules that provides a starting point that the unsuccessful party pays the costs of the successful party.  As Lord Justice Wilson memorably says in one case, the effect is that in family cases of this kind the court simply starts with a blank sheet of paper.  The district judge was later to say in his judgment: </span></p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8220;The court has a broad discretion to make such order as it thinks just, and the court has to consider in the circumstances whether it is right to order the father to pay costs, whether by reason of his litigation conduct or simply because it is the right thing to do.  That appears to be the test.&#8221;</span></p>

	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">It does not seem to me that there is any significant error in that broad description by the district judge of the discretion that he was exercising, or as to the approach.  He referred to the fact, as was self-evident, that the father had received legal advice (the content of which was unknown to the district judge, as it remains to me) and that, having decided to make an application for contact, the responsibility for that decision lay upon the father.  That also seems to me to be a perfectly correct and appropriate appraisal by the district judge.  The father is a gentleman of mature years and patent intelligence and full capacity, and he was, and indeed remains, fixed with responsibility for decisions that he took whether acting with the benefit of legal advice or not.</span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8220;Am I sympathetic on a human basis to any parent concerned about their child?  Of course the court is, but this is a court and it is costly to bring proceedings.  This is not a meeting house.  Although [counsel for the father] said that he simply wished to come here to establish the child&#8217;s wishes and feelings, it is not appropriate to use this court simply to do that through the means of conciliation.  I appreciate the establishment of wishes and feelings of the child is part and parcel of the process, but the father should have stood back and asked himself whether really there was any chance at all - whatever she said to the CAFCASS officer - of the court being willing to make any order at all.  I agree with [the solicitor for the mother] that this was an entirely misconceived application where the result and conclusion was absolutely foregone.   She is nearly sixteen years of age.  It would be highly unusual for the court to make an order and the father should have thought about that&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The overall decision, whether or not to grant permission to appeal, remains discretionary.  In deciding whether or not and how to exercise that discretion, the court must, amongst other matters, apply the relevant overriding objective.  The overriding objective as elaborated in rule 1.1 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 is not, in all respects, the same as in rule 1.1 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998.  First, there is a reference in para.1.1(1) of the Family Procedure Rules to &#8220;any welfare issues involved&#8221;.  However, within the four corners of this proposed appeal there are simply no welfare issues involved.  It is simply about costs and a sum of money quantified at &#163;2,468.  It is right also to say that there are certain references within the overriding objective in rule 1.1 of the Civil Procedure Rules to the financial position of each party, which are not directly repeated or reflected in the Family Procedure Rules.   But the elaboration of the overriding objective in each of the rules is an inclusive and not an exhaustive one.  In a case which is purely concerned with a small sum of money, it seems to me to be no less appropriate to have some regard to the financial position of each party, whether the overriding objective under consideration is that in the Family Procedure Rules or that in the Civil Procedure Rules.  Under both elaborations of the overriding objective, the court has to consider allotting to the case &#8220;an appropriate share of the court&#8217;s resources, while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">This proposed appeal concerns no more and no less than the sum of &#163;2,468.  We know from the costs schedules that were prepared for the hearing on 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> March 2012 that the costs of the father&#8217;s representation on that day itself were in aggregate &#163;1,450 plus VAT.  The solicitor on behalf of the mother appeared without counsel and her costs of attending that day were &#163;825 plus VAT.  Informed by those figures and bearing in mind that it would not be unreasonable of the mother to instruct counsel if there were to be a substantive appeal, it seemed probable that the costs on each side of a proposed appeal could not be less than at least &#163;2,000 inclusive of VAT, or aggregate costs of a minimum of &#163;4,000 and probably somewhat more.  When I put those figures to Miss Rayson, however, she told me (what does not appear from any of the documents in the case) that she and her solicitor were so moved by their sense of injustice at the costs order in this case that they had already reached an irrevocable agreement with their client that they would act entirely free of charge throughout the proposed appeal proceedings.  In short, his sole costs of the proposed appeal were and will remain limited to the court issue fee of &#163;115 and the fee for obtaining a transcript of part of the hearing below of &#163;76, making a total of &#163;191.  So Miss Rayson was able to say to me that, on his side, the total costs hazarded, as it were, by the father on his proposed appeal are in fact &#163;191, which she submits is a proportionate amount to spend when appealing an allegedly unfair and unjust order for the payment of &#163;2,468.

Just because the lawyers for the father have decided, most generously, to act free of charge is not, of course, any reason why the lawyers for the mother should do so. As I have said, it seems reasonable to assume that her minimum costs would be of the order of &#163;2,000, so, even if one treats the costs on the father&#8217;s side as limited to &#163;191, the proposed appeal would still involve hazarding at least &#163;2,000 in relation to an issue of &#163;2,468.  </span></p>
