	      </authorialNote>. These judgments tell some, but by no means all, of the story of the ill-fated marriage of the parties which ended as long ago as 1999, when divorce proceedings began in the Canterbury County Court. Since then there have been dozens of hearings before numerous judges, many of whom are now retired; some are now dead.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">There is no doubt that the respondent is an exceptionally vexatious litigant. I made the original extended civil restraint order on 15 April 2014. It has been extended by orders made by me and the Court of Appeal and is currently scheduled to expire on 24 January 2020. The order has not been effective to restrain the respondent&#8217;s vexatious conduct, as I will explain. The respondent has not confined his vexations to these proceedings. For example, an extended civil restraint order was imposed on him by Gilbart J in 2017 as the culmination of an extremely protracted and toxic dispute with his local planning authority where he had made wild allegations and was found to have litigated totally without merit<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="6">

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I had hoped that my judgment of 25 January 2018 would bring closure to this case. After all, I reasoned that following the implementation of my order made on that occasion there would be nothing left to litigate about. That was, predictably, a hope built on sand. Since then the respondent has continued his campaign against his wife, his children, and his wife&#8217;s legal representatives unrestrained. He has continued to bombard the court with emails and spurious applications. He has widened the scope of his barrage to include an utterly meritless application to the Administrative Court, seeking judicial review of my decision to appoint a receiver back in 2014. We have counted at least 50 emails sent by him to the court since my order was made. He has bombarded the applicant&#8217;s solicitor with emails. Paragraph 19 of my principal order made on 25 January 2018 provided that he was restrained from communicating with the applicant&#8217;s solicitor via her domestic email address. The respondent has been in blatant breach of this injunction and has sent to the applicant&#8217;s solicitor dozens of messages to her domestic email address.  </p>

By March 2018 he was stating that he had reported the applicant&#8217;s counsel to the Bar Standards Board, her solicitor to the Solicitors Regulation Authority and both of them to the police on suspicion of perjury and fraud. In August 2018 the respondent instructed a firm of solicitors, RFH Solicitors, who wrote to the applicant&#8217;s solicitors challenging the validity of the principal financial remedy orders made in 2006; alleging that the recovery of funds by the receiver from the respondent&#8217;s pension was unlawful; and alleging that in relation to the applicant&#8217;s Form E there had been material nondisclosure and that therefore the principal financial remedy orders should be impeached.  </p>

Such permission is necessary because, of course, the respondent is the subject of an extended civil restraint order. I gave the applicant permission to file evidence in response and in my ruling on 7 March 2019 I rejected the application as &#8220;wholly unmeritorious&#8221;. I commented that the application was &#8220;a yet further example of the wholly unreasonable and punitive approach of Captain Wilmot to this very extensive litigation which has been detailed in my many judgments and those of my predecessors&#8221;. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On 26 July 2019 the respondent made an application which is largely incoherent. Inasmuch as I can understand it, he seems to be seeking that the original application for a financial remedy made nearly 20 years ago should be relisted on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to hear this case, and never has. Further, he asserted that the order empowering the receiver to collect the judgment debt from his pension was unlawful. He stated: &#8220;the hearing must be in a higher court and not in the UK Family Division&#8221;. That application was placed before me and I treated it as an application for permission pursuant to FPR PD4B paras 3.3 &#8211; 3.5. On 31 July 2019 I refused the application. The respondent repeated the application, or something like it, on 24 September 2019 which I refused on 4 October 2019. On this occasion I directed pursuant to FPR PD4B para 3.3(b) that the decision was final and that there was no </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Meanwhile, on 2 September 2019 the respondent applied to the Administrative Court for permission to seek judicial review and for urgent interim relief. His application named the applicant&#8217;s solicitors and the &#8220;Family Court of England and Wales&#8221; as defendants and cited the receiver as an interested party. It was a bizarre application seeking to &#8220;strike out&#8221; my orders of January 2018 and to return all the funds recovered from his pension. It alleged, as is his habitual refrain, that this court had no jurisdiction. </p>

It was completely misconceived. The scheme of FPR PD4B paras 3.3 &#8211; 3.5 is that where a civil restraint order is in force the prior permission of the nominated judge is needed before a substantive application can be made. By virtue of para 3.6(c) the application must be determined <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">without a hearing</span>. This is what happened. If the applicant for permission wishes to challenge a refusal, then his only remedy is an appeal &#8211; see para 3.8. That right of appeal can be curtailed by a direction under paragraph 3.3(b). I made such a direction in relation to the application made on 24 September 2019; but I did not do so in relation to the application made on 26 July 2019. Therefore, if the respondent wished to challenge my decision, he had 21 days from 31 July 2019 to file a notice of appeal. He did not do so and is now well out of time. </p>

I am fully satisfied that this criterion is satisfied in this case given the fact I have set out above. This is one of the worst cases of vexatious litigation misconduct that I have ever encountered. The extended order just has not worked.  Therefore, a general order is amply justified.
